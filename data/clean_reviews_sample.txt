talk about wow if anyone ever asked me what my favorite cookie in nyc was its from levains bakery coming from a person who has tried almost every dessert in this city these cookies are out of this world just the right amount of gooeycrisp ratio in every bite when youre finished these cookies will have you on your knees begging for more my favorite would have to be levains chocolate chip walnut cookie even though may be steep to spend on only one cookie youll understand why after just one bite since levains has become such a popular establishment it does get pretty busy i would say avoid weekend lines and go during the morning or a random weekday even if you do end up going during their busy hours it will be worth the wait
mighty quinns is a fastcasual barbecue chain with locations across manhattancalling it the chipotle of bbq isnt quite accurate given how brisk their delivery business seems to be versus takeout but ill take it for the general high quality low price point good enough level that most locations seem to put out the food stands up pretty well to delivery and if youre getting it from the comfort of seamless i predict an average to positive experience but if youre willing to make the trek to east village flagship which apparently makes the food for the other locations you can find some truly standout barbecuei first ventured here via jane ds suggestion to try the ribs these are probably their best tender just short of falloffthebone and not at all greasy the pulled pork is also exceptional a fattier blend than typical resulting in a sloppy and gluttonous sandwich cut with crisp cucumbers and sharp pickled red onionsother meat brisket chicken has been high quality but on the dry side their barbecue sauce isnt anything out of the ordinary but its satisfying and works with all of their options i havent explored the sides too much yet being a small human typically sated with their singleportion meat serving the kale salad is pretty average the sweet potatoes are splendidprices are good i typically spend under here including tax and tip service varies in terms of attitude but its always efficient theres a bathroom with a lock codeoverall i found the meat here to be better than expected given the corporate vibe and mass production a reliable pick for nyc barbecue and an increasing part of my diet

did i just eat the burger in new york city the double stack burger was absolute perfection on a plate it had that umami factor and albeit steep price it just felt so satisfying to bite into itthere was dimension and tons of flavor i loved the sauteed onions the sweet bun and pickles the overall flavor was just very memorable i was eating it unmodified and just the way they usually serve it and it was satisfying and i did not finish it so portion is great for the price at least for mei would love to come back for the pizza and definitely could see myself coming back here in general service was good my only pet peeve was that our group of all ordered burgers and it took a very long time to get all of them out some of us felt too awkward to eat ours it was a corporate lunch and waiting made things soggy
so places like this really do existlike many of us i grew up romanticizing new york i watched saturday night fever and desperately seeking susan and goodfellas and most importantly sex in the city and like many of us was probably far too young for the content at the time i saw a swanky luxurious life filled with unthinkable embellishments then i moved here and realized that theres a thing called rent and another thing called student loans and another thing called taxes and i started to resent carrie bradshaw and her ridiculous and impossible apartment well i digress that world of splendor i pined for with every cell of my being does existalbeit on a different scaleat manhatta it starts from the moment you walk in a wellgroomed host in the lobby leads you to an elevator that makes one stop only floor you float up into paradise into a world where people bring you things you didnt know you wanted and you can pretend for a night that this is the norm now that you while always dine amongst the starsmanhatta has done a magical thing it manages to perfectly package ideal manhattan experience this is a place for a special occasion a sweeping dining room bound by floortoceiling windows that look out on the entire city with a prix fixeonly menu timing is executed perfectly and servers twirl in with your next course just as you start thinking youd like to move to the next thing its seasonal refined american fare with a topnotch mixology program as well we did something very out of the ordinary for me which is drop in to a very popular venue without a reservation i never heed the whole we accept walkins at our bar full dinner menu but this past saturday i the fire in my belly was strong enough as if this place wasnt already magical enough we exited the elevator and found ourselves staring at two empty seats at the bar dream it and believe it friendsperhaps the view wasnt quite as spectacular sitting at the bar but we had an added bonus of watching our bartender fix up some fantastic drinks we both stuck with cocktails here despite the impressive wine list and im glad we did the drink menu changes frequently so sadly i cant report much of what we had but i can speak to two on the current online menu the castle garden gin benedictine honey lime angostura the manhatta new york distilling ragtime rye punt e mes lustau east india sherry bitters both wellexecuted a yummy my favorite drink of the night was a stirred vodka cocktail brand new to the menu i dont like vodka so the idea of a stirred vodka drink sounds awful at first but the bartender convinced me as a fellow vodkadisenthusiast its worth your time we came during valentines day weekend the actual day was so the bar was offering its usual a la carte menu most dishes are totally different than the tasting menu as well as a fourcourse meal for pretty steep considering their threecourser is but the dishes looked so good we couldnt pass it up thats the last time we ball out for a while but it was worth it our eats belowcitrus salad w labneh roasted beets hazelnut alight and refreshing sophisticated an elegant the ideal first course kind of served as an amuse bouche great use of both texture and flavorlobster quenelle w mushrooms roasted lobster emulsion aoh man this is where it started to get decadent i had never heard of this particular lobster preparation before but it was just divine rich and warming lobster twoways is luxurious and comforting very uniquesoft scrambled eggs w uni ai had a similar preparation once at a restaurant in philly which was out of this world so everything else pales in comparison so this didnt blow me away given the reference i had but its still delicious rich and creamy youll want to take a bath in it foie gras amore luxury in the form of liver served with some sort of mustard and maybe some sort of kraut this isnt on the online menu so im doing my best all components meshed wellbites compliments of the kitchen brought out during our first coursechicken liver mousse w everything bagel seasoning a eat this with bread eat this plain delicacy after delicacy will greet you hereoysters acant remember the accompaniments but these were fresh and delicious a nice interlude before the rest of the mealcrescent duck w offal sausage confit endive prunes acooked perfectly a beautiful winter entree rich subtle sweetandsavory melody going on served in some yummy sauce and punctuated with candied nuts and more citruswagyu coulotte w mushrooms celeriac turnips beet jus aanother beautifully seasonal dish excellent cook on the meat i almost never eat red meat but our meal and manhatta proved to be an ideal opportunity to splurge though i do feel ill need a steady diet of veggies and quinoa for the next week as a result
visited yaras based on the recommendation of a friend and im glad i did upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess but that was just the beginning of our great experience the next thing that caught our attention was the decor and ambience it was obvious that attention was paid to every detail the place is gorgeousafter being sat we were greeted by a friendly waitress who took our appetizer and drink orders not too long after the chef came to our table to greet us and give us some recommendations for our entrees i ended up choosing the mixed grill platter and my date chose the salmon which was the catch of the day while waiting for our order jacob the owner came by our table to check on how things were going he was very pleasant funny and welcoming our food came out fairly quickly and as soon as we dug into each of our dishes we were blown away by the wonderful flavors their salmon is the best ive ever had in new york yeah i said it it was fn amazing it was so good i suggested that they make it a permanent item on the menu the mixed grill platter was also great but that salmongeeeez both dishes were served with mixed veggies and rice dont forget to ask for a side of toumlebanese garlic sauceyara has great potential and i definitely see it taking off and becoming one of the it spots in the city i cant wait to go back and explore the rest of the menu
look when i first heard about sleep no more i thought that it sounded like a terrible high school art project an interactive version of macbeth with no dialogue where you just roam around the set and wait for things to happen i was wrong this is the best show in nyc and if you are visiting i recommend it immensely and i typically have no truck for avantgarde stuff cant really understand performed dance and am a cultural aesthetic simpleton whose favorite movies are legally blonde and miss congeniality but i was mesmerized by this thing the set design is unreal and so are the performances ive never seen anything like it in the decades to come as ai ascends we will be intensely debating the question what makes humans truly human well let me tell you something its creations like sleep no more testaments to human creativity stretched to their absolute maximum bounds good golly wowthe only thing i suggest to the producers is theyve got to do something about pushy audience members who think its ok to just shove other people aside no this kind of unwanted behavior should be halted by the various black masked security personnel im also going to add that handholding should be banned because it slows down the flow of foot traffic and causes bottlenecks even though they recommend you explore this individually certain couples here cant psychologically afford to let go for even hours i believe there are two things at work alarming codependency or worse the man who feels he has to protect his partner and cant let her go ive seen both and neither bodes well for longterm relationship dynamics
theres something special about their macarons unique flavors and combinations they really are top notch i absolutely love the key lime pie ice cream macaron sandwich which is sweet and tart a piece of heaven in each bite it seems as they always have something new here sweets from wall to wall you really cant go wrong they even have an early grey tea macaron and guess what all of the products sold here is plant based reasonably priced for ny macarons and delectable to boot im a yuge fan and im sure you will be too
the bronx zoo is a great way to spend a wednesday why wednesday because its by donations they also have seasonal events that can be fun for the family and young ones for easter they had an egg scavenger hunt a birdathon coming up in may and a garden event by farm on now in june on top of that they have a theater with built in sensory effects my niece loved it so much the first five minutes and then she fell asleep from fatigue one of her favorite things to do was the bug carousel she choose to ride on top of the firefly now the coolest thing ever that i discovered during my visit was the naturetrek i actually did it with my niece cause im a kid at heart and i did not have this as a child lol the naturetrek was my favorite it was very cool navigating through bridges balancing beams and weaves between obstacles it was very impressive to see how well this was built the bronx zoo also has sea lions and penguins feedings where you can watch them now in the childrens zoo section you can actually feed the animal yourself where you can dispense pellets from a quarter machine to feed the sheep goats and donkeys they also have camel rides from those who want to ride we skip that part we got the total experience and the camel ride was not included but it did include a lot such as the butterfly garden childrens zoo congo gorilla forest jungle world theater bug carousel wild asia monorail and zoo shuttle the prices for an adult is and kids and up overall a very fun experience
cup cup is my new favorite lunch spot in the herald square area okay its a few minutes walk from herald square but close enough ambiancewise its more of a cafe than a restaurant but they serve up some great food and its very affordable you can order a rice or noodle dish for or choose from a combo for a dish a drink less than for a dish a drink over for two dishes a side a drink only downside to this option is that the dishes are prepicked for youive tried the karaage california rice and japanese curry rice bowls and loved them all the portion size is perfect for lunch the karaage bowl was especially filling though the japanese curry one couldve used more curry and croquette relative to the amount of rice if im in a splurgey mood then i usually get an iced green tea latte along with my meal which is also excellentthe baristascashiers are consistently friendly and there is always ample seating available and mellowindie music playing in the background ive never had to wait too long for my food during lunchtime either the longest was probably minutes my only gripe about this place is that theyre cash only but everything comes out to a conveniently even amount etc that even this is only a minor issue overall i highly recommend cup cup for lunch

umami overload i love this place i mean i know its going to be good before hand its pasta and seafood it just have to be good but marea exceeded my already high expectationsi was there for my birthday and did the four course pf menu did i mention this is a michelin two star restaurant and the pf is btw you get a lot of foodi think its really good value considering the food service and the ambience the biggest surprise comes from the raw sliced snapper with caviar sooooo good soooo umami imy pictures are literally crap btw they dont really do the food justice best pasta i have ever eaten in my life period
having been to the fidi location when i used to live down there i was hyped to see this location under construction while walking around work my two coworkers and i visited the second day after they opened for lunch and i am extremely happy to report that the sandwiches here are just as good as i rememberedthe counter attendants were welcoming and cheerful open to giving you their own personal favorites and suggestions if you are overwhelmed by the long list of options we tried the parma prosciutto smoked mozz sundried tomatoes arugula bari salami fresh mozz olive paste sundried tomatoes and trieste proscuitto fresh mozz balsamic dressing arugula and enjoyed all of them you can choose the bread you prefer im a big fan of the focaccia but the ciabatta is also perfection the ingredients are very fresh and high quality and i can die happy after eating the sundried tomato olive paste combo there is also a good selection of vegetarian options and another one of my coworkers tried the capri bufala mozz fresh tomatoes arugula evoo on semolina the verdict was v good sandwich heart buffalo mozz and the semolina is italian chef kissing fingers i was also told to emphasize that you can taste that its real evoo and not some cheap knockoff the sandwich sizes here are absurdly massive ask them to cut your sandwich into so you can save some for a snack dinner alternatively life is too short for regret so choose your own adventure and eat as much as you want in one sitting methere is a credit card minimum but nearly all the sandwiches will allow you to meet that minimum come here but also dont make the line too long kthxbye

we had our team holiday party here and i couldnt have asked for a better experience for our group of we reserved the back room and it was so lovely we had a private bar with plenty of space complete with tons of christmas decorations think christmas tree lights and moving trains theres curtains that separate the rest of the bar from the private room and you also have your own private bathroom too the food mac and cheese we had a bucket of mac and cheese and it wasnt enough so good spinach and artichoke dip also incredible the pita is soft warm and fluffy duck fat fries you cant go wrong with duck fat fries ever sliders the bun was kind of hard but still good chipotle glazed wings really good flavor truffle burrata melt in your mouth good spinach salad brussels sprouts not bad but wasnt a crowd favorite dessert sampler this was so much food tons of ice cream cake cheesecake etcerich was on point with drinks and any other requests we had during the night cant recommend enough
this place just makes me happy who wouldnt like gelato its just a wonderful little gelato shop in chelsea today was a particularly amazing day for it beacuse i dropped in and the weather was warm the service here is always so friendly on top of everything your always greeted with a smile just walking into this place takes you back to childhoodso i got flavors beacuse with so many choices you just cant get one i actually started out with pistachio then thought it was a good idea to add on tiramisu beacuse why wouldnt i then it esculated to hazelnut and a burbon flavor when they asked me if i wanted the little macaroon on top my only reply was pistachio please i sat down and begun to eat as i ate i actually realized that i probably got alittle too much and probably could have opted for a smaller size but you only live once so why not overall i know im right around the corner so ill probably be back until ive managed to try every flavor pluse some its always a great experience ill never go back to regular ice cream again thanks guys
im not a big consumer of food trucks however i do love these guys i used to work around the corner from them and i would hit them up every lunch for my falafel no tomatoes tahini and hot sauce with a diet coke for of all cant beat the price and secondly theyll make the falafel on the spot its always fresh and sooo good never a disappointment fast forward a year later where i havent worked at that store location im a freelance artist and i popped over to grab a bite on the go and my dude totally remembered my order like whatsuper people who work there out in the cold and ny summer heat all day everyday if youre in and around the upper west side stop over get some good food and chill out at lincoln center or central park
we thought we liked our fried fish place down in gun hill now im thinking weve been doing it all wrong but when harbour appeared on the hot new restaurants in mamaroneck you know it was on my list idea came from hubby and suggested we have lunch here mind you we even talked not too long ago about how much white plains and other nearby towns were in dire need of a fried fish placei actually noticed them closed on their yelp page but i googled and called them anyway sure enough person i spoke to over the phone was energetic so we went located a block away from e boston post road and the mamaroneck harbor harbour fish is a fantastic addition to the area quiane her mom and harbours chef hailing from the city island strip are bringing something wayyyyyy different from the typical and bland fish fry places weve all came to enjoy at one time or another especially if you lived in the bx bk qns nyc few things to theyre closed on sundays but given the weather was nice and it was super bowl sunday she wanted to test the waters and see what the foot traffic was like harbour isnt sitdown theyre only take out howeverwas told when weather gets nice there will be some outside seating we were impressed harbour has their friers and counter space on left wall they offer fresh seafood up front followed by more counter space and raw veggies for their steamed or boiled dishes hubby went all in with whiting fried fish sandwichtartar sauce on the side jumbo fried shrimp to share and cod fried fish sandwich sans chipotle mayo for me at this point im like all over harbour and prices are fair i thought after that i just wanted to get home and chow down the food you wanna know shrimp and fish arent just fried quiane and her chef use the perfect amount of a real slamming and seasony dredge on all their fried seafood and it shows they take pride in what theyre putting out and thats fresh seafood and a damn good fish fry everything was very very good and definitely the best fried fish sandwich and seafood ive had in a long time the name says it alli need to make plans to return
i was kind of afraid that this place would be just another solid not outstanding overpriced token ethnic cuisine spot in new york you know what i mean there are so many and most arent really worth checking outi was very pleasantly surprised by mari vanna firstly the interior was gorgeous photos dont do it justice its beautiful slightly kitschy and twee and feels like it might have come out of the manor of a lesser noble in st petersburg ive been the decor is a refreshing change from the standard ultra moderntrendy ambiance of most nyc establishments and is worth the trip aloneluckily the food is delicious as well dinner is probably pricier but at lunch they serve a prix fixe that includes a hefty appetizer and entree which is a great deal we ordered the salmon salad herring yum if you like raw fish chicken stroganoff and beef pelmeni portions and quality were good and quite tasty i confess that i am generally a huge fan of eastern european food meat smoked fish and potatoes whats not to like for lunch i also enjoyed the food and ambiance much more than veselka more of a diner and find both establishments to be similarly priced in which case mari vanna is the clear winneri read some reviews stating that service was bad but during lunch the servers were very friendly and responsiveworth the trip
i would like to review this restaurant as a vegetarian vegan restaurant rather than just a korean restaurant so please consider this when you are thinking about this reservations make a reservation you will have to call into the restaurant to make one but be sure to make the ambiance amazing dark woody balanced with some kind of perfect otherness to it that is for me not easy to describe other than to tell you that i felt so comfortable lose the shoes uyes you will be sitting in a traditional korean dining space with a low table but thankfully there is a recessed cavity for you to put your feet into so you wont have to sit crossed legged for the whole dinner for me that would have been a problem as my legs would have gone to the food amazing vegetarian food with a korean flaira spicy baby dumplings i ate this too fast to figure out what vegetables were in this but they were excellent kind of like a ravioli or a wonton with a unique tasteb combination pancakes which were leek pancakes kimchi mushroom and kabocha pumpkin pancakes all very good the kimchi mushroom was my favoritec todok stone bowl rice i never had todok before but wanted to try this on the recommendation of the waiter todok is a korean mountain root and it was delicious this was to me a unique and tasty bibimbap with the todok root very niced tofu with mixed vegetables my friend ordered this and enjoyed it it does not come with rice separately so you have to order a side of rice to really enjoy thise kimchi stone bowl rice this is also to me like bibimbap in a stone bowl with kimchi excellent what i like most about these stone bowls is that the bowls are so hot that the rice continues to cook and gets that crispy fried texture as if it was on the bottom of a cooked pan tasty great texture and fun to scrape and eat itf avocado stone bowl rice the avocado added a very creamy and rich texture to the meal very nicenot sure why we all ended up with rice bowls i wanted us to try the other items like the mushrooms but the waiter highly recommended the stone bowls and so for some odd reason most of the party ordered itfor dessert we had the chocolate mocha cake with a scoop of soy vanilla ice cream blueberry coconut cake and two mango sorbets excellent and extremely tastyas a vegetarian vegan restaurant the food here is absolutely outstanding the presentation the taste the choice the beauty of the creations are top notch loved it for a korean restaurant since i am not a vegan or vegetarian i did miss the great taste of meats cooked so well but hangawi was a very unique experience that i am so happy to have tried and will try again in the futuregk says check it out especially if your daughter is vegan and is in nyc for the first time

just opened weeks ago today and while rh rooftop enjoyed peace and quiet the words out nowlocated within the jaw dropping new rh in meatpacking on the floor is the gorgeous rh rooftop restaurant decked out in plush seating chandeliers for days and a rooftop with views you need to get here stat like their sister resto in chicago they do not take ressies we arrived just after opening and the place was empty left around and it was still only half full go nowof course besides the aesthetics the food was on point and excellent pricing for the environment i had the divine eggs w creme fraiche served alongside the most decadent and delicious buttered toast friend had the burger and it was massive didnt try it but was told it was excellent hubby got the turkey club which was a very generous portion all the plates come with sides either fries or side salad and lemme tell you fries all the way one of the best fries ive had and im a french fry expert so basically just trust me service was top notch and the bathrooms here oh myyyy dripping in marble and gold the ambiance here is certainly rh worthy and the food was delish to boot would return

by far the best omakase in new york city world renowned sushi chef tatsu is the best in the game in my opinion and thankfully he is in the heart of greenwich village located downstairs le boucherie on christopher street there are only seats and employees and its all they need beware of the brightness of light and i had go back to the terraces to grab sunglasses when we went the first time but if you expect an authentic japanese sushi omakase then this place is perfect no music brightly lit and the theater of sushi you wont believe the service and hospitality i never had an empty glass and returning to my seat at the sushi bar there are no tables my napkin is delicately folded and waiting for me we first went on an anniversary and we were gifted a book about tatsu i wish i had a book about me to give people when they came to my sushi restaurant but i do not have a sushi restaurant nor am i a sushi chef nor do i have a book so i just give people my fake music album on audio compact disc when they bring their own sushi to my standup has mentioned the toothpicks in the bathroom every time we go so dont miss out on that i just cant say enough good things about the sushi so i wont say anything at all for fear of using my entire vocabulary up in one yelp review and not being able to speak in public which is largely what i do for a living for me this is the crown jewel of japanese food in new york city tatsu is humble brilliant inventive and funny his associates are every bit as talented and essential his assistant wont make eye contact much but your eyes will roll back into your head when you taste the miso soup he prepares the best i have ever had the final piece not tamago is something so delicately prepared and delicious that it is at once a delicacy i have never encountered and reminiscent of the nostalgia of a childhood tunafish sandwich i have never had prawn sushi that rivals tatsusat it is expensive but yet a steal plan on paying for additional pieces if you go hungry we usually eat a final hand roll after my second prawn piece as our dessert i plan to come here every week i am in town so ill see you there ill be the one at the end of the bar trying not to fall out of my chair from satiation next to who will be hovering several inches off her seat because of the ambrosia its tatsupreme to the maximumthe original yelp gangstertj miller
this warm bowl of food made your girl so happyhashtag new year resolution but i could not stand another salad from sweetgreen so hello poke hashtag january in nyc and i needed some hot food in my stomach so hello red poke this place has been on my radar for a while and i know they are koreanowned which makes it ultra appealing to me not only because the food must be flavorful by definition but also i have the civil duty to support poc businesses plus i live literally across the streetthe customer service is amazing and the guy running the cash register was super patient and helpful people assembling the bowls were fast and everyone communicated well i got a large with tofu shrimp and salmon and all three proteins tasted fantastic they also have like different sauces to choose from so take that other poke joints the rice both white and brown is extremely moist just as you would expect from our korean fam out there a few things of i would probably not get the japchae again because i find it quite flavorless i guess you are supposed to mix it with a lot of sauce but i didnt dig the rice is kept warm in the rice cooker which is genius especially for the winter but it means that the white rice is not sushi rice with vinegar and all they forgot to give me kimchi which you have to pay extra for nonetheless i was satiated because they give you a healthy amount of each topping you the supergreens is really just spinach at least on my the avocado is stored as a mash in a container instead of being scooped out to order not necessarily a bad thing because ive seen some darn black avocado halves at salad joints just as an fyito be fair my experience was really a but my delicious bowl got my hopes up and i am convinced this place might actually be perfect i cannot wait to try their dumplings and sides and fully stamp my loyalty card
what an epic meal the theme here is enjoy the whole space has that warm spacious brewerystyle feeling that only comes from the midwest where this spot hails from these two dishes are the incredible the fried chicken packed with ginger and crunchy sesame in a korean sauce my surprising favorite divine their signature cheeseburger with bacon and egg oozing with yolk and thickcut bacon all the food here is so well balanced theyre working with hugely flavorful foods and somehow combining them into something harmonious and not too salted or too cheesy or too this or that such a feat we happened to unknowingly sit next to brandon the sous chef at the counter and he offered us a free dish of bone marrow piled high and with their warm beef cheek jam wowsa was this delicious brandon was so kind and generous and filled us in on how excited they are to finally open the doors to their nyc location our server jorge was also great and welcoming and urged us to take our time and stars
kenscale this time of the year i usually have one or two favorite restaurants in nyc in my mind my annual review will come out shortly thus far has been a strange year in that regard it was quite difficult to pinpoint any memorable moments throughout the culinary journey with my wife jun until my recent birthday dinner with my wife jun anyone who follows my reviews will know that as a native korean i can be pretty difficult to please when it comes to korean restaurants in the city after much deliberation on where i will celebrate my birthday with jun i ultimately decided on atomix and purchased tickets for two at per person it turned out that atomix is the best korean restaurant i had been to in new york city it also turned out that atomix is the best new restaurant in nyc that i had visited this year what distinguishes atomix from other finedining tasting menu places is the efforts that the restaurant has put into explaining the background behind each dish in its tencourse offering i have never come across a restaurant that has a flashcard describing the inspiration for each dish and this narrative element greatly adds to the tasting experience itself and each dish actually delivered with such astounding elegance lets start out with guk soup in korean with the maesaengi seaweed in the pork broth along with garlic custard and sea urchin from hokkaido the soup became one harmonious bowl that was aromatic and delicious atomixs brilliance lies in the way the kitchen uses unexpected ingredients in the way i had not expected in korean cuisine such as carrot that was fermented to give yellow sashimi hwe such a refreshing kick as described in the flashcard potato pancake jeon has not been considered peasant food given the low place of potato in the grain hierarchy of korean tradition but atomix has found a way to elevate it into a beautiful slice with ricotta cheese and a variety of flower and herb that was also delightfully crispy other dishes such as steamed snow crab jjim with white kimchi sauce pickled grenada pepper and smoked trout roe fried twigim soondae and a tart of celeriac buttermilk cheese hazelnut milk and caviar sukchae similarly displayed ingenuity and thoughtful execution our two best savory dishes came at the end the grilled gui golden eye snapper that came with kohlrabi compressed with white kimchi juice and nuruk a traditional fermentation starter sauce using snapper fish stock was so delicious that i had a hard time thinking of any other fish dish i had at a restaurant recently that was just as memorable similarly the braised jorim wagyu was a marvelous perfection in texture you will see an assortment of rice and lettuce with which you can make small wraps along with this beautiful meat accompanied by fermented red pepper each bite of wrap was just blissful and my only regret was that there were only four pieces of meat he two desserts that came out were also fascinating i didnt expect to see ice cream made of makgeolli but it sure was a delightful palate cleanser ipgasim and i began to wonder why other restaurants have not thought of using this popular rice wine for desserts the main dessert husik consisting of red bean crème fraiche persimmon and pine nut drew influence from winter solstice on which koreans eat red bean porridge patjuk and beautifully captured the modern interpretation of patjuk with the addition of persimmon that was aged with soju another popular korean liquor then roasted to give a smooth texture as noted above reservations at atomix can only be secured through ticket purchases one for pm and the other for pm each day online available at tock the intimate single chefs counter setting at the restaurant gives a modern yet unpretentious feel that is another positive contributor to the dining experience occasionally chef park comes out to serve a dish himself and his wife ms park walks around the counter making sure all the diners are properly attended to there is full bar with cocktails inspired by modern korean flavors and ingredients as well as a wine list mostly from france italy and us at the end of our meal jun and i took a photo with chef park and briefly spoke to ms park who noted that the menu changes every quarter thereby giving me a revelation that jun and i should visit this place whenever the menu is revamped so we so we get to see what kind of magic chef parks kitchen brings forward while also as a fellow native korean hopefully giving more moral support to this mildmannered yet ambitious korean couple in fact while our culinary journey has been mostly checking out new restaurants as they open we have decided that we will pick a few goto restaurants that we will want to visit more than twice every year atomix will be the first restaurant on that list

listen its sunday and its past my bedtime i said my voice wavering and becoming less resolute as joshua the bowtieclad host who gracefully also bartends spouts sake facts and jokes the good kind dangled an appetizing cocktail menu under our gazing eyes yes i stayed up past my bedtime to write about this place because it was that good everything about sushi by boū says come in relax dont worry about a thingupon arriving we had waited in the hotel lobby with sexy bachata music wafting from the speakers we received plastic key cards to the hotel suite the menu was tucked into the hotel card sleeve the key card opens the suite room door and joshua kindly took our coats as our evening began interestingly i had just attended an immersive theatre experience the night before and i feel like sushi by boū nailed it i love the way the hotel room creates a cleansing moment the moment you hear the whirring of the lock opening the moment that notifies you that you are about to be taken into another world its not the runofthemill jazz background music the music is hip and alive and the second you sit down at the four seat sushi bar you know its going to be a show our chef for the night ashi was serious and got down to business as the night went on we got to coax his winning smile out more than once he is mesmerizing to watch his hands flying yet so precise we knew we had one hour for the omakase menu pieces it was one of those experiences that simultaneously flew by because of how orgasmic every bite was but also seemed to stretch out for a pleasing amount of time because of the atmosphere the lighting and decor are careful to keep you in the experience i sort of love the timed omakase experience because youre never left wondering for minutes when your next piece is coming its right there in front of you my favorite pieces of night included the sea scallop uuuuh the uni uuuuuuuuuh and the toro uuuuuuuuuuuuh ashis eyes lit up when i moaned at the sea scallop because i mean it was his favorite too unbelievably fresh this is about making sushi your new boo bou this is about bringing the knowledge and experience of authentic fresh japanese style sushi not your caterpillar or california rolls okay to the world im amazed at the intimacy they achieve while being open to banter and lightheartedness its so refreshing and hot tip the summertimes gonna be fresh with their new patio bar so line your resy up for that date ill see you there room service and all ill even stay up past my bedtime for it after all you uni live once
we were at blue note back in september to see chick coreas trio perform up close and actually quite intimate as we were seated right next to the stage and chicks piano it was a memorable experience to say the leastchick corea on piano carlito de puerto on bass and marcus gilmore on drums as for the venue i can only remember the space is very close tables are tight as are most new york jazz clubs besides lincoln center i dont remember ordering food most likely drinks all i remember is chick corea and his band as we enjoyed a great rare performance dthey do have a menu of a variety of bar food appetizers entrées including filet mignon plus sandwiches burgers etc our cover charge was high but i believe the average is bar seats and for tables depending on the artist of course food and drinks are extra
if youve seen the television show series you on lifetime or bingewatched on netflix the exterior of this upper east side bookstore was filmed to portray mooneys bookstore the interior looks different since the interior of mooneys was filmed on a set in the bronx so you wont be seeing a glass box in the basement etchowever you will find a friendly cat named mr boo boo if you pet him long enough he may purr himself to sleep the staff here are very friendly and this is my favorite bookstore in the neighborhood they offer gift wrapping for any books and sell other items such as a fine assortment of greeting cards childrens books accompanied with puppetstoysstuffed animals and bookmarkstheres a couple boxes of used books not on the shelves where the price ranges are from hope you get to visit this friendly bookstore take home a nice book or two
delicious pastries and scones for the afternoon tea it was packed on a monday afternoon so definitely get reservations we ordered tea for plus lobster mac n cheese from the regular menu and shared between people we especially loved the curry chicken sandwich and the lemon tart the mac n cheese was to die for and definitely the best part of the meal great service too

what a way to start the new year waitress was awesome its definitely in my top of broadway shows out of about the music was like a symphony to my ears it was so beautiful this show created a wave of emotions in me i laughed cried wanted to get married get pregnant have an affair with my gynecologist and get a divorce all at the same time lol it was hilarious but it did touch on alot of real world issues like infidelity and emotional physical abuse the worst kinds of relationships are the ones youre least happy in the cast was spectacular and i cant wait to listen to the soundtrack happy
this place excels in all aspects from decor to service to food we had a bit of a wait when we came but since they take your number to text you when your tables ready it was fine we just went and walked around a bitwe were sat in the front in the section with tables before the bar our server was super attentive without being overbearing the decor is very elegant and calm and the noise level isnt too bad the food is the main attraction though i had the sansai mountain vegetables udon and my boyfriend had the tantanmen my sansai udon was clean and delicious very light yet flavorful my boyfriends tantanmen was spicy and deep and i might get that one next time both dishes were absolutely standout we also had the kinpira gobo which tasted just like i was back in japan i loved it and my boyfriend did too i will definitely be back here to try out some other dishes on the menu highly recommend
a extremely beautiful cemetery especially now with the beautiful foliage i want to thank the wonderful people at woolawn cemetery mslori locke family service counselor for making a difficult time a bit soothing and less stressful and the hugs helped also this week i got the phone call that my fathers tombstone was ready and i got to visit him on this beautiful fall day
the play the lifespan if a fact wdaniel radcliffeabout a demanding editor cherry jones a determined young fact checker daniel radcliffe and author bobby carnevale working on an essay that is to be published it was funny relatable and very relevant to the modern world especially as a young professional i can empathize and identify with daniel radcliffes characterthe transitions between scenes were great the person cast was amazing love the sets studio was a very intimate little theatre it was very easy to find our seats people are right that it isnt really staggering i found myself swaying back and forth depending on the person in front of me however the view was great besides that
emscuplt where athletics meets aesthetics i discovered dr neinstein when i came across emsculpt hes one of the very first doctors in nyc to implement emsculpt in his practice a noninvasive nonsurgical procedure that effortlessly builds muscles in your abs and butt the machine is fdaapproved and it is safe it claims to do about situps for you in minutes time resulting in about increase in muscle and decrease in fat in the abdominal regioni signed up for the emscuplt ab sessions which consist of sessions in a week period with days in between sessions each session lasted for minutes i was able to go to yoga and kickboxing after each session easily theres two paddles so you can bring a friend to do an ab session together the wait varies for my first appointment i was scheduled for but did not get called in until almost an hour later for my appointment i did not get in until about half hour later there was no wait for my and sessionsis it worth it totally but also depends on your lifestyle i would say go for the ab sessions if you work out consistently and have a bmi in the lower overall i really like the result
the cabin is the ultimate form of hygge that you can find in nyc with its woody interior and a literal tree lit with tiny fairy lightbrings much needed warmth in this brutal winter weather its an escape from cold wind and treating yourself to amazing cocktails with top shelf liquor i had a mountain mojito which had this crispiness from citrus cutting into any harshness of the alcohol which is how i like my cocktails they need to be well balanced and beautifully crafted the bartender are knowledgeable in their craft of making amazing drinks also the brussels sprouts were to die for amazing crispiness and slight sweet caramelization formed on the edges of the sprouts were divine definitely worth the price they do have a patio in development and i cant wait for itwill be coming back soon to try the mule next

meat nothing says korean bbq quite like a gigantic platter of freshly cooked meat im not much of a carnivore but i just had to make an exception the food was great service was excellent and the quality of everything was just mmmm so good prices are also what i would expect for this type of establishment kbbq is typically on the side but well worth it if you ask meif you like meat and good times you wont be disappointed
a great museum composed of many exhibits with lots of displays and great information with multiple floors large halls and additional exhibits that change occasionally theres a lot to see from the stars to the deep depths of the ocean youll end up walking quite a bit so wear comfy shoes food is pricey as are their souvenirs but thats new york for you the general admission which is pay what you want at the door will only allow you access to the main halls and attractions but the add on exhibits require additional tickets to be purchased before you can access those areas it is a very educational and kid friendly place to visit
i was hesitant about coming here due to their reviews but i had a great experience i think what makes this place a bit off for others is the fact that their menu changes every three months and the items on the menu are eccentric for example ive never had tuna sashimi with bacon bits it was strange but still very tasty the overall vibe here is eccentric i definitely recommend making reservationsthe staff was sweet and informative and the food was very fresh i would certainly return here
amy gross is a seasoned professional and a great teacher shes like that tough but funny teacher you had in junior high whom everyone respects and fears ever so slightly that you never forget amy manages class time very efficiently spending the first half on the handson baby cpr and heimlich techniques the second half of class on various safety tips then reinforcing the first part again before you leavehighly recommended for anyone looking to gain some confidence and peace of mind for basic infant first aid
wonderful lunch special course for starter main and dessert considering mains are around this is a great price really nice staff who are quite attentive we were a big group on a quiet day so they were nice and gave us free plates of appetizers veggie and meat samosas personally i picked lamb as a starter and main and then the kulfi ice cream for dessert next time id like to try the fig firni dessert rice custard lunch only has dessert choices btw presentation is really nice for everything but especially the rice fig firni
this is chinatown at its finest great food at super affordable price roast duck is a must try i wish i work closer to here so i can come for a cheap yet satisfying lunch everyday everything here is good meat is always tender flavorful and juicy its pretty much a hole in a wall but i love it its like the spirit of chinatown no frills but constantly delivers on the essence of what you looking for
the quick lunch special review i love their lunch special i know they turn into a crazy club or boozy brunch spot but the food is actually excellent the details yes its a scene and yes its wildly overpriced which is why i enjoy their restaurant week and course price fix lunch when youre in need of a mid week treat get the salmon with zoodles for entree and the fried oreos for dessert yumthe damage the three course lunch is under is a ton of food
what makes this chinese restaurant unique out of the hundreds and hundreds of chinese restaurants you walk past around every block you can imagine in nyc its authentic not your americanized general tsos chicken and pork fried rice but real chinese food sichuan to be exacti got to try various items on the menu during my visit here a few items that really stood out to mepork rib soup w lotus root would recommend this instead of the usual wonton soup found typically at a chinese restaurant as this is something more authentic pork ribs is something to die for in this dishsome of the appetizers i liked dan dan noodles and sichuan spicy dumplingseggplant with garlic sauce stirred fried eggplant drenched in a garlic sauce which is also a little bit sweet which adds a nice taste to itsauteed string beans if you want a vegetable dish that is not spicy and soaked in sauce id recommend this id get this with pork added to the mix if youre looking to add meat to itspicy aromatic baked whole fish most likely my favorite which has that hint of spicy with a sweet tangy flavor that goes really well together with the fish itself
if youre from new york or just visiting you need to catch a show at radio city the theatre is beautiful and its very big inside what i love about is that its well organized and has the lobby has just enough items up for purchase not too little not too much it is over priced think of movie theater popcorn priceswe go every year to catch the rockettes and my now yo loves to watch the whole christmas story they play we have sat in a variety of seats so i can say if youre with kids sit on the mezzanine mainly because of the way its angled it easier for them to see whats happening orchestra seats are great for adults but not so much for kids the other pit about sitting really close is you dont get to see the whole show in a single view where if youre sitting a little bit higher you can watch the show a little more easily the pit about being higher though is its not as shiney as it is from below the glitter and gold shine a little brighter from orchestra seats also it seems a little more loud from higher up
i had the ultimate pleasure of being gifted tickets to watch one of the first productions of to kill a mockingbird during december the cast is phenomenal including jeff daniels in the lead dakin matthews neal huff and latanya richardson jackson and obviously loaded with talent the theater itself is very user friendly with a bar situated behind the orchestra seats and a clear path to the restrooms and an additional bar in the lower basement area snacks and beverages are available and allowed in the theater in this instance my seats were in orchestra center row d and the view was great im sure the view from the mezzanine was good as well but id stick to the general rule that closer is better here at more than one point during the show the cast will be coming onstage from the audience this is part of the reason that late entries are not permitted and that you cannot reenter if you leave your seat unless its intermission the shubert staff is very helpful and friendly most importantly the staff run a well timed show so everything will start on time facilities are clean modern and create the perfect acoustics for such a show as thisdefinitely go see aaron sorkins to kill a mockingbird and certainly check out the shubert theater
my home away from home i feel safe comfortable and accepted here ive been coming here for years coffee is very good just the way i like it not too strong not too weak the baked goods cant be beat i love the scones and muffins and a cupcake now and then pies and cakes are great the best bagels in manhattan fresh baked daily wide variety of flavors lots of flavors of cream cheese too you all see my photos its a beautiful thing i love the window seating get here early if you want to sit this place us usually full of locals eating chatting or reading their paper or book over a cup of coffee if you want a full meal go to the next corner the corner south of here has their restauranti cant say enough about the employees some have worked here over years they are friendly and professional its a tough environment to work in i quickly dismiss any errors in orders i hear people complain they always get mine correct customers need to understand it takes time to train new employees its a large operation you cant tell by looking at just this bagel shop space the bakery supplies a lot of other business locations in my book they do the best they can under long six day work weeks yes folks only one day off a week they have my support as long as i can fit them in my budget i do without elsewhere this is one of my two or three favorites in my hood i highly recommend
theres been an influx of japanese chain restaurants lately into nyc attempting to capture a new yorkers picky taste buds some have failed pretty miserably so i went into this meal with skeptic thoughts wow was i mistaken one of the top meals ive had in nyc this yearthis is the kind of place where you pay for your meal and you think to yourself wow that was an insane steal as they have just opened two weeks ago they currently only offer their omakase option which is fairly priced at take one look at the menu and you know youll be getting a lot of food they are conveniently available on opentable so be sure to snag a reservation i would suggest sitting at the counter as you are that much closer to the yakitori actionseasonal amuse bouche kinds chickenbone soupthe presentation was beautiful we got edamame mousse with uni not a super smooth mousse but i didnt mind it at all it really allows you to still taste the edamame uni was a great topping spinach and mushroom refreshing chicken liver pate so creamy and a bit sweet wish they toasted the bread though chicken skin not crispy but chewy but not in an offputting way comes in a tangy sauce and the most glorious tiny cup of insanely yummy chicken bone soup i could have cups of this i need to figure out how to make this at homechicken in spicy saucethis reminds me of the chicken slices at totto ramen but even more tender the spicy sauce has a nice kick try to avoid the peppercornsfoie gras chawanmushion par with how much i liked that darn chicken bone soup this dish was genius and amazing the chawanmushi was so lush and smooth best ive had i tried to eat this as slowly as possible so i could really savor the taste and all the aromas it was topped with truffle shavings so its really overload in all the ways you can think of i asked the staff if they replaced foie gras with truffle as i didnt see any they told me that it was blended in the eggmaybe thats why it tasted so decadenthousemade rice bran pickled vegetablesjust ok not very pickled good palate cleansers also came with a small dish of grated radishyakitori all perfectly seasoned before they get to youdakimi breast even though its breast meat its soooo tender its topped with freshly grated wasabimaruhatsu heart grilled to perfection not too mushy and not too tough very fresh as there was no gamey taste at allseseri neck ive actually never had this before and i had no idea i was eating as i wasnt listening when he presented it it had a bit of cartilage crunch in it so i thought it was possibly the knee but it had too much meatskinit was the neck so good im going to order this everytime i go eat yakitori from now on sunagimo gizzard has a nice bite always one of my favorite pieces as i love the texture and the tastefurisode drumette even yummier than the breast meat dark meat this was topped with a pungent spicy red sauce and i think he dipped it in some of sauce while grilling it so goodfried chilled eggplantokracherry tomatoes all really good really simple wish we got some mushrooms thoughtsukune meat balls perfection on a stick these meatballs are soooo tender and flavorful the best part is the little pieces of ground up cartilage in the meatball love the surprise crunch in every bitewagyu super tender and topped with freshly grated wasabi but i actually thought this was slightly too salty other than that the fat in the wagyu tasted pretty gloriousrice or noodlesince i went with my fiance we were able to get one of each the toriko shio ramen and the oyako don i was praying the ramen had the same chicken bone broth and im pretty sure it is but with a touch of yuzu or orange peel i felt like the oyako don could have been a touch sweeter but still really gooddessertthis was a soba cha mousse or panna cotta of some sort with a super tangy yogurt foam i actually enjoyed this but my fiance didnt he said the buckwheat taste was too strong i thought they could lessened how tangy the yogurt foam was but otherwise i liked iti know i know youre probably thinking hey torishin has michelin star and is cheaper i would say youre right but theyre both delicious youd be lucky to have either if youre all about collecting those michelin stars i guess go to torishin first hahai saw a couple next to me get completely different items from what we gotthey seemed to be vegan so its nice to know they can accommodate that before the check they ask you if you want any additional skewers but we were too full for any more and im not sure what they cost no menu yet by the time we were finished the restaurant had really filled up hopefully reservations wont be too hard to get in the future cuz i cant wait to go backlucky anita lo celebrity sighting today at dinner d

found myself a place who reshakes my martini whilst mid drink i feel like a queen you know when youre of the way into a delicious cocktail and it gets warm and weird and youre forced to chug the rest well these guys come around and automatically reshake your martini for you even if youre in the bar area at the high top tables amen to you fine sir or madame for making that a thing dirty martini is bangin wish they offered blue cheese stuffed olives positive it would be a hit with this crowd bar is always packed after no matter what day it is ladies wear a low cut shirt and boom a man offers his seat to you god we are magical service is phenomenal hello and goodbye from the staff every single time if something is not up to par they will remake it andor comp it never happened to me but ive seen it occur once or twice have yet to try the food but i can always see it being prepared from afar open kitchen and then smell the aromas and obviously immediately begin to salivate and therefore publicly embarrassing my date drooling is cool as long as its in a fine establishment such as hillstone and not at a taco bell have some class

this bakery is a great neighborhood spot im unsure if they make everything in house but i know for sure they make all of their breads from scratch the bodegas on the block bug their rolls to make sandwiches because theyre that good personally i love their croissants theyre light buttery and warm straight out of the oven the best part about this bakery are the prices you dont get the pretentious highway robbery of the city or even riverdale for that matter for a freshly made croissant is pretty inexpensive all things consideredthey also sell cakes cookies and other baked goods tortas and mexican rice pudding you can even get freshly made mexican hot cocoa coffee and teas they are a small establishment but what they do they do wellthere are few tables inside as most people order to go on their way to work school or home ive even purchased a croissant from here and brought it to one of the bodegas down the block for an egg cheese im particular with no issue any time im headed to the city for work ill grab a toasted croissant with butter and jelly for the ride downtown and its the bestthe ladies are nice but if youre in a rush you need to let them know because they pander to their regular customers and will complete orders for people who arrive after you
if youre considering doing microblade its important to do your research the best advice i could give what i wish someone told me before i did it would be find someone good be patient and have faith because there are definitely going to be times when you look at your brows and think oh gawd what did i do as you go through the healing process your brows may look way darker and thicker than you want them to but fear not because they will eventually heal and look great see my before after pics thats why its important to find a good place that does quality work like ellebrowi got my eyebrows microbladed by cartoon in late september i did two sessions total the initial session and then a touchup weeks later and i couldnt be happier with how they came outheres how it works make your appointment you can call or reach out to them via facebook messager on their facebook page they respond quickly and are really accommodating fyi at the time i was booking my appointment cartoon was offering special pricing so never hurts to ask initial microblade session be prepared for your first session to take hours the first hour or so is dedicated to completing paperwork followed by pictures and stenciling they sit you in front of studio lights measure and draw the outline of your brows and then you go back and forth to make sure the shape is exactly how you want it a piece of advice feel free to come in with your full face of make up on so they can get a sense of how you like your brows to look just know that for the procedure theyll have to wipe everything off so you may just want to bring makeup remover with you too after the stencil is perfect they apply numbing cream for mins and then get started as others have mentioned youll definitely hear the scratching sound i brought headphones and listened to other things to pass the time i did feel some pain and discomfort but nothing unbearable it was more of a stinging feeling when the ink gets applied immediately after the procedure your brows look really dark thats normal part of that is just the freshness of the ink plus the slight redness cause by the microblading itself mine were also thicker than i was anticipating but they completely thinned out to the desired thickness over the next two weeks healingcare after your session theyll give you a full sheet of instructions for how to care for your brows while they heal be aware that youre supposed to avoid exercisesteam roomsdirect sun exposure for the first days you wash your brows a day with water and baby shampoo apply the provided balm you can shower but dont let the water spray directly on the brows as your brows start to scab up you essentially want to avoid anything that will cause the scabs to dislodge prematurely i started scabbing on day and it took me about days to be fully healed i could already tell touchup three to five weeks after your first session when your eyebrows have fully healed you can decide whether or not you need a touchup the touchup helps fill in any gaps that might exist and addresses any shapethickness issues this is why if youre not sure how thick you like your brows always go thinner because you can add thickness in the touchup session personally i would recommend the touchup especially if you have oily skin which they say can cause the pigment to wear off quicker over time than nonoily skin ive posted photos comparing before vs after the first session vs after the touchup session and you can see a big difference in each step in full disclosure i felt like the touchup session was more painful than the first not sure why and it may just be me i have a pretty high pain tolerance but there were definitely times where i winced so overall it was completely painless if youre really worried i would ask them ahead of time if there are painkillers that are safe to take be aware that some painkills thin your blood and can affect the scabbinghealing process so be sure to check with them first and see what they recommend the healing and care instructions are the same for the touchup session i know a lot of people who did microblading and say that it changes their makeup routine completely because you can literally wake up and go i dont wear makeup ever and it was a gamechanger for me too my facial features just look more defined and i think it was definitely worth the investment ellebrow shares amazing before and after photos from their clients when i was doing my research i was a little worried that their lighting was making it look more flattering than it does in real life i dont think thats the case but just in case others want to see im also sharing my own before and after comparisons
ive been here like times now its that good and im indian i recommend coming for dinner instead of brunch only because the lamb keema at brunch wasnt the same im just going to write out all the dishes ive triedcocktails try the kahwa chai or the kairi mule fav food lamb keema paneer chilli baked chicken black dairy daal cauliflower tandoori mushroom this didnt really taste indian enough for me but it was interesting pepper and onion kulcha paneer bhurji masala omelette personally wasnt my fav potato tikki goat cheese and pea kulcha paneer pinwheels the desserts next time i really want to try the aleppy fish curry nihari and the haleem can they please add mango lassi to the menu or a rasmalai type of dessert again atmosphere and decor is amazing last time i went they played a strange mix of music would recommend hindi or the live musicians that were at brunch thanks

amazing maybe im inherently biased towards the omakase process where the pacing and selection are completely out of your hands and you simply sit back and let the process wash over you for a control freak like me it actually lets me concentrate on the food more ill also add a plug for eating omakase with your hands it makes for a pretty sensual experience that you wouldnt otherwise get with utensils so for kaito i had been looking forward to it for days kaito offers some interesting combinations and flavors think chili olive oil and finger lime as accoutrements with some pink himalayan salt thrown in for good measure but there were also many pieces that would appease a purist with just a dab of wasabi and drizzle of soy sauce the first thing theyll ask is whether you want the or we went with the which comes with a starter plate hand roll miso soup and tomago and two a la carte pieces and walked out pleasantly satiated but not stuffed at the seams do not eat the white stuff at the bottom of the starter plate by the way instead of groundup radish as i had thought it was pure salt and i had a panicked moment where i thought i was going to start hacking uncontrollably the standouts oyster on the starter plate if theres one thing sushi yasaka and kaito do exceptionally well its the oysters i cant tell you whats exactly on them but i will say i could down a platter without any trouble fatty tuno or otoro this was one of the pieces i had to get a repeat of scallop miso soup i grew up on the overly salty miso that came in these dried up little pellets this one tasted homemade ebi tamago i sort of lost track about halfway through because of the deliciousness overload our chef was so friendly thanks for posing with the uni and offered me an extra birthday piece of the tamago

my go to pizzeria in the area everyone has different tastes regarding pizza and not all pizza is created equal clearly the pizza slices here are usually very good it all depends on who makes the slices but sometimes theyre better than other times ive had some bad pizza it is possible but each time here has been good whether the slice is more well done or not they have a lot of options and a sizable menu unless youre ordering something from behind the glass i would recommend calling first if something else on the menu is what you seek some of the specialty slices are great as is some of the rollscalzones ive tried the garlic knots could be better however i do plan on trying more from the menu very soon though i havent been able to since im always on the go there is a decent drink selection and you should be able to find something there are several tables and theyre always cleaned staff is always friendly i sometimes work in the area and this is always my first optionchoice i will of course be back

ive been wanting to try this place for a while and finally decided to make the trek to chelsea one saturday evening there are a few standing tables im not sure how crowded it normally gets but we were able to nab one pizzas are only available by the pie but its perfect for two people because this is only four squares we ordered the sausage pie the sausage was fine nothing too special i appreciated that they didnt skimp on it but the best part of the pizza was the crust now i normally dont care for crusts but this was not your typical crust i think they push the pizza right up to the edge of the pan and then glaze the outer edges with honey or cracki guess youll find me in chelsea more often i now feel obligated to try all of their pies and im not mad at that
the birds bees and angels sang to me the entire hrs i was here ive never been so happy to swipe my card before after eating everything on the menu worth it this place is full of unicorns from the kitchen to the hostess stand heres i walked in and the hostess was singing and dancing to a hit tune happy to see me and seat me i felt like he was a friend from childhood feel good vibes seated and my server pops over also happy to see me and my ppl getting us started with brunch mimosas not really sure of what we wanted we ordered buffalo chicken nachos rightly seasoned with a perfect amount of spice topped with guac the menu called for egg but i didnt want runny egg on my nachos chicken and waffle sliders buttermilk chicken and waffle with the right amount of fluff on the waffle and the chicken was seasoned and flavorful and mm pancakes well these just speak for themselves paired with whip cream there was literally no room at the table but everything was slap ya mama and granny good while touching your soul at the same time the mimosas you get what you pay for unlimited mimosas for mins wild wild wild no better feeling than having brunch and actually getting to enjoy it while not feeling rushed to pay and scram the music whoever controls the music here give them a spotify station horny ram station cleanliness is next to godliness and this place was clean i dropped a good portion of a chicken nacho on the table without thinking twice i scooped it up and into my mouth it went too damn good to let go to waste and they were really clean in here especially the restroom anytime you have u limited mimosas for mins and you manage to keep a ladies room clean youre the real mvpill be back fa sho
kung fu tea and fried chicken together in one place whats not to love i was pretty excited to hear that they were opening up a location in nyc so i had to go check it out definitely wasnt disappointed the tkk wings were crispy and juicy tenders were also delicious had these with a mango green tea and it was an awesome sweet and savory pair not sure if its a good or bad thing for me that this location is only minutes away from work but will definitely be back here soon

been super excited to try this place and totally waiting for summer to try it i finally got to come here after our off broadway show to get dessert for my birthday datethe shop is a long and narrow store where you can walk in and just order the ice cream for the cashier if you want samples you can tell the people at the ice cream scooping area it was a bit confusing you can get one three scoops like normal ice cream or go crazy with a flavor ice cream bouquet and trust me the scoops are pretty big they also have ice cream sandwiches and donut ice cream sandwiches im already overwhelmed with the choices and what do i wanna get to take pictures lolafter absorbing all that you get to choose from so many flavors few that stood out to me were cookie monster royal milk tea thai tea cinnamon toast burnt honey comb and so many more after standing and staring for about awkward minutes while debating my boyfriend and i decided to get two separate desserts and what flavors we wantedboyfriend created his own cruff sandwich with matcha and chocolate ice cream topped with mochimine scoops thai tea black sesame and cinnamon toast crunch on a blue conei dont ever remember getting three scoops of ice cream ever in my life for just myself but i really wanted the stuffed experience i decided that since i live pretty far from the les it was justifiable and boy it was fun interestingeating experience this is definitely something interesting especially with the large amount of ice cream if you decide to get the crazy items for my scooper for some reason my thai tea scoop decided it wanted to slide to the side and just sit there i waited for it to fall ready with a cup but it never did i concluded prob they really are experts at assembling these massive cones after watching someone order a scoop bouquet and eating it without it falling apart totally not stalking cruff looked straight forward but the bf said it was difficult looolthoughts on flavors the thai tea and sesame was delicious and if you love these flavors i would recommend it the cinnamon toast crunch flavor was great as well however off on texture it really was soggy rather than crunchy maybe sprinkling cereal when they serve it would be better the blue cone was yummy overall it is a solid dessert place with loads of flavors to choose and if you ever want to just be extra with your dessert or have friends visiting new york looking for that crazy instagram picture this would be a good choice
with trips planned ahead i decided to come to perfect park driving school to take a couple classes to brush up my driving skill after having not been behind the wheel for over years the staff here are friendly understanding and are always happy to help for first time reservations you have to go into the office choose a plan you want make a payment and schedule a reservation they usually text you a few days before the lesson as a remainder and for any reservations after the first one you can make it in the office or call in for my lesson i made my reservation in the office but didnt pay until a couple days later over the phone because i didnt have enough cash on me and only an american express card i did lessons an hour on the local road and an hour on the highway and they were just enough for me to regain my confidence the instructors for the local roads and the highways are both super helpful encouraging and fun as they teach and give tips and pointers at the end of the lesson you have an opportunity to ask the instructor anything you want like what he thought of your driving and what needs to be improved overall i had a good experience here they accept cash and all major credit cards except for american express

ugly delicious is the best kind of street food the food here definitely delivers but dont come if you just want a gramthe lu wei here tastes is exactly like the ones found in the night markets of taiwan and on the street corners at night you pick the ingredients you want and they braise it in soup to cook it instead of packing the braised food in a little plastic bag to take home they give it to you in a cup here to eatthe portions here are a good size items per person for a regular sized meal you fill out a piece of paper to order the food and drinks each paperseating is super limited you might need to sit outside on the bench

now im not one to line up for trending pastries at celebrity chef outposts but when we were invited to grab breakfast here i was excited for the excuse the breakfast egg sandwiches it must be said are magnificent my italian sandwich with spinach and mozzarella was phenomenal but if you need to pick one the one with the thick slab of bacon on it is a nobrainer that mouthwatering cut of hog meat is breakfast paradiseyou also wont want to leave without trying one of their crullers this seems to be the draw for many patrons these heavenly pastries will set you back and come in flavors including cinnamon and strawberryeverything else from coffee to beer other half is available here is top notch danny meyer does it right
been eyeing this place since they opened and finally gave them a try and i must say i was beyond pleased everything from the service to the food was nothing short of impressive here goesgreeted as soon as we walked in and offered menus the waiter was knowledgeable and very friendly we ordered the shrimp appetizer as well as the baked clams the appetizers came out quickly and upon digging into the clams i was blown away i cant even explain the deliciousness i was sad when i got down to the last one i mean not one bite went without biting into clam meat it was perfectly salty crisp on top garlicky yummymmmmmmmm im obviously having flashbacks which you will understand after trying them lol oh and the shrimp was good too but those claaaaammssssmmmmmm i had the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree and i was happy they actually respected the simplicity of the dish it was seasoned just right the sauce wasnt too sweet the meatballs were the right sizejust an all around great experience dining here i dont want to keep writing about how great the food here is because its hurting mejust put the address in your gps and go send me a thank you later lol
a great play i would probably not listen to the album quite as much as other musicals i could not tell if it was the sound system the actors or just the songs but some of the songs just sounded off the storyline overall was really good it manages to stay new a relevant but does not feel like it will be outdated it surprising that the play is so popular among those that have seen it or know about it but the play does not seem to be widely known
amazing not sure why they have lower ratings but i definitely worth giving stars i was randomly walking though ues and saw this cute restaurant they had a deal for the day i think which was a fixed menu for which includes a bottle of wine salad flatbread and a paella what a deal the owner i believe or gm was so sweet they gave us a free dessert because we originally wanted tiramisu but it ran out the food was amazing loved the ambiance and the service was perfect id definitely would come back here again

i came to this place being utterly confused what happened to hole in the wall then i was told its actually two restaurants sharing the same location during the day its the cool hipster aussie brunch spot and in the night it becomes this trendy intimate asian fusion barrestaurant wow thats pretty weird but cool way to fully utilize pricey nyc real estate they have a pretty small menu but everything we got was extraordinary i was a little skeptical about ordering the roasted veggie dish because from the name to content of the dish it just screams im just boring veggie order me if you dont want to feel guilty about only eating meat but oh my gosh that was the best roasted vegetables i have ever tasted it was out of this world the blend of the spices and the texture of the veggies make them taste meaty satisfying and savoryso good and so unexpectedwe also got the truffle burger honestly i expected it to be good already since it has truffle oil in it but it was also cooked to perfection on top of that i had a drink that was literally lit lit as in on fire and i am not abusing the word literally super creative and the the drink was delicious i am super happy that i can come to one single place in my neighborhood for the entire duration of the day good job whoever is the owner of these two places i was told its the same owner but different chef and staff
loved it visually its so amazingthe props were of course nothing shy from what disney would produce we sat about row from the stage and it was close enoughthe theatres inside are small enough to really anywhere in the orchestra area you have a great viewthey sell candy and popcorn and its minimum each so if you have kids bring your own snacks bc the choices arent good eitherthe genie was the coolest character out of everyone i even thought iago and jafar were awesome theres some things that are different than the movie like theres no abu instead aladdin has side kicks who look more like an aladdin than the actually guy who played him and aladdin himself had a bit of a weird tune when he sung just saying but everyone loved it
amazing beautiful cakes ready to go i had my boyfriends birthday party in less than two hours and hadnt prepared anything was out of town all week found empire cakes on yelp and went in picked a cake and had it personalized in less than five minutes i went for the dulce de leche which was decorated impeccably and tasted even better the frosting was the perfect airiness and flavor without being too sweet and the cake itself was the appropriate level of moist the service at empire was also terrific and so helpful im moving to the area and will definitely be getting more cakes or baked goods here
