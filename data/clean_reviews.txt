talk about wow if anyone ever asked me what my favorite cookie in nyc was its from levains bakery coming from a person who has tried almost every dessert in this city these cookies are out of this world just the right amount of gooeycrisp ratio in every bite when youre finished these cookies will have you on your knees begging for more my favorite would have to be levains chocolate chip walnut cookie even though may be steep to spend on only one cookie youll understand why after just one bite since levains has become such a popular establishment it does get pretty busy i would say avoid weekend lines and go during the morning or a random weekday even if you do end up going during their busy hours it will be worth the wait
mighty quinns is a fastcasual barbecue chain with locations across manhattancalling it the chipotle of bbq isnt quite accurate given how brisk their delivery business seems to be versus takeout but ill take it for the general high quality low price point good enough level that most locations seem to put out the food stands up pretty well to delivery and if youre getting it from the comfort of seamless i predict an average to positive experience but if youre willing to make the trek to east village flagship which apparently makes the food for the other locations you can find some truly standout barbecuei first ventured here via jane ds suggestion to try the ribs these are probably their best tender just short of falloffthebone and not at all greasy the pulled pork is also exceptional a fattier blend than typical resulting in a sloppy and gluttonous sandwich cut with crisp cucumbers and sharp pickled red onionsother meat brisket chicken has been high quality but on the dry side their barbecue sauce isnt anything out of the ordinary but its satisfying and works with all of their options i havent explored the sides too much yet being a small human typically sated with their singleportion meat serving the kale salad is pretty average the sweet potatoes are splendidprices are good i typically spend under here including tax and tip service varies in terms of attitude but its always efficient theres a bathroom with a lock codeoverall i found the meat here to be better than expected given the corporate vibe and mass production a reliable pick for nyc barbecue and an increasing part of my diet

did i just eat the burger in new york city the double stack burger was absolute perfection on a plate it had that umami factor and albeit steep price it just felt so satisfying to bite into itthere was dimension and tons of flavor i loved the sauteed onions the sweet bun and pickles the overall flavor was just very memorable i was eating it unmodified and just the way they usually serve it and it was satisfying and i did not finish it so portion is great for the price at least for mei would love to come back for the pizza and definitely could see myself coming back here in general service was good my only pet peeve was that our group of all ordered burgers and it took a very long time to get all of them out some of us felt too awkward to eat ours it was a corporate lunch and waiting made things soggy
so places like this really do existlike many of us i grew up romanticizing new york i watched saturday night fever and desperately seeking susan and goodfellas and most importantly sex in the city and like many of us was probably far too young for the content at the time i saw a swanky luxurious life filled with unthinkable embellishments then i moved here and realized that theres a thing called rent and another thing called student loans and another thing called taxes and i started to resent carrie bradshaw and her ridiculous and impossible apartment well i digress that world of splendor i pined for with every cell of my being does existalbeit on a different scaleat manhatta it starts from the moment you walk in a wellgroomed host in the lobby leads you to an elevator that makes one stop only floor you float up into paradise into a world where people bring you things you didnt know you wanted and you can pretend for a night that this is the norm now that you while always dine amongst the starsmanhatta has done a magical thing it manages to perfectly package ideal manhattan experience this is a place for a special occasion a sweeping dining room bound by floortoceiling windows that look out on the entire city with a prix fixeonly menu timing is executed perfectly and servers twirl in with your next course just as you start thinking youd like to move to the next thing its seasonal refined american fare with a topnotch mixology program as well we did something very out of the ordinary for me which is drop in to a very popular venue without a reservation i never heed the whole we accept walkins at our bar full dinner menu but this past saturday i the fire in my belly was strong enough as if this place wasnt already magical enough we exited the elevator and found ourselves staring at two empty seats at the bar dream it and believe it friendsperhaps the view wasnt quite as spectacular sitting at the bar but we had an added bonus of watching our bartender fix up some fantastic drinks we both stuck with cocktails here despite the impressive wine list and im glad we did the drink menu changes frequently so sadly i cant report much of what we had but i can speak to two on the current online menu the castle garden gin benedictine honey lime angostura the manhatta new york distilling ragtime rye punt e mes lustau east india sherry bitters both wellexecuted a yummy my favorite drink of the night was a stirred vodka cocktail brand new to the menu i dont like vodka so the idea of a stirred vodka drink sounds awful at first but the bartender convinced me as a fellow vodkadisenthusiast its worth your time we came during valentines day weekend the actual day was so the bar was offering its usual a la carte menu most dishes are totally different than the tasting menu as well as a fourcourse meal for pretty steep considering their threecourser is but the dishes looked so good we couldnt pass it up thats the last time we ball out for a while but it was worth it our eats belowcitrus salad w labneh roasted beets hazelnut alight and refreshing sophisticated an elegant the ideal first course kind of served as an amuse bouche great use of both texture and flavorlobster quenelle w mushrooms roasted lobster emulsion aoh man this is where it started to get decadent i had never heard of this particular lobster preparation before but it was just divine rich and warming lobster twoways is luxurious and comforting very uniquesoft scrambled eggs w uni ai had a similar preparation once at a restaurant in philly which was out of this world so everything else pales in comparison so this didnt blow me away given the reference i had but its still delicious rich and creamy youll want to take a bath in it foie gras amore luxury in the form of liver served with some sort of mustard and maybe some sort of kraut this isnt on the online menu so im doing my best all components meshed wellbites compliments of the kitchen brought out during our first coursechicken liver mousse w everything bagel seasoning a eat this with bread eat this plain delicacy after delicacy will greet you hereoysters acant remember the accompaniments but these were fresh and delicious a nice interlude before the rest of the mealcrescent duck w offal sausage confit endive prunes acooked perfectly a beautiful winter entree rich subtle sweetandsavory melody going on served in some yummy sauce and punctuated with candied nuts and more citruswagyu coulotte w mushrooms celeriac turnips beet jus aanother beautifully seasonal dish excellent cook on the meat i almost never eat red meat but our meal and manhatta proved to be an ideal opportunity to splurge though i do feel ill need a steady diet of veggies and quinoa for the next week as a result
visited yaras based on the recommendation of a friend and im glad i did upon entering we were greeted by a friendly hostess but that was just the beginning of our great experience the next thing that caught our attention was the decor and ambience it was obvious that attention was paid to every detail the place is gorgeousafter being sat we were greeted by a friendly waitress who took our appetizer and drink orders not too long after the chef came to our table to greet us and give us some recommendations for our entrees i ended up choosing the mixed grill platter and my date chose the salmon which was the catch of the day while waiting for our order jacob the owner came by our table to check on how things were going he was very pleasant funny and welcoming our food came out fairly quickly and as soon as we dug into each of our dishes we were blown away by the wonderful flavors their salmon is the best ive ever had in new york yeah i said it it was fn amazing it was so good i suggested that they make it a permanent item on the menu the mixed grill platter was also great but that salmongeeeez both dishes were served with mixed veggies and rice dont forget to ask for a side of toumlebanese garlic sauceyara has great potential and i definitely see it taking off and becoming one of the it spots in the city i cant wait to go back and explore the rest of the menu
look when i first heard about sleep no more i thought that it sounded like a terrible high school art project an interactive version of macbeth with no dialogue where you just roam around the set and wait for things to happen i was wrong this is the best show in nyc and if you are visiting i recommend it immensely and i typically have no truck for avantgarde stuff cant really understand performed dance and am a cultural aesthetic simpleton whose favorite movies are legally blonde and miss congeniality but i was mesmerized by this thing the set design is unreal and so are the performances ive never seen anything like it in the decades to come as ai ascends we will be intensely debating the question what makes humans truly human well let me tell you something its creations like sleep no more testaments to human creativity stretched to their absolute maximum bounds good golly wowthe only thing i suggest to the producers is theyve got to do something about pushy audience members who think its ok to just shove other people aside no this kind of unwanted behavior should be halted by the various black masked security personnel im also going to add that handholding should be banned because it slows down the flow of foot traffic and causes bottlenecks even though they recommend you explore this individually certain couples here cant psychologically afford to let go for even hours i believe there are two things at work alarming codependency or worse the man who feels he has to protect his partner and cant let her go ive seen both and neither bodes well for longterm relationship dynamics
theres something special about their macarons unique flavors and combinations they really are top notch i absolutely love the key lime pie ice cream macaron sandwich which is sweet and tart a piece of heaven in each bite it seems as they always have something new here sweets from wall to wall you really cant go wrong they even have an early grey tea macaron and guess what all of the products sold here is plant based reasonably priced for ny macarons and delectable to boot im a yuge fan and im sure you will be too
the bronx zoo is a great way to spend a wednesday why wednesday because its by donations they also have seasonal events that can be fun for the family and young ones for easter they had an egg scavenger hunt a birdathon coming up in may and a garden event by farm on now in june on top of that they have a theater with built in sensory effects my niece loved it so much the first five minutes and then she fell asleep from fatigue one of her favorite things to do was the bug carousel she choose to ride on top of the firefly now the coolest thing ever that i discovered during my visit was the naturetrek i actually did it with my niece cause im a kid at heart and i did not have this as a child lol the naturetrek was my favorite it was very cool navigating through bridges balancing beams and weaves between obstacles it was very impressive to see how well this was built the bronx zoo also has sea lions and penguins feedings where you can watch them now in the childrens zoo section you can actually feed the animal yourself where you can dispense pellets from a quarter machine to feed the sheep goats and donkeys they also have camel rides from those who want to ride we skip that part we got the total experience and the camel ride was not included but it did include a lot such as the butterfly garden childrens zoo congo gorilla forest jungle world theater bug carousel wild asia monorail and zoo shuttle the prices for an adult is and kids and up overall a very fun experience
cup cup is my new favorite lunch spot in the herald square area okay its a few minutes walk from herald square but close enough ambiancewise its more of a cafe than a restaurant but they serve up some great food and its very affordable you can order a rice or noodle dish for or choose from a combo for a dish a drink less than for a dish a drink over for two dishes a side a drink only downside to this option is that the dishes are prepicked for youive tried the karaage california rice and japanese curry rice bowls and loved them all the portion size is perfect for lunch the karaage bowl was especially filling though the japanese curry one couldve used more curry and croquette relative to the amount of rice if im in a splurgey mood then i usually get an iced green tea latte along with my meal which is also excellentthe baristascashiers are consistently friendly and there is always ample seating available and mellowindie music playing in the background ive never had to wait too long for my food during lunchtime either the longest was probably minutes my only gripe about this place is that theyre cash only but everything comes out to a conveniently even amount etc that even this is only a minor issue overall i highly recommend cup cup for lunch

umami overload i love this place i mean i know its going to be good before hand its pasta and seafood it just have to be good but marea exceeded my already high expectationsi was there for my birthday and did the four course pf menu did i mention this is a michelin two star restaurant and the pf is btw you get a lot of foodi think its really good value considering the food service and the ambience the biggest surprise comes from the raw sliced snapper with caviar sooooo good soooo umami imy pictures are literally crap btw they dont really do the food justice best pasta i have ever eaten in my life period
having been to the fidi location when i used to live down there i was hyped to see this location under construction while walking around work my two coworkers and i visited the second day after they opened for lunch and i am extremely happy to report that the sandwiches here are just as good as i rememberedthe counter attendants were welcoming and cheerful open to giving you their own personal favorites and suggestions if you are overwhelmed by the long list of options we tried the parma prosciutto smoked mozz sundried tomatoes arugula bari salami fresh mozz olive paste sundried tomatoes and trieste proscuitto fresh mozz balsamic dressing arugula and enjoyed all of them you can choose the bread you prefer im a big fan of the focaccia but the ciabatta is also perfection the ingredients are very fresh and high quality and i can die happy after eating the sundried tomato olive paste combo there is also a good selection of vegetarian options and another one of my coworkers tried the capri bufala mozz fresh tomatoes arugula evoo on semolina the verdict was v good sandwich heart buffalo mozz and the semolina is italian chef kissing fingers i was also told to emphasize that you can taste that its real evoo and not some cheap knockoff the sandwich sizes here are absurdly massive ask them to cut your sandwich into so you can save some for a snack dinner alternatively life is too short for regret so choose your own adventure and eat as much as you want in one sitting methere is a credit card minimum but nearly all the sandwiches will allow you to meet that minimum come here but also dont make the line too long kthxbye

we had our team holiday party here and i couldnt have asked for a better experience for our group of we reserved the back room and it was so lovely we had a private bar with plenty of space complete with tons of christmas decorations think christmas tree lights and moving trains theres curtains that separate the rest of the bar from the private room and you also have your own private bathroom too the food mac and cheese we had a bucket of mac and cheese and it wasnt enough so good spinach and artichoke dip also incredible the pita is soft warm and fluffy duck fat fries you cant go wrong with duck fat fries ever sliders the bun was kind of hard but still good chipotle glazed wings really good flavor truffle burrata melt in your mouth good spinach salad brussels sprouts not bad but wasnt a crowd favorite dessert sampler this was so much food tons of ice cream cake cheesecake etcerich was on point with drinks and any other requests we had during the night cant recommend enough
this place just makes me happy who wouldnt like gelato its just a wonderful little gelato shop in chelsea today was a particularly amazing day for it beacuse i dropped in and the weather was warm the service here is always so friendly on top of everything your always greeted with a smile just walking into this place takes you back to childhoodso i got flavors beacuse with so many choices you just cant get one i actually started out with pistachio then thought it was a good idea to add on tiramisu beacuse why wouldnt i then it esculated to hazelnut and a burbon flavor when they asked me if i wanted the little macaroon on top my only reply was pistachio please i sat down and begun to eat as i ate i actually realized that i probably got alittle too much and probably could have opted for a smaller size but you only live once so why not overall i know im right around the corner so ill probably be back until ive managed to try every flavor pluse some its always a great experience ill never go back to regular ice cream again thanks guys
im not a big consumer of food trucks however i do love these guys i used to work around the corner from them and i would hit them up every lunch for my falafel no tomatoes tahini and hot sauce with a diet coke for of all cant beat the price and secondly theyll make the falafel on the spot its always fresh and sooo good never a disappointment fast forward a year later where i havent worked at that store location im a freelance artist and i popped over to grab a bite on the go and my dude totally remembered my order like whatsuper people who work there out in the cold and ny summer heat all day everyday if youre in and around the upper west side stop over get some good food and chill out at lincoln center or central park
we thought we liked our fried fish place down in gun hill now im thinking weve been doing it all wrong but when harbour appeared on the hot new restaurants in mamaroneck you know it was on my list idea came from hubby and suggested we have lunch here mind you we even talked not too long ago about how much white plains and other nearby towns were in dire need of a fried fish placei actually noticed them closed on their yelp page but i googled and called them anyway sure enough person i spoke to over the phone was energetic so we went located a block away from e boston post road and the mamaroneck harbor harbour fish is a fantastic addition to the area quiane her mom and harbours chef hailing from the city island strip are bringing something wayyyyyy different from the typical and bland fish fry places weve all came to enjoy at one time or another especially if you lived in the bx bk qns nyc few things to theyre closed on sundays but given the weather was nice and it was super bowl sunday she wanted to test the waters and see what the foot traffic was like harbour isnt sitdown theyre only take out howeverwas told when weather gets nice there will be some outside seating we were impressed harbour has their friers and counter space on left wall they offer fresh seafood up front followed by more counter space and raw veggies for their steamed or boiled dishes hubby went all in with whiting fried fish sandwichtartar sauce on the side jumbo fried shrimp to share and cod fried fish sandwich sans chipotle mayo for me at this point im like all over harbour and prices are fair i thought after that i just wanted to get home and chow down the food you wanna know shrimp and fish arent just fried quiane and her chef use the perfect amount of a real slamming and seasony dredge on all their fried seafood and it shows they take pride in what theyre putting out and thats fresh seafood and a damn good fish fry everything was very very good and definitely the best fried fish sandwich and seafood ive had in a long time the name says it alli need to make plans to return
i was kind of afraid that this place would be just another solid not outstanding overpriced token ethnic cuisine spot in new york you know what i mean there are so many and most arent really worth checking outi was very pleasantly surprised by mari vanna firstly the interior was gorgeous photos dont do it justice its beautiful slightly kitschy and twee and feels like it might have come out of the manor of a lesser noble in st petersburg ive been the decor is a refreshing change from the standard ultra moderntrendy ambiance of most nyc establishments and is worth the trip aloneluckily the food is delicious as well dinner is probably pricier but at lunch they serve a prix fixe that includes a hefty appetizer and entree which is a great deal we ordered the salmon salad herring yum if you like raw fish chicken stroganoff and beef pelmeni portions and quality were good and quite tasty i confess that i am generally a huge fan of eastern european food meat smoked fish and potatoes whats not to like for lunch i also enjoyed the food and ambiance much more than veselka more of a diner and find both establishments to be similarly priced in which case mari vanna is the clear winneri read some reviews stating that service was bad but during lunch the servers were very friendly and responsiveworth the trip
i would like to review this restaurant as a vegetarian vegan restaurant rather than just a korean restaurant so please consider this when you are thinking about this reservations make a reservation you will have to call into the restaurant to make one but be sure to make the ambiance amazing dark woody balanced with some kind of perfect otherness to it that is for me not easy to describe other than to tell you that i felt so comfortable lose the shoes uyes you will be sitting in a traditional korean dining space with a low table but thankfully there is a recessed cavity for you to put your feet into so you wont have to sit crossed legged for the whole dinner for me that would have been a problem as my legs would have gone to the food amazing vegetarian food with a korean flaira spicy baby dumplings i ate this too fast to figure out what vegetables were in this but they were excellent kind of like a ravioli or a wonton with a unique tasteb combination pancakes which were leek pancakes kimchi mushroom and kabocha pumpkin pancakes all very good the kimchi mushroom was my favoritec todok stone bowl rice i never had todok before but wanted to try this on the recommendation of the waiter todok is a korean mountain root and it was delicious this was to me a unique and tasty bibimbap with the todok root very niced tofu with mixed vegetables my friend ordered this and enjoyed it it does not come with rice separately so you have to order a side of rice to really enjoy thise kimchi stone bowl rice this is also to me like bibimbap in a stone bowl with kimchi excellent what i like most about these stone bowls is that the bowls are so hot that the rice continues to cook and gets that crispy fried texture as if it was on the bottom of a cooked pan tasty great texture and fun to scrape and eat itf avocado stone bowl rice the avocado added a very creamy and rich texture to the meal very nicenot sure why we all ended up with rice bowls i wanted us to try the other items like the mushrooms but the waiter highly recommended the stone bowls and so for some odd reason most of the party ordered itfor dessert we had the chocolate mocha cake with a scoop of soy vanilla ice cream blueberry coconut cake and two mango sorbets excellent and extremely tastyas a vegetarian vegan restaurant the food here is absolutely outstanding the presentation the taste the choice the beauty of the creations are top notch loved it for a korean restaurant since i am not a vegan or vegetarian i did miss the great taste of meats cooked so well but hangawi was a very unique experience that i am so happy to have tried and will try again in the futuregk says check it out especially if your daughter is vegan and is in nyc for the first time

just opened weeks ago today and while rh rooftop enjoyed peace and quiet the words out nowlocated within the jaw dropping new rh in meatpacking on the floor is the gorgeous rh rooftop restaurant decked out in plush seating chandeliers for days and a rooftop with views you need to get here stat like their sister resto in chicago they do not take ressies we arrived just after opening and the place was empty left around and it was still only half full go nowof course besides the aesthetics the food was on point and excellent pricing for the environment i had the divine eggs w creme fraiche served alongside the most decadent and delicious buttered toast friend had the burger and it was massive didnt try it but was told it was excellent hubby got the turkey club which was a very generous portion all the plates come with sides either fries or side salad and lemme tell you fries all the way one of the best fries ive had and im a french fry expert so basically just trust me service was top notch and the bathrooms here oh myyyy dripping in marble and gold the ambiance here is certainly rh worthy and the food was delish to boot would return

by far the best omakase in new york city world renowned sushi chef tatsu is the best in the game in my opinion and thankfully he is in the heart of greenwich village located downstairs le boucherie on christopher street there are only seats and employees and its all they need beware of the brightness of light and i had go back to the terraces to grab sunglasses when we went the first time but if you expect an authentic japanese sushi omakase then this place is perfect no music brightly lit and the theater of sushi you wont believe the service and hospitality i never had an empty glass and returning to my seat at the sushi bar there are no tables my napkin is delicately folded and waiting for me we first went on an anniversary and we were gifted a book about tatsu i wish i had a book about me to give people when they came to my sushi restaurant but i do not have a sushi restaurant nor am i a sushi chef nor do i have a book so i just give people my fake music album on audio compact disc when they bring their own sushi to my standup has mentioned the toothpicks in the bathroom every time we go so dont miss out on that i just cant say enough good things about the sushi so i wont say anything at all for fear of using my entire vocabulary up in one yelp review and not being able to speak in public which is largely what i do for a living for me this is the crown jewel of japanese food in new york city tatsu is humble brilliant inventive and funny his associates are every bit as talented and essential his assistant wont make eye contact much but your eyes will roll back into your head when you taste the miso soup he prepares the best i have ever had the final piece not tamago is something so delicately prepared and delicious that it is at once a delicacy i have never encountered and reminiscent of the nostalgia of a childhood tunafish sandwich i have never had prawn sushi that rivals tatsusat it is expensive but yet a steal plan on paying for additional pieces if you go hungry we usually eat a final hand roll after my second prawn piece as our dessert i plan to come here every week i am in town so ill see you there ill be the one at the end of the bar trying not to fall out of my chair from satiation next to who will be hovering several inches off her seat because of the ambrosia its tatsupreme to the maximumthe original yelp gangstertj miller
this warm bowl of food made your girl so happyhashtag new year resolution but i could not stand another salad from sweetgreen so hello poke hashtag january in nyc and i needed some hot food in my stomach so hello red poke this place has been on my radar for a while and i know they are koreanowned which makes it ultra appealing to me not only because the food must be flavorful by definition but also i have the civil duty to support poc businesses plus i live literally across the streetthe customer service is amazing and the guy running the cash register was super patient and helpful people assembling the bowls were fast and everyone communicated well i got a large with tofu shrimp and salmon and all three proteins tasted fantastic they also have like different sauces to choose from so take that other poke joints the rice both white and brown is extremely moist just as you would expect from our korean fam out there a few things of i would probably not get the japchae again because i find it quite flavorless i guess you are supposed to mix it with a lot of sauce but i didnt dig the rice is kept warm in the rice cooker which is genius especially for the winter but it means that the white rice is not sushi rice with vinegar and all they forgot to give me kimchi which you have to pay extra for nonetheless i was satiated because they give you a healthy amount of each topping you the supergreens is really just spinach at least on my the avocado is stored as a mash in a container instead of being scooped out to order not necessarily a bad thing because ive seen some darn black avocado halves at salad joints just as an fyito be fair my experience was really a but my delicious bowl got my hopes up and i am convinced this place might actually be perfect i cannot wait to try their dumplings and sides and fully stamp my loyalty card
what an epic meal the theme here is enjoy the whole space has that warm spacious brewerystyle feeling that only comes from the midwest where this spot hails from these two dishes are the incredible the fried chicken packed with ginger and crunchy sesame in a korean sauce my surprising favorite divine their signature cheeseburger with bacon and egg oozing with yolk and thickcut bacon all the food here is so well balanced theyre working with hugely flavorful foods and somehow combining them into something harmonious and not too salted or too cheesy or too this or that such a feat we happened to unknowingly sit next to brandon the sous chef at the counter and he offered us a free dish of bone marrow piled high and with their warm beef cheek jam wowsa was this delicious brandon was so kind and generous and filled us in on how excited they are to finally open the doors to their nyc location our server jorge was also great and welcoming and urged us to take our time and stars
kenscale this time of the year i usually have one or two favorite restaurants in nyc in my mind my annual review will come out shortly thus far has been a strange year in that regard it was quite difficult to pinpoint any memorable moments throughout the culinary journey with my wife jun until my recent birthday dinner with my wife jun anyone who follows my reviews will know that as a native korean i can be pretty difficult to please when it comes to korean restaurants in the city after much deliberation on where i will celebrate my birthday with jun i ultimately decided on atomix and purchased tickets for two at per person it turned out that atomix is the best korean restaurant i had been to in new york city it also turned out that atomix is the best new restaurant in nyc that i had visited this year what distinguishes atomix from other finedining tasting menu places is the efforts that the restaurant has put into explaining the background behind each dish in its tencourse offering i have never come across a restaurant that has a flashcard describing the inspiration for each dish and this narrative element greatly adds to the tasting experience itself and each dish actually delivered with such astounding elegance lets start out with guk soup in korean with the maesaengi seaweed in the pork broth along with garlic custard and sea urchin from hokkaido the soup became one harmonious bowl that was aromatic and delicious atomixs brilliance lies in the way the kitchen uses unexpected ingredients in the way i had not expected in korean cuisine such as carrot that was fermented to give yellow sashimi hwe such a refreshing kick as described in the flashcard potato pancake jeon has not been considered peasant food given the low place of potato in the grain hierarchy of korean tradition but atomix has found a way to elevate it into a beautiful slice with ricotta cheese and a variety of flower and herb that was also delightfully crispy other dishes such as steamed snow crab jjim with white kimchi sauce pickled grenada pepper and smoked trout roe fried twigim soondae and a tart of celeriac buttermilk cheese hazelnut milk and caviar sukchae similarly displayed ingenuity and thoughtful execution our two best savory dishes came at the end the grilled gui golden eye snapper that came with kohlrabi compressed with white kimchi juice and nuruk a traditional fermentation starter sauce using snapper fish stock was so delicious that i had a hard time thinking of any other fish dish i had at a restaurant recently that was just as memorable similarly the braised jorim wagyu was a marvelous perfection in texture you will see an assortment of rice and lettuce with which you can make small wraps along with this beautiful meat accompanied by fermented red pepper each bite of wrap was just blissful and my only regret was that there were only four pieces of meat he two desserts that came out were also fascinating i didnt expect to see ice cream made of makgeolli but it sure was a delightful palate cleanser ipgasim and i began to wonder why other restaurants have not thought of using this popular rice wine for desserts the main dessert husik consisting of red bean cr√®me fraiche persimmon and pine nut drew influence from winter solstice on which koreans eat red bean porridge patjuk and beautifully captured the modern interpretation of patjuk with the addition of persimmon that was aged with soju another popular korean liquor then roasted to give a smooth texture as noted above reservations at atomix can only be secured through ticket purchases one for pm and the other for pm each day online available at tock the intimate single chefs counter setting at the restaurant gives a modern yet unpretentious feel that is another positive contributor to the dining experience occasionally chef park comes out to serve a dish himself and his wife ms park walks around the counter making sure all the diners are properly attended to there is full bar with cocktails inspired by modern korean flavors and ingredients as well as a wine list mostly from france italy and us at the end of our meal jun and i took a photo with chef park and briefly spoke to ms park who noted that the menu changes every quarter thereby giving me a revelation that jun and i should visit this place whenever the menu is revamped so we so we get to see what kind of magic chef parks kitchen brings forward while also as a fellow native korean hopefully giving more moral support to this mildmannered yet ambitious korean couple in fact while our culinary journey has been mostly checking out new restaurants as they open we have decided that we will pick a few goto restaurants that we will want to visit more than twice every year atomix will be the first restaurant on that list

we were at blue note back in september to see chick coreas trio perform up close and actually quite intimate as we were seated right next to the stage and chicks piano it was a memorable experience to say the leastchick corea on piano carlito de puerto on bass and marcus gilmore on drums as for the venue i can only remember the space is very close tables are tight as are most new york jazz clubs besides lincoln center i dont remember ordering food most likely drinks all i remember is chick corea and his band as we enjoyed a great rare performance dthey do have a menu of a variety of bar food appetizers entr√©es including filet mignon plus sandwiches burgers etc our cover charge was high but i believe the average is bar seats and for tables depending on the artist of course food and drinks are extra
if youve seen the television show series you on lifetime or bingewatched on netflix the exterior of this upper east side bookstore was filmed to portray mooneys bookstore the interior looks different since the interior of mooneys was filmed on a set in the bronx so you wont be seeing a glass box in the basement etchowever you will find a friendly cat named mr boo boo if you pet him long enough he may purr himself to sleep the staff here are very friendly and this is my favorite bookstore in the neighborhood they offer gift wrapping for any books and sell other items such as a fine assortment of greeting cards childrens books accompanied with puppetstoysstuffed animals and bookmarkstheres a couple boxes of used books not on the shelves where the price ranges are from hope you get to visit this friendly bookstore take home a nice book or two
delicious pastries and scones for the afternoon tea it was packed on a monday afternoon so definitely get reservations we ordered tea for plus lobster mac n cheese from the regular menu and shared between people we especially loved the curry chicken sandwich and the lemon tart the mac n cheese was to die for and definitely the best part of the meal great service too

what a way to start the new year waitress was awesome its definitely in my top of broadway shows out of about the music was like a symphony to my ears it was so beautiful this show created a wave of emotions in me i laughed cried wanted to get married get pregnant have an affair with my gynecologist and get a divorce all at the same time lol it was hilarious but it did touch on alot of real world issues like infidelity and emotional physical abuse the worst kinds of relationships are the ones youre least happy in the cast was spectacular and i cant wait to listen to the soundtrack happy
this place excels in all aspects from decor to service to food we had a bit of a wait when we came but since they take your number to text you when your tables ready it was fine we just went and walked around a bitwe were sat in the front in the section with tables before the bar our server was super attentive without being overbearing the decor is very elegant and calm and the noise level isnt too bad the food is the main attraction though i had the sansai mountain vegetables udon and my boyfriend had the tantanmen my sansai udon was clean and delicious very light yet flavorful my boyfriends tantanmen was spicy and deep and i might get that one next time both dishes were absolutely standout we also had the kinpira gobo which tasted just like i was back in japan i loved it and my boyfriend did too i will definitely be back here to try out some other dishes on the menu highly recommend
a extremely beautiful cemetery especially now with the beautiful foliage i want to thank the wonderful people at woolawn cemetery mslori locke family service counselor for making a difficult time a bit soothing and less stressful and the hugs helped also this week i got the phone call that my fathers tombstone was ready and i got to visit him on this beautiful fall day
the play the lifespan if a fact wdaniel radcliffeabout a demanding editor cherry jones a determined young fact checker daniel radcliffe and author bobby carnevale working on an essay that is to be published it was funny relatable and very relevant to the modern world especially as a young professional i can empathize and identify with daniel radcliffes characterthe transitions between scenes were great the person cast was amazing love the sets studio was a very intimate little theatre it was very easy to find our seats people are right that it isnt really staggering i found myself swaying back and forth depending on the person in front of me however the view was great besides that
emscuplt where athletics meets aesthetics i discovered dr neinstein when i came across emsculpt hes one of the very first doctors in nyc to implement emsculpt in his practice a noninvasive nonsurgical procedure that effortlessly builds muscles in your abs and butt the machine is fdaapproved and it is safe it claims to do about situps for you in minutes time resulting in about increase in muscle and decrease in fat in the abdominal regioni signed up for the emscuplt ab sessions which consist of sessions in a week period with days in between sessions each session lasted for minutes i was able to go to yoga and kickboxing after each session easily theres two paddles so you can bring a friend to do an ab session together the wait varies for my first appointment i was scheduled for but did not get called in until almost an hour later for my appointment i did not get in until about half hour later there was no wait for my and sessionsis it worth it totally but also depends on your lifestyle i would say go for the ab sessions if you work out consistently and have a bmi in the lower overall i really like the result
the cabin is the ultimate form of hygge that you can find in nyc with its woody interior and a literal tree lit with tiny fairy lightbrings much needed warmth in this brutal winter weather its an escape from cold wind and treating yourself to amazing cocktails with top shelf liquor i had a mountain mojito which had this crispiness from citrus cutting into any harshness of the alcohol which is how i like my cocktails they need to be well balanced and beautifully crafted the bartender are knowledgeable in their craft of making amazing drinks also the brussels sprouts were to die for amazing crispiness and slight sweet caramelization formed on the edges of the sprouts were divine definitely worth the price they do have a patio in development and i cant wait for itwill be coming back soon to try the mule next

meat nothing says korean bbq quite like a gigantic platter of freshly cooked meat im not much of a carnivore but i just had to make an exception the food was great service was excellent and the quality of everything was just mmmm so good prices are also what i would expect for this type of establishment kbbq is typically on the side but well worth it if you ask meif you like meat and good times you wont be disappointed
a great museum composed of many exhibits with lots of displays and great information with multiple floors large halls and additional exhibits that change occasionally theres a lot to see from the stars to the deep depths of the ocean youll end up walking quite a bit so wear comfy shoes food is pricey as are their souvenirs but thats new york for you the general admission which is pay what you want at the door will only allow you access to the main halls and attractions but the add on exhibits require additional tickets to be purchased before you can access those areas it is a very educational and kid friendly place to visit
i was hesitant about coming here due to their reviews but i had a great experience i think what makes this place a bit off for others is the fact that their menu changes every three months and the items on the menu are eccentric for example ive never had tuna sashimi with bacon bits it was strange but still very tasty the overall vibe here is eccentric i definitely recommend making reservationsthe staff was sweet and informative and the food was very fresh i would certainly return here
amy gross is a seasoned professional and a great teacher shes like that tough but funny teacher you had in junior high whom everyone respects and fears ever so slightly that you never forget amy manages class time very efficiently spending the first half on the handson baby cpr and heimlich techniques the second half of class on various safety tips then reinforcing the first part again before you leavehighly recommended for anyone looking to gain some confidence and peace of mind for basic infant first aid
wonderful lunch special course for starter main and dessert considering mains are around this is a great price really nice staff who are quite attentive we were a big group on a quiet day so they were nice and gave us free plates of appetizers veggie and meat samosas personally i picked lamb as a starter and main and then the kulfi ice cream for dessert next time id like to try the fig firni dessert rice custard lunch only has dessert choices btw presentation is really nice for everything but especially the rice fig firni
this is chinatown at its finest great food at super affordable price roast duck is a must try i wish i work closer to here so i can come for a cheap yet satisfying lunch everyday everything here is good meat is always tender flavorful and juicy its pretty much a hole in a wall but i love it its like the spirit of chinatown no frills but constantly delivers on the essence of what you looking for
the quick lunch special review i love their lunch special i know they turn into a crazy club or boozy brunch spot but the food is actually excellent the details yes its a scene and yes its wildly overpriced which is why i enjoy their restaurant week and course price fix lunch when youre in need of a mid week treat get the salmon with zoodles for entree and the fried oreos for dessert yumthe damage the three course lunch is under is a ton of food
what makes this chinese restaurant unique out of the hundreds and hundreds of chinese restaurants you walk past around every block you can imagine in nyc its authentic not your americanized general tsos chicken and pork fried rice but real chinese food sichuan to be exacti got to try various items on the menu during my visit here a few items that really stood out to mepork rib soup w lotus root would recommend this instead of the usual wonton soup found typically at a chinese restaurant as this is something more authentic pork ribs is something to die for in this dishsome of the appetizers i liked dan dan noodles and sichuan spicy dumplingseggplant with garlic sauce stirred fried eggplant drenched in a garlic sauce which is also a little bit sweet which adds a nice taste to itsauteed string beans if you want a vegetable dish that is not spicy and soaked in sauce id recommend this id get this with pork added to the mix if youre looking to add meat to itspicy aromatic baked whole fish most likely my favorite which has that hint of spicy with a sweet tangy flavor that goes really well together with the fish itself
if youre from new york or just visiting you need to catch a show at radio city the theatre is beautiful and its very big inside what i love about is that its well organized and has the lobby has just enough items up for purchase not too little not too much it is over priced think of movie theater popcorn priceswe go every year to catch the rockettes and my now yo loves to watch the whole christmas story they play we have sat in a variety of seats so i can say if youre with kids sit on the mezzanine mainly because of the way its angled it easier for them to see whats happening orchestra seats are great for adults but not so much for kids the other pit about sitting really close is you dont get to see the whole show in a single view where if youre sitting a little bit higher you can watch the show a little more easily the pit about being higher though is its not as shiney as it is from below the glitter and gold shine a little brighter from orchestra seats also it seems a little more loud from higher up
i had the ultimate pleasure of being gifted tickets to watch one of the first productions of to kill a mockingbird during december the cast is phenomenal including jeff daniels in the lead dakin matthews neal huff and latanya richardson jackson and obviously loaded with talent the theater itself is very user friendly with a bar situated behind the orchestra seats and a clear path to the restrooms and an additional bar in the lower basement area snacks and beverages are available and allowed in the theater in this instance my seats were in orchestra center row d and the view was great im sure the view from the mezzanine was good as well but id stick to the general rule that closer is better here at more than one point during the show the cast will be coming onstage from the audience this is part of the reason that late entries are not permitted and that you cannot reenter if you leave your seat unless its intermission the shubert staff is very helpful and friendly most importantly the staff run a well timed show so everything will start on time facilities are clean modern and create the perfect acoustics for such a show as thisdefinitely go see aaron sorkins to kill a mockingbird and certainly check out the shubert theater
my home away from home i feel safe comfortable and accepted here ive been coming here for years coffee is very good just the way i like it not too strong not too weak the baked goods cant be beat i love the scones and muffins and a cupcake now and then pies and cakes are great the best bagels in manhattan fresh baked daily wide variety of flavors lots of flavors of cream cheese too you all see my photos its a beautiful thing i love the window seating get here early if you want to sit this place us usually full of locals eating chatting or reading their paper or book over a cup of coffee if you want a full meal go to the next corner the corner south of here has their restauranti cant say enough about the employees some have worked here over years they are friendly and professional its a tough environment to work in i quickly dismiss any errors in orders i hear people complain they always get mine correct customers need to understand it takes time to train new employees its a large operation you cant tell by looking at just this bagel shop space the bakery supplies a lot of other business locations in my book they do the best they can under long six day work weeks yes folks only one day off a week they have my support as long as i can fit them in my budget i do without elsewhere this is one of my two or three favorites in my hood i highly recommend
theres been an influx of japanese chain restaurants lately into nyc attempting to capture a new yorkers picky taste buds some have failed pretty miserably so i went into this meal with skeptic thoughts wow was i mistaken one of the top meals ive had in nyc this yearthis is the kind of place where you pay for your meal and you think to yourself wow that was an insane steal as they have just opened two weeks ago they currently only offer their omakase option which is fairly priced at take one look at the menu and you know youll be getting a lot of food they are conveniently available on opentable so be sure to snag a reservation i would suggest sitting at the counter as you are that much closer to the yakitori actionseasonal amuse bouche kinds chickenbone soupthe presentation was beautiful we got edamame mousse with uni not a super smooth mousse but i didnt mind it at all it really allows you to still taste the edamame uni was a great topping spinach and mushroom refreshing chicken liver pate so creamy and a bit sweet wish they toasted the bread though chicken skin not crispy but chewy but not in an offputting way comes in a tangy sauce and the most glorious tiny cup of insanely yummy chicken bone soup i could have cups of this i need to figure out how to make this at homechicken in spicy saucethis reminds me of the chicken slices at totto ramen but even more tender the spicy sauce has a nice kick try to avoid the peppercornsfoie gras chawanmushion par with how much i liked that darn chicken bone soup this dish was genius and amazing the chawanmushi was so lush and smooth best ive had i tried to eat this as slowly as possible so i could really savor the taste and all the aromas it was topped with truffle shavings so its really overload in all the ways you can think of i asked the staff if they replaced foie gras with truffle as i didnt see any they told me that it was blended in the eggmaybe thats why it tasted so decadenthousemade rice bran pickled vegetablesjust ok not very pickled good palate cleansers also came with a small dish of grated radishyakitori all perfectly seasoned before they get to youdakimi breast even though its breast meat its soooo tender its topped with freshly grated wasabimaruhatsu heart grilled to perfection not too mushy and not too tough very fresh as there was no gamey taste at allseseri neck ive actually never had this before and i had no idea i was eating as i wasnt listening when he presented it it had a bit of cartilage crunch in it so i thought it was possibly the knee but it had too much meatskinit was the neck so good im going to order this everytime i go eat yakitori from now on sunagimo gizzard has a nice bite always one of my favorite pieces as i love the texture and the tastefurisode drumette even yummier than the breast meat dark meat this was topped with a pungent spicy red sauce and i think he dipped it in some of sauce while grilling it so goodfried chilled eggplantokracherry tomatoes all really good really simple wish we got some mushrooms thoughtsukune meat balls perfection on a stick these meatballs are soooo tender and flavorful the best part is the little pieces of ground up cartilage in the meatball love the surprise crunch in every bitewagyu super tender and topped with freshly grated wasabi but i actually thought this was slightly too salty other than that the fat in the wagyu tasted pretty gloriousrice or noodlesince i went with my fiance we were able to get one of each the toriko shio ramen and the oyako don i was praying the ramen had the same chicken bone broth and im pretty sure it is but with a touch of yuzu or orange peel i felt like the oyako don could have been a touch sweeter but still really gooddessertthis was a soba cha mousse or panna cotta of some sort with a super tangy yogurt foam i actually enjoyed this but my fiance didnt he said the buckwheat taste was too strong i thought they could lessened how tangy the yogurt foam was but otherwise i liked iti know i know youre probably thinking hey torishin has michelin star and is cheaper i would say youre right but theyre both delicious youd be lucky to have either if youre all about collecting those michelin stars i guess go to torishin first hahai saw a couple next to me get completely different items from what we gotthey seemed to be vegan so its nice to know they can accommodate that before the check they ask you if you want any additional skewers but we were too full for any more and im not sure what they cost no menu yet by the time we were finished the restaurant had really filled up hopefully reservations wont be too hard to get in the future cuz i cant wait to go backlucky anita lo celebrity sighting today at dinner d

found myself a place who reshakes my martini whilst mid drink i feel like a queen you know when youre of the way into a delicious cocktail and it gets warm and weird and youre forced to chug the rest well these guys come around and automatically reshake your martini for you even if youre in the bar area at the high top tables amen to you fine sir or madame for making that a thing dirty martini is bangin wish they offered blue cheese stuffed olives positive it would be a hit with this crowd bar is always packed after no matter what day it is ladies wear a low cut shirt and boom a man offers his seat to you god we are magical service is phenomenal hello and goodbye from the staff every single time if something is not up to par they will remake it andor comp it never happened to me but ive seen it occur once or twice have yet to try the food but i can always see it being prepared from afar open kitchen and then smell the aromas and obviously immediately begin to salivate and therefore publicly embarrassing my date drooling is cool as long as its in a fine establishment such as hillstone and not at a taco bell have some class

this bakery is a great neighborhood spot im unsure if they make everything in house but i know for sure they make all of their breads from scratch the bodegas on the block bug their rolls to make sandwiches because theyre that good personally i love their croissants theyre light buttery and warm straight out of the oven the best part about this bakery are the prices you dont get the pretentious highway robbery of the city or even riverdale for that matter for a freshly made croissant is pretty inexpensive all things consideredthey also sell cakes cookies and other baked goods tortas and mexican rice pudding you can even get freshly made mexican hot cocoa coffee and teas they are a small establishment but what they do they do wellthere are few tables inside as most people order to go on their way to work school or home ive even purchased a croissant from here and brought it to one of the bodegas down the block for an egg cheese im particular with no issue any time im headed to the city for work ill grab a toasted croissant with butter and jelly for the ride downtown and its the bestthe ladies are nice but if youre in a rush you need to let them know because they pander to their regular customers and will complete orders for people who arrive after you
if youre considering doing microblade its important to do your research the best advice i could give what i wish someone told me before i did it would be find someone good be patient and have faith because there are definitely going to be times when you look at your brows and think oh gawd what did i do as you go through the healing process your brows may look way darker and thicker than you want them to but fear not because they will eventually heal and look great see my before after pics thats why its important to find a good place that does quality work like ellebrowi got my eyebrows microbladed by cartoon in late september i did two sessions total the initial session and then a touchup weeks later and i couldnt be happier with how they came outheres how it works make your appointment you can call or reach out to them via facebook messager on their facebook page they respond quickly and are really accommodating fyi at the time i was booking my appointment cartoon was offering special pricing so never hurts to ask initial microblade session be prepared for your first session to take hours the first hour or so is dedicated to completing paperwork followed by pictures and stenciling they sit you in front of studio lights measure and draw the outline of your brows and then you go back and forth to make sure the shape is exactly how you want it a piece of advice feel free to come in with your full face of make up on so they can get a sense of how you like your brows to look just know that for the procedure theyll have to wipe everything off so you may just want to bring makeup remover with you too after the stencil is perfect they apply numbing cream for mins and then get started as others have mentioned youll definitely hear the scratching sound i brought headphones and listened to other things to pass the time i did feel some pain and discomfort but nothing unbearable it was more of a stinging feeling when the ink gets applied immediately after the procedure your brows look really dark thats normal part of that is just the freshness of the ink plus the slight redness cause by the microblading itself mine were also thicker than i was anticipating but they completely thinned out to the desired thickness over the next two weeks healingcare after your session theyll give you a full sheet of instructions for how to care for your brows while they heal be aware that youre supposed to avoid exercisesteam roomsdirect sun exposure for the first days you wash your brows a day with water and baby shampoo apply the provided balm you can shower but dont let the water spray directly on the brows as your brows start to scab up you essentially want to avoid anything that will cause the scabs to dislodge prematurely i started scabbing on day and it took me about days to be fully healed i could already tell touchup three to five weeks after your first session when your eyebrows have fully healed you can decide whether or not you need a touchup the touchup helps fill in any gaps that might exist and addresses any shapethickness issues this is why if youre not sure how thick you like your brows always go thinner because you can add thickness in the touchup session personally i would recommend the touchup especially if you have oily skin which they say can cause the pigment to wear off quicker over time than nonoily skin ive posted photos comparing before vs after the first session vs after the touchup session and you can see a big difference in each step in full disclosure i felt like the touchup session was more painful than the first not sure why and it may just be me i have a pretty high pain tolerance but there were definitely times where i winced so overall it was completely painless if youre really worried i would ask them ahead of time if there are painkillers that are safe to take be aware that some painkills thin your blood and can affect the scabbinghealing process so be sure to check with them first and see what they recommend the healing and care instructions are the same for the touchup session i know a lot of people who did microblading and say that it changes their makeup routine completely because you can literally wake up and go i dont wear makeup ever and it was a gamechanger for me too my facial features just look more defined and i think it was definitely worth the investment ellebrow shares amazing before and after photos from their clients when i was doing my research i was a little worried that their lighting was making it look more flattering than it does in real life i dont think thats the case but just in case others want to see im also sharing my own before and after comparisons
ive been here like times now its that good and im indian i recommend coming for dinner instead of brunch only because the lamb keema at brunch wasnt the same im just going to write out all the dishes ive triedcocktails try the kahwa chai or the kairi mule fav food lamb keema paneer chilli baked chicken black dairy daal cauliflower tandoori mushroom this didnt really taste indian enough for me but it was interesting pepper and onion kulcha paneer bhurji masala omelette personally wasnt my fav potato tikki goat cheese and pea kulcha paneer pinwheels the desserts next time i really want to try the aleppy fish curry nihari and the haleem can they please add mango lassi to the menu or a rasmalai type of dessert again atmosphere and decor is amazing last time i went they played a strange mix of music would recommend hindi or the live musicians that were at brunch thanks

amazing maybe im inherently biased towards the omakase process where the pacing and selection are completely out of your hands and you simply sit back and let the process wash over you for a control freak like me it actually lets me concentrate on the food more ill also add a plug for eating omakase with your hands it makes for a pretty sensual experience that you wouldnt otherwise get with utensils so for kaito i had been looking forward to it for days kaito offers some interesting combinations and flavors think chili olive oil and finger lime as accoutrements with some pink himalayan salt thrown in for good measure but there were also many pieces that would appease a purist with just a dab of wasabi and drizzle of soy sauce the first thing theyll ask is whether you want the or we went with the which comes with a starter plate hand roll miso soup and tomago and two a la carte pieces and walked out pleasantly satiated but not stuffed at the seams do not eat the white stuff at the bottom of the starter plate by the way instead of groundup radish as i had thought it was pure salt and i had a panicked moment where i thought i was going to start hacking uncontrollably the standouts oyster on the starter plate if theres one thing sushi yasaka and kaito do exceptionally well its the oysters i cant tell you whats exactly on them but i will say i could down a platter without any trouble fatty tuno or otoro this was one of the pieces i had to get a repeat of scallop miso soup i grew up on the overly salty miso that came in these dried up little pellets this one tasted homemade ebi tamago i sort of lost track about halfway through because of the deliciousness overload our chef was so friendly thanks for posing with the uni and offered me an extra birthday piece of the tamago

my go to pizzeria in the area everyone has different tastes regarding pizza and not all pizza is created equal clearly the pizza slices here are usually very good it all depends on who makes the slices but sometimes theyre better than other times ive had some bad pizza it is possible but each time here has been good whether the slice is more well done or not they have a lot of options and a sizable menu unless youre ordering something from behind the glass i would recommend calling first if something else on the menu is what you seek some of the specialty slices are great as is some of the rollscalzones ive tried the garlic knots could be better however i do plan on trying more from the menu very soon though i havent been able to since im always on the go there is a decent drink selection and you should be able to find something there are several tables and theyre always cleaned staff is always friendly i sometimes work in the area and this is always my first optionchoice i will of course be back

ive been wanting to try this place for a while and finally decided to make the trek to chelsea one saturday evening there are a few standing tables im not sure how crowded it normally gets but we were able to nab one pizzas are only available by the pie but its perfect for two people because this is only four squares we ordered the sausage pie the sausage was fine nothing too special i appreciated that they didnt skimp on it but the best part of the pizza was the crust now i normally dont care for crusts but this was not your typical crust i think they push the pizza right up to the edge of the pan and then glaze the outer edges with honey or cracki guess youll find me in chelsea more often i now feel obligated to try all of their pies and im not mad at that
the birds bees and angels sang to me the entire hrs i was here ive never been so happy to swipe my card before after eating everything on the menu worth it this place is full of unicorns from the kitchen to the hostess stand heres i walked in and the hostess was singing and dancing to a hit tune happy to see me and seat me i felt like he was a friend from childhood feel good vibes seated and my server pops over also happy to see me and my ppl getting us started with brunch mimosas not really sure of what we wanted we ordered buffalo chicken nachos rightly seasoned with a perfect amount of spice topped with guac the menu called for egg but i didnt want runny egg on my nachos chicken and waffle sliders buttermilk chicken and waffle with the right amount of fluff on the waffle and the chicken was seasoned and flavorful and mm pancakes well these just speak for themselves paired with whip cream there was literally no room at the table but everything was slap ya mama and granny good while touching your soul at the same time the mimosas you get what you pay for unlimited mimosas for mins wild wild wild no better feeling than having brunch and actually getting to enjoy it while not feeling rushed to pay and scram the music whoever controls the music here give them a spotify station horny ram station cleanliness is next to godliness and this place was clean i dropped a good portion of a chicken nacho on the table without thinking twice i scooped it up and into my mouth it went too damn good to let go to waste and they were really clean in here especially the restroom anytime you have u limited mimosas for mins and you manage to keep a ladies room clean youre the real mvpill be back fa sho
kung fu tea and fried chicken together in one place whats not to love i was pretty excited to hear that they were opening up a location in nyc so i had to go check it out definitely wasnt disappointed the tkk wings were crispy and juicy tenders were also delicious had these with a mango green tea and it was an awesome sweet and savory pair not sure if its a good or bad thing for me that this location is only minutes away from work but will definitely be back here soon

been super excited to try this place and totally waiting for summer to try it i finally got to come here after our off broadway show to get dessert for my birthday datethe shop is a long and narrow store where you can walk in and just order the ice cream for the cashier if you want samples you can tell the people at the ice cream scooping area it was a bit confusing you can get one three scoops like normal ice cream or go crazy with a flavor ice cream bouquet and trust me the scoops are pretty big they also have ice cream sandwiches and donut ice cream sandwiches im already overwhelmed with the choices and what do i wanna get to take pictures lolafter absorbing all that you get to choose from so many flavors few that stood out to me were cookie monster royal milk tea thai tea cinnamon toast burnt honey comb and so many more after standing and staring for about awkward minutes while debating my boyfriend and i decided to get two separate desserts and what flavors we wantedboyfriend created his own cruff sandwich with matcha and chocolate ice cream topped with mochimine scoops thai tea black sesame and cinnamon toast crunch on a blue conei dont ever remember getting three scoops of ice cream ever in my life for just myself but i really wanted the stuffed experience i decided that since i live pretty far from the les it was justifiable and boy it was fun interestingeating experience this is definitely something interesting especially with the large amount of ice cream if you decide to get the crazy items for my scooper for some reason my thai tea scoop decided it wanted to slide to the side and just sit there i waited for it to fall ready with a cup but it never did i concluded prob they really are experts at assembling these massive cones after watching someone order a scoop bouquet and eating it without it falling apart totally not stalking cruff looked straight forward but the bf said it was difficult looolthoughts on flavors the thai tea and sesame was delicious and if you love these flavors i would recommend it the cinnamon toast crunch flavor was great as well however off on texture it really was soggy rather than crunchy maybe sprinkling cereal when they serve it would be better the blue cone was yummy overall it is a solid dessert place with loads of flavors to choose and if you ever want to just be extra with your dessert or have friends visiting new york looking for that crazy instagram picture this would be a good choice
with trips planned ahead i decided to come to perfect park driving school to take a couple classes to brush up my driving skill after having not been behind the wheel for over years the staff here are friendly understanding and are always happy to help for first time reservations you have to go into the office choose a plan you want make a payment and schedule a reservation they usually text you a few days before the lesson as a remainder and for any reservations after the first one you can make it in the office or call in for my lesson i made my reservation in the office but didnt pay until a couple days later over the phone because i didnt have enough cash on me and only an american express card i did lessons an hour on the local road and an hour on the highway and they were just enough for me to regain my confidence the instructors for the local roads and the highways are both super helpful encouraging and fun as they teach and give tips and pointers at the end of the lesson you have an opportunity to ask the instructor anything you want like what he thought of your driving and what needs to be improved overall i had a good experience here they accept cash and all major credit cards except for american express

ugly delicious is the best kind of street food the food here definitely delivers but dont come if you just want a gramthe lu wei here tastes is exactly like the ones found in the night markets of taiwan and on the street corners at night you pick the ingredients you want and they braise it in soup to cook it instead of packing the braised food in a little plastic bag to take home they give it to you in a cup here to eatthe portions here are a good size items per person for a regular sized meal you fill out a piece of paper to order the food and drinks each paperseating is super limited you might need to sit outside on the bench

now im not one to line up for trending pastries at celebrity chef outposts but when we were invited to grab breakfast here i was excited for the excuse the breakfast egg sandwiches it must be said are magnificent my italian sandwich with spinach and mozzarella was phenomenal but if you need to pick one the one with the thick slab of bacon on it is a nobrainer that mouthwatering cut of hog meat is breakfast paradiseyou also wont want to leave without trying one of their crullers this seems to be the draw for many patrons these heavenly pastries will set you back and come in flavors including cinnamon and strawberryeverything else from coffee to beer other half is available here is top notch danny meyer does it right
been eyeing this place since they opened and finally gave them a try and i must say i was beyond pleased everything from the service to the food was nothing short of impressive here goesgreeted as soon as we walked in and offered menus the waiter was knowledgeable and very friendly we ordered the shrimp appetizer as well as the baked clams the appetizers came out quickly and upon digging into the clams i was blown away i cant even explain the deliciousness i was sad when i got down to the last one i mean not one bite went without biting into clam meat it was perfectly salty crisp on top garlicky yummymmmmmmmm im obviously having flashbacks which you will understand after trying them lol oh and the shrimp was good too but those claaaaammssssmmmmmm i had the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree and i was happy they actually respected the simplicity of the dish it was seasoned just right the sauce wasnt too sweet the meatballs were the right sizejust an all around great experience dining here i dont want to keep writing about how great the food here is because its hurting mejust put the address in your gps and go send me a thank you later lol
a great play i would probably not listen to the album quite as much as other musicals i could not tell if it was the sound system the actors or just the songs but some of the songs just sounded off the storyline overall was really good it manages to stay new a relevant but does not feel like it will be outdated it surprising that the play is so popular among those that have seen it or know about it but the play does not seem to be widely known
amazing not sure why they have lower ratings but i definitely worth giving stars i was randomly walking though ues and saw this cute restaurant they had a deal for the day i think which was a fixed menu for which includes a bottle of wine salad flatbread and a paella what a deal the owner i believe or gm was so sweet they gave us a free dessert because we originally wanted tiramisu but it ran out the food was amazing loved the ambiance and the service was perfect id definitely would come back here again

i came to this place being utterly confused what happened to hole in the wall then i was told its actually two restaurants sharing the same location during the day its the cool hipster aussie brunch spot and in the night it becomes this trendy intimate asian fusion barrestaurant wow thats pretty weird but cool way to fully utilize pricey nyc real estate they have a pretty small menu but everything we got was extraordinary i was a little skeptical about ordering the roasted veggie dish because from the name to content of the dish it just screams im just boring veggie order me if you dont want to feel guilty about only eating meat but oh my gosh that was the best roasted vegetables i have ever tasted it was out of this world the blend of the spices and the texture of the veggies make them taste meaty satisfying and savoryso good and so unexpectedwe also got the truffle burger honestly i expected it to be good already since it has truffle oil in it but it was also cooked to perfection on top of that i had a drink that was literally lit lit as in on fire and i am not abusing the word literally super creative and the the drink was delicious i am super happy that i can come to one single place in my neighborhood for the entire duration of the day good job whoever is the owner of these two places i was told its the same owner but different chef and staff
loved it visually its so amazingthe props were of course nothing shy from what disney would produce we sat about row from the stage and it was close enoughthe theatres inside are small enough to really anywhere in the orchestra area you have a great viewthey sell candy and popcorn and its minimum each so if you have kids bring your own snacks bc the choices arent good eitherthe genie was the coolest character out of everyone i even thought iago and jafar were awesome theres some things that are different than the movie like theres no abu instead aladdin has side kicks who look more like an aladdin than the actually guy who played him and aladdin himself had a bit of a weird tune when he sung just saying but everyone loved it
amazing beautiful cakes ready to go i had my boyfriends birthday party in less than two hours and hadnt prepared anything was out of town all week found empire cakes on yelp and went in picked a cake and had it personalized in less than five minutes i went for the dulce de leche which was decorated impeccably and tasted even better the frosting was the perfect airiness and flavor without being too sweet and the cake itself was the appropriate level of moist the service at empire was also terrific and so helpful im moving to the area and will definitely be getting more cakes or baked goods here
what an experience charles is definitely one of my most favorite meat places on this earth the vibe the service the set up of the restaurant the foodeverything together made this dinner experience one of the most memorable i am a huge fan of the old school cozy steak house vibe and this place hit the mark its a tiny restaurant with only about table tops ranging from maybe people per table very small thus make reservations days in advance at the very least i logged on at resy at midnight to make reservations for a month later since that was when the date to make the resy was available and the best time i could get at was a reservation worth it regardlesswe were a table of and shared the followingbacon delicious it was exactly what i would hope for in thick cut bacon crabcake good to split between people it was super crabby tons of meat soft on the inside with a nice simple crunch on the outside very well cheeseburgers between people definitely share if you are trying a lot of other things i was actually being a brat advocating for each person to get one burger on top of everything we were ordering but glad we went with splitting it was soooo good the meat was so juicy perfectly cooked the egg was a great charles prime rib super tender thick fatty juicy mouthwatering delicious prime rib bone in they provide seasoned salt on the side and au jus add both prime rib isnt my favorite cut but this was amazing beautifully cookedsides brussel sprouts truffle mac and cheese and elote corn all of it was delicious and plenty to share for a table of the corn and mac and cheese was super creamy the corn had a lot of acidity to it which was great to cut the fattiness from the prime rib and mac and cheese brussels were your typical wellcooked soft brusselsi also had their classic old fashioned with the meal the perfect complement to everythingoverall star dining all the way
the advertised haircut seemed suspicious at and but the illuminated retro tech barbershop pole made of colored foil and the strange more jade pool table green painted walls signaled something hip was going on when i found out the owner was from park slope i got my hopes up my barber meticulously manicured my hair with speedi have short hair so the cut was properly done but in a short amount of time ive noticed how some barbers will draw things out to make the job appear more specialexcellent hair cut and excellent servicethis is an old school barber run by nice young men theres a decent waiting area a coat rack and a restroom great value and service
i dont believe in psychics anymore but i did have a phase over three years ago of going to psychics i do not recommend visiting any psychic at all but if you do wish to visit one do it with some research that being said angela lucy was the only psychic i had visited around that time whose reading actually came true i was primarily interested in asking about my love life and i was seeing somebody at that time and hoping with all might it would work out ie i liked the idea of this person more than i liked this person and angela flat out told me it was not going to work out because he had another woman in his life who would be coming soon after at me every card she turned for me kept saying the same thing she was really compassionate i remember and felt bad that it wouldnt work out according to her predictions because i told her i really liked that guyshe predicted it would end by october or november before the year was over but told me not to lose faith in love since i would be married in a few years i have a small sample size but she was the only one who got it all right and did not feed me phony bs or overly negative stuff fun to try if you go to someone who has some insight but take all your readings with a grain of salt and dont go to a psychic without doing research
there is really only one way to describe our dinner at amelie and its four very simple letters omfgno seriously omfgamelie has been on my musttry list for a bit well both our lists usually for jaysons birthday i like to pick someplace i know is good like bar sixty five last year or at least a place weve been to as you dont want a birthday dinner to be an epic fail still i decided based on the menu which had four of his faves duck confit mussels truffles on anything fromages and charcuteries id risk it and take him herenow when i first walked in i got a little concerned it was packed and a bit small but he seemed to love it the second we walked in so i stayed with it and boy am i glad i did everything was absolutely perfect even the french guy who was running the place and seated us who gave a bit of french attitude was perfectthe oysters were fresh and absolutely a good selection we quickly boosted the order from dozen to a dozenthe tuna tartare delish and trust me lately our luck with finding decent tuan tartare has had some epic disappointmentshe loves escargot so do i but lets admit it most of the time its really all about the butter butter and dipping the bread in that lolim not a foie gras person jayson loved hisafter a few minutes you kind of forgot that you were in a tiny space because the vibe was so good and food as good as expectedmy recommendation definitely make a reservation we did otherwise youll get stuck sitting right at the front where all the foot traffic is and all the bar activity unless thats your thinglooking forward to a return soon

a delectable journey of mystery and desire created by umber ahmad discovered by tom collicchiohahaha man that the allcaps portion above is the richest thing ive experienced at mahzedahr bakery discovered you mean just like columbus discovered america no seriously man what exactly are you taking credit for discovering an exceptionally talented woman who belongs to a minority isnt return on equity enough anymore ill cut tom slack having seen his twitter posts and politics that the selfpromotion followed a negotiation agreement like those on shark tank because today that branding just shouts one word to me nope not woke but patriarchy enough said mahzedahr from urdu mazedar meaning delicious bakery truly lives up to the name its the only new york bakery ive fallen in love with in the last three years frankly ive given up on the edible garbage being introduced in new york just because its instagrammable a cookie inside a brownie inside an ice cream doughnut sandwich no thank you thats the worst kind of innovation possible like the turducken product of a lazy mind id much rather consume a years worth of dessert calories during a months travel across europeno such nonsense at mahzedahr very much in the spirit of old school new york bakeries it does the simple things right execution is where they compete and its flawless ive tried two different kinds of cookies a salty chewy chocolate chip cookie that was very different from the melty dark chocolate explosion cookie in texture and flavor the dark chocolate brownie is perfectly gooey not too much or less and neither dense nor crispy the turnover is great and so the cake slices have always been fresh excellent crumb frosting and fillings ive tried the pumpkin and the devil in ganache chocolate cakes both superb the highlight for me has been the justifiably awarded heavenly cheesecake with a tantalizing hint of lemon ive also loved the chocolate sable cookies with another different sandier texture as one would expectthe only miss for me have been the croissants but i expect thats because ive only visited them in the afternoon and the humidity had done its job no flakiness almost crunchy bite though even the design suggests thicker folds i dare not show up early at nyc bakeries only to be disappointed by a croissant pulled out of the oven at or am can no longer do that to my bodymahzedahr is clearly my favorite nyc bakery these days i also respect that they dont call themselves the best bakery in new york unlike the bakery in the lower east side where the moon is supposed to be really super i welcome the distinct approach to differentiation umber ahmed brings deft touches to the familiar comforting decadence as opposed to making empty claims on innovation i mean cmon lets be honest once dominique ansel had introduced the cronut the cruffin was a mere copycat a me too product just without the epoch defining hashtag heres hoping we will see a larger share of talented women get their just recognition in the baking world salud

i was a guest at a wedding this weekend stunning setting for an outdoor gazebo wedding right on the water the selling point there is a extraordinary walkway bridge extending far about an avenue long city blocks into the water that opens up on either side to an enclosed t shape right in the middle of the water like its own teeny island fantastic spot of photos serenity to get away from the party or view it from a gorgeous vantage point because its water sand rocks and shallow breakpoints encircling the venue hence marina del rey service was impeccable down to earth yet minutely helpful and courteous at one point i had lost my folder and jacket and sent a team searching for it only to find it with another guest the food was excellent the amenities were great but it really was basically the whole dam thing like a well oiled machine the place sells itself with a good team its not surprising they are booked months in advance
the sides shine more than the ramen here this is one of the few ramen bars in nyc that oozes an authentic japanese basement ramen shop vibe too bad you have to tip and your dont pay a vending machinei had the spicy bang bang boiled chicken as a side i didnt have high expectations for it but it was amazing it was zesty and the chicken had texture but wasnt rubbery the crunchy bean sprouts complemented the chicken well the chicken paitan based broth didnt have a very strong taste to it there was a lil bit of umami but not that intense it was good but i expected more theres better chicken paitan broth in nyc noodles pork belly and the pulled pork was top notch the cabbage and garlic were nice touches overall excellent taste and textures if youve been here in the past the mega paitan ramen the price went up a lil bit and you only get half an egg nowlines can be long but not as bad as some of the other popular from japan chains in manhattan they are efficient by taking your orders ahead of time
soft opening this week of it is quite spacious and i was greeted by staff with a warm welcome as i entered i think this place is perfect for couples coming in for a short break from shopping or a quick bite before the movies there are many different types of cakes and baked goods my personal favorites are the black sesame macrons and green tea macrons it is a bite size good like literately speaking it is gone before you know it the chocolate cake is delicious it is thick with cocoa flavor highly recommended macrons flavor size chocolate cake stafffriendliness overall havent had a chance to enjoy the teas that they have i would recommend hojicha since it has the perfect blend of aroma and tea the pastries are mostly glutenfree the ice cream comes with gf and vegan options i think i found my perfect goto place in union square i found out by chance that the same owner as raku since they left rakus business card by the front entrance definitely has the seal of authenticity factor to it when it comes to green tea and black sesame check out the pictures for reference

ive tried the other boucherie location but i decided to make reservations for the west village location for for a sunday dinner at when i arrived we were immediately seated and had the option of sitting on the floor level bar outdoor by the kitchen mezz and upper level we picked the mezzanine level and was extremely satisfied with the view of the entire restaurant there was great lighting and a slight breeze from the open windowsi started of with a glass of pinot noir which was perfectly paired with the steak frites i planned to order to start my friend and i shared escargot and it came in a hot plate already deshelled immersed in a buttery garlic sauce i dipped some bread in the sauce and it was delicious i ordered the steak frites medium rare the steak was cooked to perfection and my mouth watered before every bite the fries were super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside it was impeccable every day of the week boucherie has a special and different dish i went on a sunday and the special was lapin chasseur or braised rabbit with spinach my friend enjoyed the dish very much to finish off the dinner we ordered the pistachio bombe glacee to share per the assistant managers recommendation and it was nothing ive tasted before it has a thin to moderate layer of chocolate cakebrownie base with pistachio ice cream topped with hot fudge which congeals a bit each bite was to die for i will definitely go back just dessert words cannot describe it i had an amazing dinner with an attentive waiter i would give it stars if i could i recommend everyone to definitely try boucherie if you havent done so yet

ive had momosan bookmarked for awhile i didnt realize it was a morimoto restaurant my fellow diner wanted to cross this off his list after visiting bobby flay another fellow iron chef like morimotono wait for monday small restaurant with tight seating quite romantic as pairs sit side by side rather than across from each other unless youre at the ends of the communal tablesordered the tan tan ramen pickled napa cabbage pork bun and spare ribs tan tan ramen is a must order it had coconut milk it gave it a fantastic creaminess that was heavy but knowing it was coconut milk made it feel a little better big chunks of ground pork slice of long pork belly aji tama and a perfect amount of chili oil i also got fresh crushed garlic the noodles tasted fresh and you could tell by the uneven noodle strands a deliciously unique bowl of tan tan you wont get tired of the bowl of noodles stayed hot throughout the entire time i was slurpingthe pork bun was fantastic as well a thick meaty slice of pork some spicy mayo and a crisp piece of lettuce it really didnt need the recommended sriracha the pickled napa cabbage was tasty spicy but a little weird a few pieces was enough for me the spare ribs were fall off the bone meaty with a nice fried and sauced outer layerid recommend going early to beat the crowd because the line was out the door by the time we left at service was good our tan tan ramens came out way after people who sat after us got their ramen guess it just takes longer to prepare
overall best tacos ive ever had and ive lived in texas most of my lifewhat i got adobada taco on corn steak taco on corn steak taco on flour adobada on flour especial with adobada horchatataste excellent all of the food tasted authentic and by that i mean mexican not texmex after just the first bite i knew i had found my new home the adobada was my favorite it was juicy and full of flavor it was seasoned well and had a really good balance of flavors even when loaded with all the toppings i prefer mine with a squeeze of lime which they generously provide you can see them making the tortillas so you know they are fresh normally i can prefer corn to flour but here both are excellent the especial is a fried flour tortilla with cheese that is then cut and stuffed like a normal taco for a fried food it wasnt very greasy and there was just the right amount of cheese enough to let you know its there and be all melty in your mouth without being overwhelming horchata was pretty good but dont wait too long to finish it because it can get watered downvalue excellent for a taco i cant believe they are still in business only charging for a taco in nyc that is filled with so much meatservice counter service friendly line moves fastatmosphere casual it is located inside chelsea marketfacility you have to take tour taco togo and find somewhere in chelsea market to eat it because they dont have their own section of tablesneed to know they dont take amexwould i come back yeswould i go out of my way yesadditional info im very reluctant to try mexican restaurants this far north but im glad i did this place is awesome
came here specifically for the pickle ice cream which lived up to the hype the cool cucumber and sweetness from the soft serve are cut by the pickley brininess the giant tub of soft serve is spruced up by the addition of some dried pickles which are pretty but insanetasting have you ever had a dried pickle you know how dried fruits taste super sweet the taste of the sugar magnified by the lack of any liquids whatsoever well imagine that but with a pickle it just really tastes insane the size of the soft serve is pretty substantial youd think perhaps this is the kind of dessert that youd get sick of after a few bites but its really notwhat else if youre on the fence about buying an entire ice cream cone that tastes like pickle and cucumber you can ask for a sample then once you decide to order that entire ice cream cone that tastes like pickle and cucumber you can do so on one of the touch screens on the wall either enjoy your treat at one of the few wooden tables in the small shop or take it to central park
love this spot everything from the decor to the food to the drinks to the service and especially the playlist tbt anyonethey have happy hour until every day hello glasses of sparkling ros√© for this basic chick right here the wings are also really good talk to the bartenders theyre a lot of fun
we came here for brunch with friends and had two little ones the space is amazingly spacious and we had a nice loungelike table in front of the band the vibe seemed to work for all the brunch crowd families tourists etc the severs empathized with the baby situation and because of the casuallouder vibe with the band patrons were the same way the food was very good a bit on the heavier side but you know what youre getting into when you come here i thought the bloodies were a bit too thickchunky for my liking but this could be personal preference very concentrated and strong on flavor i definitely want to come back here again
a delicately balanced and thoughtfully curated experience of cuisine from northwest china dun huang is a wonderful gem for unique and authentic chinese food this is not your sweet and sour overly fried and sugarladen chinese restaurantwe loved the beef lanzhou noodles we had the wide ones but next time well get the extra wide the freshly pulled noodles were thin and springy a wonderful combination the broth was clean yet incredibly savory and flavorful this dish was a real starwe also loved the lamb rice pilaf the rice was prepared perfectly each individual grain of rice was perfectly cooked and packed an umami punchthe pickled dishes were nice with a slight preference for the eggplant over the radish the beef roll had a nice texture that was not quite what i expected the bing felt more similar to pita bread than the oily juan bing im used to both types have their meritsthe salted cold chicken was delicious but probably not the best bang for your buck the bao ba cha treasures tea was good but also on the expensive side i had to try it though since this tea is hard to find and its a treat whenever i get to have itfor the dessert we ordered the treasures rice pudding but they ran out awkwardly they charged us for it before realizing they didnt have the dish to serve they fixed it by giving us the fried black sesame pudding which essentially tasted like deep fried bao wan black sesame filled rice balls the honey drizzled on top was a nice touch my son thought the dish was too hot temperature the flavors felt more authentically chinese so they were not as heavily sweet as my kids wantedoverall an incredibly delightful experience next time well order two lanzhou noodles maybe with extra noodles the rice pilaf and maybe another pickledcold dish dun huang has all the makings of a destination restaurant definitely worth traveling for

i want to start off by saying if in some parallel universe i were to give sushi ginza onodera stars for their food which is an absolutely absurd notion id still end up giving them the full stars for the impeccable service welcoming ambiance and an overall superb and memorable experience putting the quality and taste of the food back into the equation i only regret not being able to rate this place higher than perfecti was here with my partner for their dinner kiwami course which runs per person the final bill will be inclusive of tax and the restaurant does not accept gratuityour night was definitely special we had the pleasure of dining in when master chef sakagami was in the new york branch and he made the experience that much better he was funny inviting and personable and watching him at work was nothing short of a spectacular performance each course built on the previous and nothing fell short of expectations unlike many of the other omakase offerings around nycgoing in i had assumed either the salmon course or the chawanmushi with caviar and uni would be my favorite however there was one black perch course that blew me away and turned everything i thought i knew about my preferred flavor profile upside down every ingredient is handled with the utmost care from the fresh sushi rice thats delivered specially for every other course to the fresh wasabi thats ground up right in front of youoverall its safe to say ive been spoiled by ginza onodera and i can see why they were awarded their second michelin star in ill definitely be returning for their lunch options at price points more easily swallowed

i am torn regarding this review i honestly truly do not want you to find out about this place to mess up my little oasis of nail perfection it is a small location with a solid set of ladies that do an amazing job with high quality products i have always been paired with eugenia not sure if that is on purpose or random she is a gem so it really has not been a problem for me i would recommend that you opt to frequent raquelles with some time on your schedule because they aim for perfection and that takes time i typically get a gel manicure and a regular pedicure my gel manicure has lasted about three weeks on average the pedicures are the best and also last a whilehighly hygienic and spotlessly clean this place fits the bill with standard prices gel manicure and regular pedicure run about there is a slight charge for using your credit card and there is a removal fee if you go in with your old gel still onthis is absolutely on my rotation even if not on the most well traveled road
i had an absolutely wonderful time at nougatine other night it was my first time dining here and since it is nyc restaurant week we had a lovely three course pre fixe meal that was to die for my one issue i left the restaurant extremely full first world problems my friend reminded me of the upcoming restaurant week in nyc and invited me to dinner my choice of course i had a list of choices and we decided on nougatine because well jean georges of course i have never been and it was a long time since my friend had eaten there i almost missed my chance at a table i inadvertently booked a table for am i have a no idea how i managed to screw that up and when i called to find out what happened the woman i spoke with explained my mistake despite there being no tables available at pm which is what i originally wanted there was a pm opening available which i jumped oni found parking in the street just down the block which was very convenient my friend was waiting for me out front and when we entered the building i was impressed by how organized they are we checked in with the maitre d and were able to check our coats at the same time all three of the women at the host table were gracious and pleasant we arrived a little before half past just in case we could snag an earlier open table we were directed to the bar to wait until our table was ready and decided to have a few cocktails we both had tasty mocktails i forgot the name of mine orchard blush but my friend ordered the thyme lemonade about ten minutes later one of the hostesses came to check on us and show us to our table we were able to transfer out drinks and she had our server bring our drinks to us that is a small gesture but it speaks volumes on their attention to detail we felt pampered a few moments after we got cozy at our table sarah came by to greet us give us menus and serve our drinks ultimately we were seated twenty minutes before our reservation time which i greatly appreciatedwe opted for the restaurant week pre fixe menu but in true foodie fashion we also ordered a few items a la carterestaurant week menu tomato soup this tasted amazeballs its a more than enough bowl of creamy tomato soup poured over a deconstructed grilled cheese the huge piece of buttery toasted sourdough and cheddar cheese in the bottom of the bowl was a nice touchsea trout sashimi my friends dish which he loved we both found ourselves pausing in between bites to savour it all roasted organic chicken my friends dish which was served with roasted winter veggies i tasted a bit of his romanesco and it had a nice smoky charwild flounder i really liked this dish the fish was served over spaghetti squash which i love and a light citrusy yuzu sauce i was becoming too full to finish my entr√©e so i had to make a decision either eat all my fish or take it home and save my tummy real estate for dessert needless to say dessert wonwarm chocolate cake i loved this its their signature dessert an upgrade on a molten lava cake served with creamy salted caramel ice cream i made the best decision to save room for dessert roasted pear my friends dish which tasted dreamy the pear is stuffed with nutella and paired with a pecan praline and whipped creama la carte foie gras my friends extra it was served on toast with pineapplemeyer lemon jam that i had to taste it was soooo creamy and melted in my mouth worth every bite burrata i ordered this extra the plating was beautifully simple it was a super creamy burrata ball sitting atop a meyer lemon jam with pumpernickel toasts amazing and probably the main reason i couldnt finish my entire meal the service here is impeccable our dishes were cleared on cue water constantly refilled and we were checked on regularly we were served hearty bread while we waited and i would suggest not eating more than two pieces because you will have a most difficult time trying to finish everythingsarah our server was great she had a wonderful demeanor as did everyone with whom we interacted my entr√©e was waiting with the maitre d when we left and i was given a number to claim it on the way out i would definitely come back and im happy to have had this dining experience
this noodle bar ruined ramen for me because it was so good my wallets crying because i can never go to another normal ramen place again we started with the wagyu beef dumpling which was meltinyourmouth delicious i started smiling when i bit into this and didnt stop smiling for the rest of the meal we also ordered the tonkotsu and the duck ramen both are flavorful with tender meats and a very thick broth the wall was made of paperback books it looked amazing it also gave the bar a very warm and cozy feeling pricest ramen ive ever had and worth every penny
decided to give this place a shot since my friend was getting a haircut in china town and i wanted sushi the prices are pretty good since the promotion is going on for lunch and for dinnerits a very small restaurant and you can only find it after you walk into a dark alley which feels little weird at first however the restaurant itself is actually well decorated and comfortable with a small bathroom all the food is ordered via ipad which is separated nicely into categories with appetizers rolls special rolls sushi and more when we do ayce we always love ordering few appetizers and soup or salad to warm up then some rolls and sushi then maybe few more sushi just incase we are still hungry or to satisfy all cravings and then dessertfor our appetizers round we got miso soup salad tempera shrimp and seaweed salad to share everything was good and definitely warmed us up for the sushisushi we got the spicy salmon roll another roll on the right side of the picture which we forgot what it was and pieces of sushi the roll we forgot was eh okay but the spicy salmon roll was one of our favorites everything was very fresh and yummyour second round we got more sushi and more spicy salmon by the end we were so full we decided to share a green tea ice cream the service is also super nice they seated us at a corner table when we asked for a middle table but it was understandable since its such a small restaurant we really enjoyed our casual mealoverall everything was worth it and we definitely look forward to coming back
the hype is real ive been dying to try lartusi for months now and finally snagged a reservation ive heard from multiple people that its amazing but theres nothing like finding out for yourselfmy boyfriend and i got the octopus bolognese tagliatelle rabbit gnocchi and hazelnut chocolate torta both the pastas were absolutely amazing it wasnt heavy with oil or sauce as most places pile that on the texture of the noodles were perfect and the gnocchi was nice and soft as opposed to overly chewythe dessert was also a delicious hazelnut chocolate praline type mixture with sea salt caramel gelato the ambiance was nice and romantic cant wait to come back and try the other menu items
ive been here a few times for lunch and it never disappoints the wings and their artichoke dip is my goto food is always great service is always fast i was here a few weeks ago and was attended by havolin who was behind the bar she made me her own craft cocktail the pink flamingo which was tasty and fresh perfect for this summer heat she was great very attentive i also had the toronja sour which was actually perfect for me since im a big grapefruit lover this place also has live music in the evening spacious and trendy will always come back if im ever around the area
i had a life revelation at the meatball shop my whole life i have never liked meatballs its a weird consistency its bulky and awkward to figure out how to eat and i just would rather have meat sauce we were with a large group and wanted somewhere on a fri that we could just walk in to at thankfully they were able to take us the menu is a a little confusing because it has you picking all the options yourself but in the end thats probably the best thing ever you first choose the type of meat veggie lamb veal beef pork etc then your starch pasta spaghetti rice risotto etc and then sauce mmmmm and veggie i went with the chicken meatball parmesan cream sauce and risotto and it was unbelievable unbelievable they also have this a la carte option for sandwiches and burgers i am not sure what made the food so great but for my first real meatball experience it was so delicious flavorful creamy i think the risotto was the best risotto i have ever had only two of us wanted dessert thankfully and we split the classic ice cream sandwich which was incrediblethe first few times it was suggested to come here i am not gonna lie i was hesitant and perhaps a bit pessimistic i fully admit that and am happy that i gave it a chance i have a feeling this is going to be a staple to our ues life
this place is a freakin treasure i dont believe ive ever had cambodian cuisine but after this experience its officially been added to my map of deliciousness bold statement alert might be the best sandwich ive ever hadit was lunch time and the line was out the door long but for good reason pro tip order on an app and pick up not naming any apps because there are a few out there but the one i ordered from was excellent and put me right at the front of the line so i could get back to work in a timely fashionordering to go lunches is sometimes a nerve wracking option but this pulled pork sandwich stood the test of the block walk the bread was crunchy and fresh each ingredient danced together beautifully and my eyes widened with every bite the perfect amount of spice fresh crunch and sweet savory perfectly cooked pulled porkafter i was finished my mouth was watering for more still is add this place to your bucket list if you want to make sure you live a good life i will gladly dodge the chaos of chelsea market for another go at num pang kitchen

phenomenal awesome fantastic no exaggeration no embellishment just amazingness in abundance if you love meat cheese its hard not to love this place and they are incredibly generous with samples although if the sample boards are empty they will grumble a little bit because its a busy place and a little bit of scruffiness is to be expected but theyve never said no and they always oblige sorry but when so many of the meats look the same and their descriptions sound very similar something needs to actually sell the product and theyve always let me taste for myself whats what and boy do they have some good stuff here and although its not cheap there are definitely some deals to be found and its a whole lot of wonderful
a few reasons for five convenient location for midwork day coffee oat milk incredible cookies that probably have crack in them though ive only tried the spanokopita v good the other food also looks strong matcha latte tastes like im drinking mouthfuls of grass and i love they have cupholders for cold drinks and ones that dont melt from all the while not cheap also not more expensive than other similar coffee shops bluestone blue bottle etc
thinking back to the spicy tan tan noodles that i tried is making me salivateit was sooo tasty the pork broth was super flavorful and the noodles were chewy and fresh the crushed nuts gave the ramen an extra nice texture everything from the meat to the vegetables in the bowl satisfied my taste budsthe interior of the restaurant doesnt look traditionally japanese at allor you can count the minimalist design that makes it japanese instead its a very hip and modern space
one of the top dining experiences in nyc period while it has taken me this summer restaurant week to dine here it does not diminish a very fine culinary moment elegant windowless room feels vip club like with fresh flowers and very attentive professional service we were a party of three at a corner banquetteatecauliflower and mushroomsbrook troutchocolate cremeux with chocolate covered cashewstotal lovely salted brioche starts the service and the food was stellar start to finish my british buds equally loved the food and dining experience
excellent i was born in san juan pr but raised in cayey little town minutes of san juan capital of puerto rico cayey is the home of guavate pork land so i know if the pork is good or not hahaha first i am not into eat pork every day but once in awhile is good i like to walk so i found this place walking my dog when i saw the yelp review i knew this place was a must i have been here a couple of times and every time the server is very nice and attentive its a very little place so i always order to go food pork excellent if you like chicharron fried pork tell them to put more hahahha people love chicharron i am not big fan but my hubby is for what i have seen the pork combination is dollars and pernil combination is dollars sauce they have a garlic sauce is mojito and is home made excellent rice and beans are great this place is awesome kudos to the chef

fasten your seatbelt and fly into the night of this easy breezy oasis in a new york cool looking locale of east broadway where the lower east side meets chinatown id passed by this place before not knowing what it was with its handsome large windows white pueblo exterior and dark interior with an orange glow of light creating black silhouettes of a lively happy crowd i was jealous i so wanted to be there my vegan friend and i came here spontaneously after a day at the beachthis place was on our wish list and just from the mexican angle as being both texans we were in absolute heaven the dining room was full but not overcrowded and not over loud the space has the feel of an old villa that someones cool uncle owns in mexico city so it feels antiqued modern and casualthis menu is vegan mexican and with a name like jajaja spanish for hahaha the place feels expectedly lyrical but its surprisingly sophisticated too let me tell you what we ate chips and salsa chose the salsa verde and let me tell you the salsa was so spot on that we saved the small bowl of it after we had finished our chips and at the end of our meal we split it and did a celebratory shot of it the salsa had a weight to it so it wasnt liquidy the tomatillos and peppers tasted so fresh and the heat was active this warmed our hearts and our stomachs the only imperfect part of the meal were the chips which werent homemade and while good they tasted like they came out of a bag mole enchiladas a big mole fan and let me tell you this dish made with jackfruit knocked it out of the park the taste was spot on the ingredients were lively fresh and the jackfruit was a fun protein replacement that had texture and felt honest the rice was perfectly done not over cooked but fried to a crispness on the outside my buddy had the chile relleno which was also perfectly executed and had a meaty texture with the vegetables that while were just trying to be vegetables gave you that kind of satisfaction you get from meatwe sort of kept just saying wow wow wow another possible name for this place then dessert camemy friend chose churros and while those arent my most favorite thing i was delighted they were freshly made crunchy and maybe coated with nuts the coconut dipping sauce was more like a paste but it was delicious this lovely cool little place feels special youll feel like youre a cool kid the place is dark but not pretentious the food is wonderful and healthy but affordable the place was rather busy and our waitress actually smiled throughout the entire meal and even wished us good bye thanks jajaja please consider changing the name of the place to wowowowy muchas gracias
i wont bury the lede here sushi by bae is probably my goto omakase place in new yorki have been following bae aka oona tempest since i saw a vicemunchies video on tanoshi in the upper east side almost three years ago to my disappointment when i eventually did visit tanoshi she was not my chef so when my friend suggested sushi by bae i could not have agreed fasterwe showed up right on time and were seated promptly although the setup sharing a sushi counter with this sushi by bou location took some getting used to but once the sake started flowing and fish got eaten we felt right at home in this omakasespeakeasy concept the selection is of course seasonal but my favorites on the night were the rosy sea perch shrimp surprisingly sweet and of course the toro hand roll the sushi was faultless but what really makes sushi by bae exceptional is none other than oona herself her warmth and enthusiasm stand out from the more reserved sushi chefs you may encounter elsewhere we chatted throughout the night about the sushi landscape in new york city as well as her place as a nonjapanese woman in a field dominated by japanese men nevertheless what she has most in common with the typical sushi chef is her humility that most japanese of qualities since we were the last seating on the night we lingered for over an hour after the last dish and would have felt right at home staying even longerat a flat sushi by bae is one of the best values for omakase in the city with oonas effervescent personality and daft punk also heard kanye wests all falls down britney spears toxic setting the mood the restaurant is a refreshing change of pace from the more conservative sushi spots that the city boasts i cannot wait to see what oona does next make sure to catch this rising star before she gets too highi had to save my review for someplace special and sushi by bae is exactly that
the food here is really really goodthe pizza is made right and they have some good choices we came out to celebrate my bday with some of my long islander fam and we ordered calamari good pumpkin ravioli yes in the summer and it was bomb drinks and more drinks the st nick my fav pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil and prosciutto honey truffle pizza was good margarita pizza meh whatever kids ate it and the thaitalian spicy thai pizza which was goodserver was good super cool dude
one of the best rooftop bars ive been to in nyc the view of the empire state building is phenomenal while the atmosphere is great i dont think a lot of people know about this place so its never too packed the bartenders are great and the drink specials are interesting all comes at a reasonable nyc priceif its too cold they have heaters you can turn on if you got smoker friends you can essentially smoke anywhere on the rooftop section you can expect me to be a weekly customer here
yum yum yum came here for date night with the boyfriend and this place is just as beautiful as its sister restaurant in the west village high ceilings beautiful lighting and design of a french restaurant this place is great as its spacious great for dates or group hangoutsappetizers we started with the escargot which came out bubbling it was plentiful to share between peoplesuper buttery with plenty of oils to soak up from the delicious complimentary bread they provide we also got the quailcaille farcie such a great app the bird is tender and stuffed with foie gras it is so good the flavor of the foie gras beautifully compliments the quail and balsamic glaze definitely one of my favoritesentree one thing this place doesnt disappoint on is portion size their plates are large in size and sooooo good you will never leave hungry the steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare which we requested their friesoh their fries i just love love love their fries tastes doubled fried super crispy on the outside with a potatoey inside i just looooove it get it as a side if it doesnt come with the entree you will not regret it we also got the rack of lamb medium rare racks beautifully portioned on carrots and tomatoes the lamb was cooked perfectly as well super tender and moist the glaze on the lamb complimented the meat well shining both flavors dessert we ended with the chocolate mousse super smooth and creamy with some fresh strawberries the perfect end to a delicious mealcocktails i got the mexican war which was made with mezcal delicious with a good hit of acid from the lime definitely a favorite of mine i also got the matterhorn this was also very good but may only appeal to certain palates as this drink has a strong taste of licorice i liked it very much in the crushed iceoverall a great dinner with super nice service in a beautiful restaurant
this is a warm hotel with lovely staff members i stayed here during my partners birthday weekend and i fell in love with this hotel i will most likely try to stay here as often as i canat first my plan was to check in early to surprise my partner but check in wasnt until i arrived to the city with my luggage around and planned to go to the hotel to check my bags while i run my errands and come back at check in time but the lovely agents at the front desk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a suite while i was checking my bags i was rambling to her about how im excited because its my partners birthday and i cant wait to surprise him and she asked me if i wanted to check in right now at at first i was a little confused and a little shocked she not only upgraded my room but she let me check in while i was there at long before my partner would arrive how sweet i even received a personal letter with my full name on it encouraging me to let them know if i would need anything else i felt very welcomed and it was a perfect start to my partners perfect birthday weekend everything was great my only regret is that i kept forgetting to get cash so i could leave a nice tip for the front desk agent and our lovely housekeeper by the time i remembered i had to rush to checkout to catch my train i kept the tip envelope with me so the next time i stay here which should be soon i can hand it in i would recommend this hotel to anyone who is commuting into nyc and needs to relaxing and comfortable place to feel at homewe stayed in room
my friend and i took out our friend out to per se as a graduation gift to congratulate him on making it through culinary school it took months to plan but totally worth it in the endservice is of course top notch if youre going to fine dine pay a premium price i sure hope the restaurant staff does it correctlyfood was amazing from beginning to end there were so many courses we were so stuffed and thank you for all the complimentary dishes as well since our friend interned therejust a fair warning this will be a long dinner gents dont forget a jacket be prepared for hours of deliciousness in formal attire
before i begin the review a few misc info soft opening the week of bathroom in the basement seats around peopleokay so the karage chicken is one of the best chicken karage that ive had in nyc im comparing this to chicken karage like bessou and other karage while bessous karage is this raju karage would be my first bite into the chicken reminds me of chicken nuggets it is juicy and tender on the inside beware of getting burned if you take a large bite everytime i go to raku i will order that karage i hope they can maintain that standard for oxtail noodle the noodles were handcut texture was smooth and firm even after sitting in the broth the broth was also very umami if i had to compare the noodles to tsurutontan noodles raku noodles would be the main reason is that the noodles are portion controlled i like tsurutontan with their generous portions this is one of those things that are good but limited in quantity savor it while you canthe agedashi tofu is pretty good reminds me of fish tofu from hotpot a nice vegetarian appetizer if you want something lighter the place is very new and has that japanese culture feel shoutout to my waitor for being so attentivecleanliness
holy hell this is making my revisit all of my conceptions about omakase my initial reaction to the price tag was that it sounded too good to be true you get pieces of utterly sublime fish as well as the option of a wagyu and uni handroll no tipping no tax the downside is that youre eating it in a cramped little space at the back of the bowery market within sneezing space of strangers and you have minutes but think of it as practice for building up your express train stamina and i definitely didnt feel rushed if anything i liked how they kept things moving reservations you need one not sure what it was like when they first opened but it was pretty easy you text a number with your name and preferred date and they give you a bunch of options being the grandma that i am i went with the seating but i think they have at least two every hour space youll sit on top of your neighbor as you stuff your face food ill always order fish over meat but good god that wagyu and uni was an umami bomb that i wanted pieces of check out my pics but they dont really do the taste justice its like trying to describe the taste of chocolate to someone whos never eaten it before if you want some dinnertime entertainment its always fun to watch the chef use a flame torch and see that wagyu spark and glisten and burn to a red heady hue in general the pieces were a little more adventurous than places like yasudanakazawa which stick to the classic nagiri of fish rice without much additional seasoning beyond wasabi and ginger sushi on jones steps a little outside the box with additions like charcoal salt on top of scallop which was amazingoh and definitely plop the down for the wagyu uni handroll its worth it i promise since the size worked out to about small pieces you can also order some extra pieces but be prepared to scarf them down as the customers for the next seating start trickling in price for the base omakase i thought the caliber was up there with places like tanoshi and nakazawa for a fraction of the cost life motto less talk more eating
what more can really be said about this place honestly not much so i will keep this short sweet i tried this place for the first time not long ago liked it so much we came back the next day yes the slice to try here is the spicy pepperoni sicilian it simply is amazing not spicy in my opinion lordddd all mighty the combo of the crispy crust tons of cheese pepperoni make this slice heavenwow simply delicious next time i gave the margarita slice a try very good loved the cheese taste of the pizza small location with standing room only so far never had to wait too long on line which was great but the line does move rather quickly cool to entertain yourself with the fun pics on the wall nice to see that some of these famous peps enjoy a normal not over priced pizza place service was quick prices are cheap what more can u ask forthis place has become a new favorite the pizza is totally worth the try will for sure continue to visit from time to time
i cant believe its taken me this long to get around to reviewing mothers ruin because ill probably have my ashes spread here once the bony arms of death open to embrace me tldr i love this place mr is a tiny little neighborhood bar with a limited selection of beers and cocktails that are fairly steeply overpriced for their lack of inventiveness why then do i religiously find myself stumbling into this rather nondescript bar at least once a week surely its not due to the rather gruff bouncer or the bartenders who while friendly rarely go above and beyond the bare minimum service nay my affection for this watering hole rests upon an unshakable tenet of my existence to love a waffle fry is to see the face of god i live and breathe by these waffle fries with their seductive aroma and perfect crisp picking between the french onion dip and the hot sauce is the closest ill ever come to knowing fully grasping how meryl streep felt at the climax of the classic sophies choice the burger is really top notch tootangential but important side note every one of my friends ive ever taken here has fallen in love with it too ill probably end up having my wedding here
where do i begin first off let me say that this restaurant has given me reason to actually get up earlier on the weekends since this place gets packed during eating hours ive been here like five times in the past two months so i know what im talking about you can also forget about coming here on frisat between the hours of because youll wind up waiting something ridiculous like two hours there are no reservations here and you can no longer call ahead to get a number you must physically be there in order to get a ticket strategies to actually getting seated here try coming for lunch they are open all days of the week around make sure your whole party is present or they wont be willing to seat you you can also come here earlier in the week like on a tuesday and arrive around pm additionally try coming as a party of two as ive noticed that the party of two tables tend to have a higher turnovermoving on the food here is actually fantastic the best ive had in new york when it comes to sichuanese food i think every sichuanese place has something that theyre good at but smh not only does many dishes well but also hits all the smaller things too service ambiance decor etc etc below are some of the dishes ive sliced pork belly w chili garlic sauce liang yi bai rou this appetizer dish is what these guys are known for the menu description is pretty accurate but the main feature of this dish is its presentation id say its good for first timers visiting the restaurant but is not too filling as a regular here its great but i wouldnt get it every stewed fish filet w pickled cabbage chili lao tan suan cai yu this is my favorite dish here and i order it almost every time i come here it is fish fillets so no bones it comes with pickled cabbage and a white slightly sour broth its slightly spicy but not overly pineapple fried rice i dont know why everyone complains when i want to order this dish it is probably the best version of this dish ive had like ever not only is the fried rice cooked to perfection but you also get quite a lot of shrimp thrown into the mix when combined with pineapple and a fried rice cooked with the right amount of oil it is orgasmic this isnt a dish id make my number one but if you dont want regular white rice this is a solid go stir fried chinese long beans si ji dou one of the perennial favorites at sichuan places the beans here are as expected not bad i say that because across almost all chinese places in ny this dish is served and its never bad i feel like if youre going to come here may as well skip the stir fried pea shoots w garlic dou miao this is one of those vegetables on the menu which is listed at market price which means what you wind up paying depends on the season pea shoots are considered to be a winter food so youre likely to pay more for these in the summer when scarcity kicks in it was good but again its kind of a waste to come here stand in line for an hour and order vegetables which can be made at fried shrimp w salted duck egg yolk this dish is not too bad and has a distinct duck egg taste you can tell its not an ordinary chicken egg due to the consistency of the yolk sauce which coats the shrimp i thought the flavor was good but my problem with this dish is that the shrimp isnt peeled but instead cooked with the shell on that means not that much of the yolk actually penetrates the shrimp and youre left sucking on the shells if you want to get any of the some chicken dish i cant remember rn stay steamed sweet purple potatotaro there seems to be confusion surrounding this dishes name principally because i remember it being listed as a taro and because it seems the word potato has been misspelled on some menus here as patato rest assured it is just taro the first dessert on the menu this is their most and only innovative dish a kind of like a taro puree atop a cracker the taro is also infused with some sort of sugary pop rocks its an interesting dish but i wouldnt recommend it it feels weird in your mouth due to the pop rock effect doesnt taste the best and is the most expensive dessert here boiled rice ball in sweet rice wine first of all theres no alcohol in this dish secondly you should get this one because its probably their best dessert here i have always been a fan of yuan zi and if its your first time here its a light dessert and a good conclusion to any meal keep in mind though that this might not be made in house but rather store boiled rice dumplings w sesame filling the third dessert on the menu is not bad either it is filled with black sesame paste and is a sweeter choice for dessert it is also possibly not made in house
when youre in this neighborhood just go when you walk in you will feel the warm local new york love you were meant to feel this is your local sports bar so as i stepped on i noticed well placed tvs all over the bar so at any time i can look up for a second and catch any game thats on right nowthey have plenty of beer on tap from ciders to stouts theres something for everyone here the food is really tasty as well they have burgers and wings and even tacos to name a few overall goodness for your tastebudsso what events do they do thereduring the weekday they do events like game night on wednesdays and trivia on thursdays they also do pay per views so if you are looking for the upcoming ufc or boxing match you know you will have a seat to watch with friendsoverallcome with friends bring yourself and get to the bartenders and server everyone will get to know and appreciate you
excellent fusion of asian and latini ordered the chicken tikka nachos and the thai beef paratha tacosthe paratha came flakey and not too greasy the thai beef had a sweet mango flair to it mixed with the crispy veggies i was amazed at how good the tacos werenachos came loaded love the indian take on the nachos the sauce wasnt excessive so most of the chips stayed crispy both dishes came covered with beautiful and fresh veggies all the textures and flavors complemented each other well
came in here during a sudden rainstorm completely soaked got the fresh grandma slice at their recommendation the guy at the register who might be the owner waived the credit card minimum fee citing that i was drenched and dont worry about it its a kindness that was so appreciated when i sat down for my slice i was happily surprised by how thick and hot and cheesy it was perfect for a postdrinks rainy night thank you village pizza ill be back to try more stars
two words fried chicken i cannot rave about their fried chicken enough the crispy skin with a blast of flavorful spices is a perfect wrapper for the juicy wing it is an unreal experience and oh yeah they have a bunch of other things going for them too such as their buffalo cauliflower which i prefer to buffalo chicken wings the service here is amazing this is one of those establishments that can and should become a goto spot for anyone within a radius their room in the back is nice for private events

heres how much i love chikarashi i recently served on a jury at the nearby courthouse and i honestly hoped that the trial would drag on longer than expected so i could keep eating here for lunch every daywhy did i wish that the wheels of justice would spin slowly because silly this is poke bowl perfectionevery element is on point seafood thats fresh af produce thats crisp and vibrant rice thats warm and slightly sticky crucially for my preferences the bowls are predesigned and done so with restraint so you can order quickly and also avoid the temptation of adding a bazillion toppings the chic minimalist ambiance seals the deal you feel like youre having an actual meal not just some quick calories in a fastcasual jointi dined at chikarashi three straight days during the trial and i only craved it more as the days passed by in fact im wishing i had a bowl right now when im miles away and when the trial has sadly come to an end
we came here on a saturday night at like and still had to wait minutes because it was so busy we were seated on a bench for two that was fixed to the ground interesting enough they offer both the normal and large size as the same price the only difference being more udon noodles large selection of hot and cold udons that i absolutely loved started with an order of asahi beer which they were kind enough to split into two glasses i ordered the tsurutontan deluxe which was absolutely massive there was an incredible amount of meat inside making it a very well balanced meal plenty of carbs from the udon yet plenty of protein from the chicken beef eggs and shrimp imo a very well balanced bowl of udon that i couldnt get enough of the fried sesame leaf was a nice touch but all i could really taste was the batter girlfriend ordered the mantaiko kamatama udon which was a completely different style compared to mine it had a light creamy caviar sauce and also comes cold unique flavor that ive never really had before in a bowl of udon it almost tastes like liquid sushi with the caviar and mantaiko mixed together absolutely stuffed after finishing the meal im looking forward to my next visit to try out all the other bowls of udon
i dont usually give to a place at first visit but this barrestaurant deserves itwe all know hells kitchen has a gazillion bars to choose from and adding more to the mix wont help much but thats where you are wrongthe signage outside does not say much its dark and blah i think its genius here is why no or very low tourist traffic come into this place as a new yorker i tend to stay away from tourist traps and this does a great job at thatthe decor is not fancy but dark looking and cool small tables large bar and back seats make the place feel confortable the dimmed lights that everyone seems to have are placed very strategically and makes it for a welcoming ambiancethe drinks i ordered the mayor mezcal based drink similar to a manhattan but with mezcal omg i wanted more the bartenders here have over experience combined and they show it with the specialty drinksthe food this is where they turn the magic onthe chef he is great at what he does seriously here is the magici think there are only places in nyc that sell chicken wings with white bbq sauce thats right white bbq sauce the wings themselves do not need anything besides the seasoning that comes with them but the sauce just adds that crack to itthe steak toast omg so delicious and simple steak on top of toast that they get from a brooklyn bread company the steak is juicy and the chimichurry sauce is just amazinthe icing on the cake is drum roll please the bone marrow this was on fleek it contained red roe dont remember if is tuna or salmon that gave the already delicious marrow more of a twist i personally enjoyed this the most remember these are shareable plates aka tapas style but they are all deliciousfrom now on this is the place to go do not pass go without going here
you simply cant go wrong at any nyc lukes lobster location the plaza hotel food court location does not have saladsso heres why i love lukes lobsterthis is a company that cares about seafood sustainability the seafood at lukes lobster comes from maine where sustainability is the law this means that only a certain number of lobsters may be caught i just read something within lukes lobsters newsletter or emails that said showed photos of how maine lukes lobster fishermen women will not take a female lobster if they see the eggs a notch is made on part of the shell to indicate that it is a female it goes back into the sea this helps with sustainability i applaud lukes lobster imhoi think lukes lobster roll is the best there is at least i can say it is my favorite i also love the shrimp roll and crab roll the lobster is sweet i believe its because its from maine if you love lobster shrimp or crab try a lukes lobster trio or just order one but try it youll love it
wow this place surprised me i usually prefer ramen or soba to udon but that was because i never had a great bowl of udon fukusuke is changing my mind because it opened recently the restaurant is pretty empty most of the time so getting a table is easy the space is small but clean and tidy we started with the japanese omelette with spicy cod roe which was fully and sweet and contrasted nicely with the salty and spicy roe i got the sansai wild plants udon with an addon of kitsune fried tofu and it was delicious the clear broth was very flavorful though a bit on the salty side the sweetsalty kitsune was a nice offset to the broth the noodles had a great chewy texture and is much better than the stale and overly cooked udon from other spots i rarely finish all the noodles and broth but i very happily shoveled this bowl down my boyfriend got the duck udon and was happy with his choice as well the duck was a nice pink as a side note the happy hour deal seems pretty good its everyday house sake wine chuhi asahi and bar snacks edamame takoyaki gyoza etc service was nice and quick the chef came out to ask how our meal was and was very enthusiastic please give them more business so he can continue making great udon

this is an extremely rare find in the ues a beer garden full of college aged kids but it works and its great we have now been a handful of times and its good for so many occasions sunday funday pregaming a tinder date watching soccer or sports its definitely a destination to relax in not so much to go out but it always seems to be very crowded they have large tvs lots of classic beer garden vibes with long wooden tables jenga connect trivia on all of the tables they have ping pongs and arcade games while it may seem overwhelming they still carry the chill beer garden vibe the music is great the average age is probably and they have a large section for outdoor seating on the side walk the food is your classic beer garden food germanish massive pretzels burgers fries and best of all free popcorn machine they have tons of delicious craft beer options although the beers add up fast this may have just been because i was trying to win at jenga which happened to take a long time
when i made the appointment i was shooting for like hoping for like but it ended up being lovei have been buying product from the rescue spa in philly for a while and was super excited to hear they were opening a manhattan outpost on a random sunday i booked a classic facial with katya the aesthetic of the spa is minimalist with a soho vibe definitely luxurious they have a lot of high end products in the shop part of the spa but no heavy sales push the spa area is lovely clean and plush after you check in they offer you tea or fruit infused water the facial itself was terrific the extractions were noninvasive but thorough my skin looked clean and glowing with zero redness the facial was very relaxing and my skin is still glowing a week later there is no heavy product push katya asked what i was using and suggested switching the order of the products which had a fantastic result but no you must have or you need thisi will definitely come back
you order the tasting menu and your first course is one radish one radish you look at it and youre thinking one radish what the hell how does that count as an entire course then even though you dont like radishes you put that radish in your mouth because its the only thing to eat on your tablethen your brain says ooooohhhhhhhhhhh its not just any radish its the most flavorful bit of purple and white vegetable fiber youve ever put on your tastebuds then you start to wonder how they put that much flavor into one radish and why other radishes cant taste this amazing and suddenly you spent five goddamned minutes thinking about that one radishevery course is a bit like that every dish every beer every wine it feels absurd until you put it in your mouth and realize it is absurd because its so damn goodi hate you blue hill because it makes me angry how good you made a single radish taste
this place was yum ive been eating a lot more vegan food and replacing things in my own fridge with vegan options cream cheese shredded cheese milk but i havent fully converted i think my italian side is struggling with the letting go of all the delicious real cheeses out there needless to say ive been trying more and more to cook vegan but sometimes im still a little skeptical of meat replacements here i ordered an avocado blt and was wondering what the b would taste like it was shockingly good no idea what in the world the replacement was but it was brilliant the way they smoked that vegetable was impressive to say the least it came as a wrap not a sandwich which i didnt mind just a side note in case thats a deal breaker for anyone since there wasnt any thick bread just the thin wrap you really tasted all the flavors of the inside thinking about this right now is making me hungry i also had the avocado fries avocado slices deep fried which i split with two other people its a lot for one person if youre also going to have a main course but two people can easily finish as an appetizer my friend ordered the carrot cake and i wasnt going to try it but curiosity got the best of me deelish the coffee was really bad but i mean whatever the three things i did try blew me away maybe my review will change after ive had a million vegan dishes but i still am very impressed when theres an all vegan meal and i dont miss cheese or eggs i really want to go back and try one of their burgers or honestly pretty much anything on the menu
super cute d√©cor one of the walls is hand painted very igable located a few blocks away from the bd trains free wifi which leads me to believe this is a good space to bring your laptop and get personal or professional work done they take card here street parking available i read about this place after it was featured on an eater nyc article that appeared in my feed this past friday evening and decided to come check it out over the weekend since id be in the area on the block that this place is on this place definitely stands out as it is the most modern looking one amongst oldschool storefronts the d√©cor and ambiance is very cute and homey there are big tables that can seat a group of one bar high table with two bar stools and theres also a bench this place is a good place to eat and catch up with friends since its easy to chat in here without having to scream at the top of your lungsi heard about the infamous avocado coffee smoothie and had to try it it looks that the price of the avocado coffee smoothie has decreased based on the initial reviews below currently it is priced at which i am not mad about for three reasons they use a shot of tobys espresso which is expensive enough on its own if youve ever had a tobys latte which is about they use half an avocado in the beverage which is more than a scoop of guac at chipotle and they charge you an additional for that and the avocoffee smoothie is really creamy filling and can be a onthego meal replacement this drink is the bomb and i would most definitely buy it againi also tried the lox avocado toast and this was really tasty as well the price for this can be a turnoff at first but it is much better when you see the plate since everything is at a ratio the toast comes with cream cheese avocado a hearty helping of lox paprika and a side salad if youre thinking that this is a bit pricey you should consider the other factors a standard lox bagel in the city is and that comes with bagel the main filler item cream cheese and lox for more you get avocado a side salad and a nice indoor place to sit which pretty much leads to a more balanced midday meala toast of the avocoffee smoothie will fill up a small person while a toast majority if not all of the avocoffee smoothie will fill up a normal person who can eatperhaps think about creating a rewards program linked to the credit card used personally i find myself returning to establishments where there is a reward perk in place
wow im stunned this place is amazeballs we got reservations for on a saturday night texted on friday night before before we arrived i got in a huge fight with my dining companion when we got there there was a huge confusion on seating and we had to wait for everything to be sorted out we get seated all the way at the end near the employee room smooshed together the lovely manager josh gives everyone free sake and extra sushi for the little delay mind you the wait wasnt even that longdef not something to be complaining about but def the way to get me coming back for more thoughthe first couple of pieces were sooo good i looove ikura a lot and the ikura did not fail to shineikura lot about this roll all this time i still have not forgiven my dining companion and then the uni came let me tell you unid this this was soooo good that it was able to warm the cold shoulder treatment i was giving to my table mate and i just had to forgive him to tell him how good the uni was my cold shoulder treatment is usually prescribed for at least a good strong hours thats how good the uni was josh manager tells us that they buy their uni depending on the tides at the time so youre guaranteed the best of the bestservice is excellent here josh saw my resting bitch face during the beginning of the meal and was so worried that the seating fiascofood was ruining our mood and he purposefully came up to us to make sure everything was ok hes in charge of quality management which is great cause he really knows his stuffhis first omasake was in japan when he was definitely managed when talking about affordable sushi sugarfish is my usual go to restaurant to talk about sugarfish is about this is this boud sugarfish waaayyyyy out of the water def more than worth the extra ten dollars not even comparable sushi by bou makes me want to change my sugarfish rating from a star rating to just a because this place sets a very high bar for affordable good sushi also some japanese places dont offer soy sauce or wasabi on the sideany extras the sushi needs is already added in by the chef this place also encourages you to eat with your fingers the proper way to eat sushi they give you a little wet napkin to wipe your in between pieces so if you dont wanna look like a sushi amateur eat with your fingers not chopsticks and dont ask for extra wasabi or soy sauce
wah fung no truly is number in my book in terms of price quantity and quality of food served this meager space on hester street has a perpetual line out the door and for good reason at just you can expect two meals worth of savory flavorful meats and vegetables roast duck and roast pig will cost you an extra but its worth the small hike in price they also allow you to half and half between meat selections at and equivalent charge meats come with an option of rice and cabbage or noodles out of all the varieties ive tried so far the roast pork is by far my favorite the thin slices are chewy and tender with a hint of sweetness to keep your taste buds engaged the roast pig is also a popular item crunchy pig skin with fatty soft pork gives you added texture and enhanced salty savory flavors be sure to come here early if youre interested in the roast pig it sells out fastthis is one of the best bangs for your buck you can hope for in manhattan if you dont mind a small wait this is the place to be for a casual bite to go
out for a solo dining expedition and still under the weather last night i decided to try out davelle a new and unassuming allday japanese spot on the les as few of my usual dining companions appreciate oden the focus of their evening menu i figured this was a good one to scout on my own firstaround pm on a weeknight it wasnt crowded just a few small groups coming and going similar to their sister spot izakaya in the east village the decor is simple but thoughtfully considered exposed brick complements a weathered metal wraparound bar and hanging bunches of dried flowers its very cozy and a little rustic chill music like tame impala played over the speakers at a reasonable volumethe menu is dominated by oden for the uninitiated its a simmered dish with components like hardboiled eggs stewed vegetables sausages and various kinds of tofu the broth is light in body but a little earthy if youve never tried it before some of the components can seem a little intimidating as theres some names you may not have heard of and some unusual textures but the flavors are typically mild and wholesome and i dont find it to be much of an acquired taste the staff is also happy to explain pieces and help you pickin many places oden is served all together like a hotpot but here they served each piece to me individually possibly because i was eating alone and not in a hurry you can order by the piece most or get a set for or for i found the five oden set to be filling and quite a good deal though my appetite is on the smaller sideif youre not in the mood for oden they have several japanese comfort food entrees like napolitan spaghetti and pork curry as well as a share plate section with fried chicken pickles and the like do note that tax and service is included in the pricesfor my five oden set i went relatively traditional with enoki mushroom in tofu konjak yam cake gobou stick fish cake and fried tofu each piece was beautifully rendered my favorites were the mushrooms tucked away in a speared tofu pouch dusted with chili seasoning and the gently flaking fish cake the broth was simple and warming this food is almost meditativeeach piece was brought out individually once i had finished the previous bowl resulting in my visit lasting about half an hour this was one of my most successful solo dining adventures yet i always had something to do instead of just scrolling through my phone and i could take my time i never felt awkward and left feeling relaxed staff was very polite and sweeti hope they can both succeed in this space and maintain their peaceful atmosphere for now its byob and it sounds like theyll be getting their liquor license in the next few months ill be back to try out their daytime offerings
recently revisited for a date night and had a much better experience this time around i made a reservation online easily for a few weeks in advance but the restaurant didnt have many empty tables while we were there so id definitely plan aheadstarted off the night with the royal engagement and the don for drinks both of which were very sippable the don came with a side of chocolate candies to enjoy with the drink as wellas many other reviewers have noted the complimentary bread and butter is amazing you get an entire mini loaf of fresh baked bread seriously when we cracked it open it was still steaming and salted whipped butter for food we split a half dozen oysters ox cheek mac and cheese and the baked chicken for two everything was delicious especially that mac and cheese the chicken was prepared ways the white meat came plated with morels and some sort of puree while the dark meat came in mini sliders and a separate pot with jus poured over it so good not as good as the nomad chicken but still deliciousdessert was the apple tarte tatin for two the panna cotta from last time is no longer on the menu thankfully which was seriously one of the best desserts ive had nothing fancy about it just a perfectly prepared apple tart with caramel sauce drizzled all over it and i couldnt ask for moremeal ended with complimentary almond financiers would definitely come back here for another special or even not so special occasion also they have the best smelling hand soap ive ever used
the quick loved the old location and im now obsessed with the new location delicious empanadas great sangria overall fun vibe and plenty of seating great at any time but phenomenal for late night eating when you dont want the party to endthe details sober or drunk this place is great everything ive had has always been tasty and the vibe is always on point not sure if people come to start the party or on the party but either way this place is funthe damage an empanada plus plenty of entrees and sides available too

i thought i left a review about my visit here a year ago with a coworker for lunch so i make good on spreading the good word surprised i didnt review this spot but i confine my review to this particular visit since therere so many locations throughout nycreliable spicy and a few nonspicy but spice level is not much editable at order as their recipes are largely proudly fixed lovely goodness at all opening hours at a great value i always order the mt qi and here it was the same reliable favorite as it is at its many other nyc locations with the same awesome tender beef superly flavored and spicy soup perfect noodles all presented with fresh speed in an efficient environment the same allimportant napkin holders are at a few spotsthis locations memorable namely for that long corridor from the kitchen towards the rear where therere many more seats and a kitchen thus a pickup window and no loftbalconeymezzanie level seating thus a pretty backed up crowd for ordering and seating and eating all thru the door even or especially in the winter months
totally in love with this place but note its on the east side of though the number is even and below the odds are on the east side i ate the same meal two weeks in a row on sundays postyoga at my friends around the corner and could eat here twice a week and not tire of it lamb and chicken kebab to die for the lamb is tougher but the spices are unlike anything ive ever experienced the chicken is tremendously tender and that yogurt dipping sauce i could eat by the gallon the rice is also phenomenal i dont know why but its just addictive hours too best meal in ny at the price
seductive stately dining room with ornate details i ate here wednesday and the front room is stunning nola and fancy southern food in nyc with some updated twists shades of rott bone nearbyatevegan catfish shrimp gritsbrussel sproutsi am not a vegan but appreciate the effort the peppery brussels super seasoned heads on shrimp of the shrimp grits rocked my palate awesome service too but the old school hip hop was a tad loud for my taste
im never one to be on the lookout for pizza or burger places but i have to say that emily blew me away we had reservations maybe a month in advance for a friday night dinner and they were definitely required as we heard others being turned away with hour waits we ordered the classic combo that was recommended by friends and the waiter an emmy burger and a grandma pizza our waiter said his personal favorite was one of the pinks pizzas with vodka sauce the arenstein so we dove straight in for that choice the pepperoni pickled chili and honey combination was the perfect medley with savory deliciousness accented by a hint of sweet the burgers pretzel bun was divine and the fact that it came with curly fries was just the cherry on top definitely come here asap your taste buds deserve it
great beers super staff terrific space five stars for milk and hopsmy beer group had a meetup here recently and it was universally well received i did not eat but the people who did liked the meats that they had the beer selection had a great variety and there was a beer for everyones taste the space is clean and easy to navigate which is important when we have a big crowd due to the volume of beer that was being consumed the bathroom line was usually about four deep at any given time but otherwise ther were no logistical issues service was stellar from everyone fast and friendlywe had over people in the group and nobody had to wait for a beer will definitely be back
i just had a trip in lisbon where i had some of the best egg tarts in the world and i knew when i came back to new york i would never have the opportunity to eat such delicious treats ever againuntil frankie portugal came into the picture i saw someone had a box of their egg tarts at a bar in the east village so i bookmarked it on yelp and then i came and devoured for a box of it was it is definitely worth a try here we were fortunate enough to get it right out of the oven it was still hot when i had my first bite this place can definitely compete with lisbons the crust was super flakey with multiple layers of crisp the egg custard was super creamy on the inside sweet and delicious sprinkle on some powdered sugar and cinnamon like the portuguese so good i had the remaining cold and it was just as good yummmmmy i will definitely be back again devouring these little goodies
this is the best park we have here in new york city it goes all the way from to like ive been to central park a lot of times today i attempted to walk the entire park and i did well kind of the thing about central park is that you can easily get lost or walk around in circles lol my journey began at columbus circle right at this entrance you have the horse and carriage as well as bike and rental this park is beautiful and has plenty of things to do on a gorgeous sunny or rainy day they have boat rides restaurants museums and many playgrounds for children in the summer time theres even more to see such as victoria gardens the pool carousel and the list goes on what i love about this park is the beautiful views all the hidden cascades and of course the flowers central park its great for hiking jogging and walking on top of that they also have a zoo not as large as the bronx or queens but a decent zoo in the winter time they have the ice skating ring so plenty to do all year long theres also lots of hot dogs stands and about restaurants tavern on the green and loeb boathouse i want to say that i started out at street and then i walked to like and somehow ended up again back at street so be careful as there are many paths that may lead you back to point a lol its a maze but a very beautiful one to get lost in
this place has great service i never ran out of water or had a need that went unattended despite this place being packed for cinco de mayo we watched the tables near us get flipped within minutes they have a very strong busserrunner staff our server was great too even though it was apparent that he was very tired and has probably been working all day his attitude was still very positive the food was great as always the arroz con pollo was a tad bit undercooked but everything else was so delicious the oxtail empanadas isnt an actual empanada but its still damn goodif you eat pork definitely order their mac cheese the last but not least they have the best whipped cream i have ever tasted it has a thick greek yogurt consistency and it doesnt melt quickly i always love coming here

wow dinner for two at boucherie park last night they have certainly raised the bar for fine dining on park avenue the restaurant is gorgeous upon entrance the huge bar is on the left with lots of table seating on that side the regular tables are on the right and go back into the distance the whole place is decorated with white subway tiles and huge framed mirrors on the walls authentic paris bistro surroundings the menu has interesting french selections and there is a separate menu for steaks several selections are for two persons for starters we selected mussels with a wonderful cream sauce and small slices of sausage i had the arugula salad with candied pecans scrumptious we each had two glass of generously poured red wine i had the center cut fillet mignon served perfectly medium rare just the way i like it julie had a beautiful portion of cod served upon a nice orange sauce we shared a desert of pistachio ice cream served on a chocolate cookie two coffees with refills and we were stuffed the waitstaff hostess and everybody we came in contact with couldnt have been more gracious they treated us like long lost friends i have to say that this is the finest saturday night dinner we have had this year this is a new place my advise get in there soon before reservations become difficult to get
to the staff at gem thank you for an amazing dinnerthe fact that you can get a delicious tasting menu at a fairly decent price is a winner and the fact that this is more of a homey setting not a fancy schmancy restaurant where you can be casual and have an amazing time i am soldmy friends booked this place for my birthday and i am so grateful to eat here they just changed the menu for the day so i cant compare it to a prior menu but every dish was delicious from beginning to end i was actually surprised that the cabbage was one of my favorite dishes im not a big fan of cabbagechef flynn is a rising star whos food you have to experience for yourself and the staff was on point for the entire servicereservations are a must but i loved this restaurant so much i booked it for my best friend his fianc√© in celebration of his engagement thank you for delivering
where do i even begin with this one this place is beyond amazing and thats coming from a real nyer who knows a thing or two about pizza if youre not familiar with artichoke basilles pizza well youve been warned that eating anything more than one slice might just be overkill the slices here are huge but not obnoxiously big their dough is different from what youd get from most other pizzerias in that it resembles more of bread type consistency which is necessary to hold whatever sauce is on it i usually go with their classic artichoke slice which reminds me of artichoke dip on top of a pizza with a nice amount of mootzits heavy keeps my belly full and is a bit pricey for a slice but you get what you pay for all there is to really say about artichoke basilles do it
while i intended to search for a decent steam room in nyc i instead discovered modo yoga in freezing snowy weather a hot yoga studio where students practice in a heated room what i really liked about this studio is that it is not only a studio where students practice yoga in a heated room but there is also an incorporation of spirituality and safe space which is something rare when it comes to hot yoga or classical yoga theres this calming effect after the practice which is something that usually i feel after practicing kundalini so far i have taken only two classes and i really liked sashas class his class had me coming back for a double and considering about signing up for a month unlimited modo yoga is located two doors down from benefits and you have to walk up the stairs because the elevator does not go to the second floor the staff members are really nice and the mats blankets towels and reusable bottles are onthehouse for first time students even if you come back for a double on the same day with a few hours gap for a reusable stainless steel bottle you have to leave your id at the front desk they have filtered water to fill up your bottles and hot tea too after practice the mats are to be wiped down by each individual students on the hanging rods the changing rooms are equipped with lockers with builtin locks two sinks three toilets and four shower stalls it is recommended to drink about two glasses of water minutes prior to the practice and two glasses of water with lemon sea salt or an electrolyte replenisher after the practice for the first month unlimited and afterwards
i have sworn up and down that levain is the best cookie there is to find in this beautiful city of ours but ill be damned if chip doesnt inch close i now present a highly scientific comparison of the two and while i think levain still comes out ahead theres no way id ever turn down a chip cookie variety this one is in chips bag while i appreciate levains philosophy of sticking to three triedandtrue cookies ccc and walnut oatmeal raisin and chocolate and pb chip throws down the gauntlet with a dizzying array of options thus far ive tried the smores nutella with sea salt and white chocolate and macadamia they are all reasons why god intended you to eat one or two whole cookies and take a restorative nap and trust me it took some real willpower not to just throw in the butterscotch and triple chocolate too taste pretty much the same both boast an enormous gooey center and taste kind of like a scone or biscuit both are more spherical pucks than a traditional flat cookie both are better in your bellybang for your buck levain is a smidge bigger for roughly the same price ugh this was entirely unproductive and i think im a few pounds fatter from all of this scientific research but it was worth it buy two get yourself an ice cold bottle of milk and then eat them in the sun in a park with some puppies playing at your feet to achieve nirvana
turquoise velvet couches colorful warm flowers puffy and scrumptious pastries hints of goldfinished furniture and marble decor what more can you ask for this cafe soon to be restaurant takes up the nicelylit half of an upscale furniture store with the flower shop in the corner the bar in the other corner and an open kitchen behind the counter high ceilings and large windows the ambiance is incredible though i imagine there will be some hiccups with service and organization in the beginning i expect la mercerie to be the next highly anticipated caferestaurant in the areai enjoyed a finely crafted cup of cappuccino and a bowl of choquettes and they were delightful almost finished the entire bowl before my friend arrived whether its to catch up with a friend have a date night with your significant other or spend some time by yourself la mercerie will be a welcoming place i have high expectations for their full menu which will be available earlyfebruary
two little red hens consistently makes me want to come back for more i highly recommend a visit to this tiny but famous bakery whether youre a local or not dont be shunned when you see a line out the door this place is really tiny but the line moves at a decent speed i have yet to try everything but i can speak to several of their dessertsi will note first if you are coming by around the holidays expect a long line out the door order ahead if you want something guaranteed also they serve pies in the morning cupcakes in the evening and specific flavors on certain days of the week i have tried numerous things here the mini key lime pie key lime cupcakes peanut butter cupcakes brooklyn blackout cake and cupcakes red velvet cupcakes chocolatevanilla sprinkled cupcakes holiday themed cheesecakes coconut creme pie chocolate mousse pie triberry scone chocolate chunk cookies and oatmeal raisin cookieseverything is amazing my personal favorites are the key lime cupcakes key lime pie and chocolate mousse pie their selection can be limited or sold out by certain times of the day so your best bet is to come in the morning or early afternoon except if you want cupcakes all their cookies are large soft baked and delicious their creme pies have a wonderful texture the list can go on but i would recommend their creme pies and cupcakes first i love this place its become one of my favorite neighborhood spots for parties ive made sure to stop by and get some dessert to bring the reaction has always been positive its a definite must visit in the upper east
like many others the thought of having artichokes on my pizza was very different for me but i can honestly say that artichoke is one of my favorite pizza slices of all time lets be honest its a different creation than any other slicethings i like here every single slice they serve but i highly recommend the artichoke slice of course bigger crust and dough creamy and cheesy goodness along with the size of this slice makes not only every late night drunks dream but even for those who are looking just to enjoy this beast i mean if i cant eat more than slices then their slices must be beast i can serious chow down on some pizzathings i dont like ive been to a many of their locations and like many of others this one gets packed especially late nights oh and its super small so the line does out the door i think those are the only issues i have here thinkingthe service is quick which makes the line less scary and despite being bombarded by a million hungry new yorkers they seem to keep it friendly seriously guys how do you do it the patience is unreal ive never been the biggest fan of paying bucks for a slice but i make an exception for how good these slices are basically what im trying to say is that you must try an artichoke at least once in your life

review strictly for cronut as a marketer there is something incredibly fascinating about the success of the cronut trademarked legally by the james beard winning fancy nancy dom ansel i remember the hype several years ago and all the other hybrid foods it created i also remember rolling my eyes at the hype and how everyone will get over the cronut till the next food trend comes outwell i was surprised to learn there is still a huge line outside to get cronuts also this location only makes a set number of cronuts per day your loss if youre too late and sometimes with a maximum number you could buy per day two is the limit with a huge linebasically there has to be something good here if this keeps selling outand i can safely say that the cronut is worth the hype it has dimension a trifecta of flavor and its just the right size for the steep price per cronut this months flavor is blackberry buttermilk and it was absolutely delicious and worth the possible caloriesim not sure if i will be back every month to try the flavor of the month but this is not a bad option if youre feeling down or happy
a rare gem in nyc exquisite food wonderful service and a rustic ambiance make this one of my new favorite restaurants in nycwe came to gramercy tavern as a party of originally i had made it for people and added at the last moment i was worried that they would be unable to accommodate our last minute change but they were able to increase our table sizei was also worried due to the fact that we were such a large party and we had a special cake that we wanted to present at the end of the evening that things might not go entirely as planned side note the last time that i had a special surprise cake that i wanted to present at the end of the dinner our waiter at another restaurant walked right up to the host of the evening who the cake was for and asked when would you like your cake to come out when uhit was supposed to be a surprise yikes we were nervous to say the leastwe all started with cocktails and champagne and the entire table opted for the seasonal tasting menu which had several courses perhaps the wait staff was on point they all assembled at the table together to remove dishes as well as to bring new items they did not interrupt your conversation which i really liked as theres nothing i cant stand more than being in the middle of a story and someone butting in with would you like still or flat water just give everyone a minute to settle in and look at everything that they did i was impressed i would describe it as overly attentive without you even noticingthe food was just you have to try it for yourself definitely opt for the larger tasting course menu as there are some real gems on there i dont want to go into the food too much to ruin anything but honestly everything was out of this world on par or even better than a lot of the michelin restaurants in nycthe cake event went on flawlessly as they brought the cake in its entirety on a beautiful raised plate so our guest could see it as it actually had her photo on it and then they cut the pieces up and brought everyone a piece and the guest was given the face cutout from her cake it was very cute there also was no cake fee which i was shocked by usually places charge around a person to cut and serve the cake i find that ridiculous and sometimes it deters us from certain restaurantsi really enjoyed our time at gramercy tavern and want to go back i felt like for the price and the quality of food it was well worth it

all this hype about this place and ive never been however i finally was able to hit this spot last night i absolutely did not expect there would be a huge wait at pm it really took me by surprise especially since this place is hidden on the floor in a building of ktown once the elevator opened there were so many people waiting for a table luckily for my boyfriend and i our friends were already seated and waiting for us patientlyi had no idea what to expect since ive never really done kbbq the only kbbq ive had is picnic garden from flushing and its only alright since its a buffet we ordered the beef and pork platter and oh my gosh it was amazing i liked the fact that the waiters will help cook it and cut it for you tooi really liked both the pork platter and beef platter the pork belly in the pork platter is crispy but not overcooked thank you waiter and you can order rice on the side which i highly recommend and it goes really well with it the condiments that come with the meal are also super yummylike the bean paste ugh i am so obsessed with that bean paste i can eat it by itself or just the bean paste with the rice the beef platter super dreamy i love it i want to come back here already my body and soul is ready to relive this experiencefyi listen to the beautiful sound of it sizzling its delightful and soothingwill definitely come back soon
love being able to have bowls other than your typical chipotle and poke one of my favorite cuisines is korean so of course i had to try their seoul bowli love all the flavors that were encompassed in the seoul bowl the sauce was mildly spicy with a bit of a sweettanginess to it the bean sprouts provided a crunch when mixed in with the rest of the toppings and quinoa i was really happy with the freshness of ingredients and the option to have quinoa instead of rice also to note they had a lot of asian flavored canned drinks which to my surprise was really good i tried their lychee
we were tipsy one night and couldnt get into any karaoke bars we must have decided that we wanted to eat cus we sat down to a diner at about just to prove how good this place is there was a minute wait everything about this experience was incredible until gster ate all the pierogis this was my first ukranian dining experience and had i been fully aware i may have thought twice about going thankfully i didnt patch and i split the french toast peroigis sean got the stuffed cabbage and gster never ordered i was so excited to try the pierogis and once they were served we were too busy eating the french toast that before we knew it we looked down and there was only left patch knew not to blame me since i had never had them so gster was the easy culprit gster didnt even realize we had ordered them not him thankfully i still got to try a few and i actually really liked them but liked the cheese ones the best its like a dumpling ravioli the french toast was perfect and i can only imagine what the omelettes are like the stuffed cabbage was apparently really good but a little cold the beers were massive and the service was excellent this is an absolute must and i cant wait to go back
what a great new place for fresh teas i love the fresh fruit in their fruit teas so far ive tried the grapefruit green tea and the super fruit green tea and they have both been delicious their spicy tuna roll also tasted very fresh and is a nice touch if youre looking for a light meal or snack the employees have been helpful and attentive and it really feels like they pay special attention to their craft im excited to come back to try additional items on their menu
no doubt in my mind this is the best pizza in new york city this is saying a lot since there are so many great pizza parlors in the city of course its a matter of personal taste some like their pizzas greasy so the oil drips all over their fingers some like their crust thin others like theirs thick preference for toppings is all over the place the only pizza thats awful is sold at the now ubiquitous stores that sell reheated prefrozen pies my pie makes authentic roman style pizza the flour for the dough is imported the ingredients are fresh the slices are square it tastes like the pizza i eat in rome at the pizza franco e cristina on the via del portico dottavia even if you try it and dont agree that its the best youve had at least you can say you had authentic italian pizza right here in manhattan near bloomingdales
i just found out keki opened another store in koreatown so i had to run over to make sure it was real i just sampled the greentea cheesecake and it was delicious i had wanted to buy greentea cheesecake a while back in their chinatown store but they discovered they no longer made it the workers are real nice and told me they only made greentea in this store now i should have asked it was permanent flavor or seasonal but i assumed it was permanent i didnt buy anything but i shall be back very soon to load up
three things ive learned from eating here and from friends avoid the typical stuff like pad thai noodle dishes avoid most of the lunch specials a bunch of dishes are offered and the quality just isnt that avoid chicken dishesthat being said this is one of my favorite thai places the service is friendly and the isan food is great if you know what to get some of my favoritespapaya salad som tum both the som tum thai with dried shrimp and peanuts and the som tum poo plara with preserved crab and pickled fish are delicious though the latter is more pungently flavorful i love spicy food but this papaya salad is too beast for me everything at the bottom soaks up that fiery vibrant marinade so the closer you get to finishing the more it burns i always have to remind myself to go pansy mode and get this mild the few times ive forgotten have been heaven and hell all at oncespicy ground meat salad larb i always get this with crispy pork moo krob and wrap it in the various veggies they provide larb is listed as with ground meat but this is just thinly cut slightly bigger pieces of meat the vinegary sour and sweet flavors go so well with the crunch in this dishpad ped this comes with thai eggplant bell peppers basil and wild ginger in a spicy curry paste its nicely savory with a bit of sweetness i usually get it with catfish pla dook so i have to deal with the minefield of bones but it goes so well with the sauce i dont like eggplant but thai eggplant is an exception its small and green and the sliced pieces look a bit like okra but are way better i hate okra with every fiber of my being unless its in stewsauteed morning glory with fresh chili pukk boong fai dang such a good side dish i had it with crispy pork once and there was too much fattiness so now i get the simpler one but it never lacks flavor and a bit of spicespicy lemongrass soup tom yum with seafood so fragrant sour and the hot broth feels so comforting until the spiciness hits they put a good amount of shrimp squid and mussels insidefrog legs this is one of the first places i ever tried frog legs in i always get them with basil sauce they have a slight crunch on the outside but are tender inside ive tried the version with garlic sauce which is okay but much milder i doubt id choose it again over the basil saucemake sure to get sticky rice its a great accompaniment for many of the entrees grab a small ball smooth it into a disk layer some meat and veggies in make a little wrap and enjoy their thai iced tea is a bit more sweet than id like but its good for washing down the spicinessive taken many people here i view it as a rite of passage for our friendship if you enjoy the food here well be just fine if you dont its probably better that we cut ties and go our separate ways
one of the best baguettes to grace a banh mi in terms of mouth feelthe lightly crisped thincrusted bread while still being soft on the inside did not shred my gums this was the best part most banh mi baguettes have really hard thick crusts while crisp and crunchy it will shred the roof of your mouth and gums i ordered this via and the sandwiches arrived still warm and crispy even with the below temps outside good job xe mayget the duke sandwich while is a lot for a banh mi the bread and meat combination works here the meat to bread ratio was on point not too much bread with an acceptable amount of meat its viet meatballs that taste like sweat and zesty mixed with savory corn beef hash mixed with the crispy veggies jalapenos and aromatic crispy bread this was a symphony of flavors and textures i also tried the classic sandwich and i suggest passing on itfor for viet ham and headcheese it doesnt taste any better than your banh mi besides having excellent bread plus they use the same zesty sauce in it as the duke imo the classic viet sandwiches need to have mayo and pate instead its good but i rather get it from another place
freshness rules here it is part a major part of what makes mimi chengs so good a really fresh dumpling is sublime thats what you can count on here it is nov the monthly special dumpling is drum roll pleasethanksgiving dinner dumplings de lish anyone visiting nyc come here try fresh dumplings any time of yearthe woman at the counter where i placed my order was very nice service with a smile ill be back for sure

eleven madison park was nothing short of magical the price may be a pain point for some especially if youre opting for the wine pairings but when youre devouring course after course the rest of the world comes to a complete halt and nothing else matters you sit there a fork in one hand and a knife in the other with an expression that can only be described as a stupid dumbfounded grin because in that moment you are not the you who strolls down fifth avenue with shopping bags in hand or the you who takes trips to europe to eat the best of what chefs around the world have to offer or even the you who works tirelessly to scrape up enough disposable income to treat yourself to a night out here in that moment you are part of the emp family and you will unquestionably be treated as such from the second you step into their doorsto get some of the logistics out of the way i came here on a friday night at with my mom to celebrate her birthday i called ahead of time to let the restaurant know the special occasion in addition to my aversion to cheese along with the tasting menu we opted for the wine pairings along with a tableside brewing of the high mountain oolong tea at the end of the meal in total the food came out to and change and the beverages an additional i just wanted to share my thoughts on a few different wine pairingswhile i enjoyed the wine pairings if i were to return i dont think id be getting it again the wines were interesting and they definitely paired well with the food that was presented but ultimately i dont think the varieties we were served justified the high cost a vast majority of the wines were french not really an issue just something to keep in mind if youre not the biggest fan of wines that taste earthy and heavily reflect the terroir of where the grapes were prolonging the emp experienceat the conclusion of the meal the restaurant gifted us a bag filled with a jar of housemade granola from that morning along with a cleverly designed menu of all the courses we tasted that night the menu itself is folded in the same tin can that the caviar course was presented in and was a nice touch compared to the plain paper menus that were handed out in the past in addition for my moms birthday they also included a large chocolate bar in her bag that she has yet to tableside teaat first i didnt think the price tag on a tableside experience would be worth whatever emp had in store thankfully i was proven wrong and i actually learned a great deal about the restaurants philosophies in brewing both tea and coffee along with some of the science and art behind a great cup of brewed tea the gaiwan set they used looked and felt amazing in its pure simplicity and the tea sommelier was kind enough to provide an extra steeping of the oolong as foodto quickly touch on the courses we were served that night black and white cookie with cheddar and apple b scallops with sea urchin scallop butter and scallop broth a caviar eggs benedict with smoked ham and sturgeon a foie gras marinated with squash and pumpkin seeds a poached halibut with turnip a mushroom tart with cremini and black truffle portobello a venison un croute with foie gras and civet b roasted carrot with buckwheat and mustard b baked potato with horseradish and bacon b instead of grilled cheese chocolate tuile with creme fraiche ice cream and cranberry a pearcranberry donut with mulled wine ice cream a chocolate covered pretzel apple brandy awhile emp didnt wow us with an impeccable menu suited to our exact taste buds course after course overall we had a sublime evening the granola they sent us home with is fantastic and im still very happy about the fact that we got to bring home the tin can with the emp insignia branded on the top i actually considered just taking it during the caviar course but decided against itreservations may be difficult to come by and try for and the price tag may be even more difficult to justify but given the chance i would do it all again in a heartbeat chef daniel humm has created not only a stunning innovative menu that will pique your interests throughout the meal but also an experience that you will cherish for years to come
i was a bit skeptical about this place both from their omakase business model and their controversial chef david bouhadana my visit to sushi by bou started inauspiciously with me falling down their metal stairs watch your step on those the hostess quickly ushered me inside bandaged me up and helped me with a lot of warmth that went beyond the typical coveryourass stuff she was sweet as pie and offered me a complimentary glass of sake as well as a discount on my mealthankfully my experience was only uphill from here sipping on a lovely oftenrefilled green tea and my sake which was refreshing and balanced i was treated to pieces of fish heres what i remember yellowtail two kinds of tuna salmon toro scallop uni ikura wagyuuni eelthe fish quality was uniformly very good a few stood out the uni which i dont always enjoy was creamy and sweet from santa barbara the toro was meltinyourmouth the scallops were pleasantly clean tasting set off by a nice burst of ashy garnish the eel at the end had the perfect caramelization i was also skeptical of their wagyuuni seems like throwing two rich buzzwordy ingredients together but it went together surprisingly well rice was also uniformly goodsome pieces had garnishes or sauces which were judicious with a couple of exceptions the sweet soy glaze on the yellowtail was too heavy and the yuzu on the salmon was spoiled by too big of a wasabi kickunfair to compare this to the sushi temples of new york but was head and shoulders above gourmetbudget options like sugarfish and kazunori its definitely punching above its weightit is a pretty quick pace and some of these were presliced for speed its super intimate with about seats its well decorated and theres a nice smell from the rice and blowtorching the staff was chatty and friendly i enjoyed talking with the bartender about his travels in japan after i finished up david wasnt working but i got to talk a bit with my sushi chef i always feel a little nervous about dining solo but they made me feel welcomereservations werent hard to come by for lunch i texted a day out but i would imagine youd need to plan further ahead for dinner they bill this as a pretheater option but this worked great for me as a quick lunch off the desk
i was looking for a fun festive place for my friends and i to celebrate a holiday dinner and came across havana central reservation was a breeze they tried their best to accommodate all our needs on a very busy holiday weekendthe extremely welcoming and friendly hostess sat our party immediately upon our reservation time we were given a great table and the best waiter ivan ivan kept us entertained and laughing all nightthe food was great we were all very happy with our entrees the highlights were thelobster stuffed avocado with plantains mashed yucca and thechurro ice cream bowlbest of all was the live music later in the night the musicians kept us all dancing in our seats my friends and i will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good food music and a fun festive friendly atmosphere

love this place i am finally writing a review after coming here for more than two dozen times to give them the credit they deserve they have clean and bright dinning room space is decently big for chinatown everything tastes great i pretty much had everything on their menu roast duckchickenpork congee wonton noodle rice rolls and of course the bao zai fan delicious satisfying and authentic the best part everything costs almost nothing nyc standard every time i come i end up ordering too much but without the guilt of hurting my wallet brought my parents visiting from china here for brunch one day and they approved as well

it is true that the increasing price of the menu is annoying but for now i consider contra one of my favorite restaurants in the city i find their tasting menu very unique and wellexecuted in the balance of flavor and creativity ive come here in a group for the regular menu back in when it was and recently again for the pricier but longer valentines day menu havent gotten the wine pairing so cant speak on that ordered a bottle and cocktails each time the bread is amazing as many have mentioned and probably my favorite bread ever i dont remember the specifics of the meal from last year but the highlight of this year was the blissfully buttery long island duck with leg fat wrapped in morels and the apple semifreddo with lemon meringue the cod was cooked perfectly as well i think both experiences started with an amuse bouche involving a chip or some sort which was crisped to perfection the main draw for me is how intentional all of the ingredients are and the fact that there are really not many dishes like them out therei will say the somm on valentines was not very good and recommended some wines incorrectly based on our specifications but we ended up happy with the bottle she picked i also found the last dessert too chocolate and moussey for my taste overall im still going to highly recommend contra to anyone looking for a michelin star experience and a different take on new american
as someone who went through a tesla obsession back in the day theres so much i love about this placethe accordianwalldoor of patent coffee that opens up to reveal the secret hallway to the speakeasy the interesting light fixtures the menu with experiment sketches and of course the fact that its in the radio wave building you feel like youre sitting where history was made as you sip on a cocktail our favorite was radio waves the cucumber tequilamezcal drink i also enjoyed the odd love nice to see some of the drinks incorporate patent coffee there are also some simple bar bites and sandwiches available the only slight downer was that i almost got stuck in the bathroom the door latch tends to get jammed and the second time i went i almost couldnt unlodge the latch ten minutes later i found my way out glad i had my phone and could wirelessly transmit distress signals to my friend or maybe it teslas experimental setups were still present in the vicinity i couldve used the dim vintage lights in the bathroom to send my sos message haha i know terrible reference but it had to be done
great quality ice cream i tried the ube it wasnt for me in large quantities but objectively it was good highly recommend it if you like the flavor it was full of ube flavor i instead got the mix of matcha and black sesame i loved it the soft serve was super creamy the flavors of both were well pronounced i coupled it with a chocolate cone which was a dollar extra the ice cream came out to be about not bad given the quality and quantity definitely can be shared i feel btw cc minimum is overall great ice cream
cozy dimly lit fun wine and whisky bar on stone street great selection of cocktails wines by the glass and small bites honoring robert burns month i ordered the fall of eve very tasty and blasphemous afterwards we savored some wine with various small bitessalmon tartar garlic shrimp fois gras with toast manchego camembert olives good cheerful spot on a cold winters night acoustics are a bit loud thus you will be screaming to be heard at some point cheers
huzzah ive finally found an ice cream parlor with a small enough ice cream cone for me to actually finish on my own yes i know that sounds absolutely ridiculous because who cant finish an ice cream cone by themselves but before you judge me let me first tell you something even more ridiculous so you can really properly judge me for the weirdo that i am i justreally dont like ice cream i know i know im sorry im this way guys but i just cant seem to ever get excited about ice cream halfway into a cone and im usually already regretting my decision and forcefeeding the rest of it to my boyfriendsisterwhoever else is in my vicinity thats why im so thankful for la newyorkina because i can actually finish their little bb cones and not have to face judgement by the rest of the ice cream loving worldnot only do they have the cutest little cones but they also have the most delicious mexican flavors like dont even get me started on their tres leche ice cream i mean i dont even really like ice cream and im all about their tres leche so that has to tell you something about how damn good it is now i cant say im ever really craving ice cream because i just dont do crazy things like that jokes but the next time i want to feel like a normal icecream loving human being you know where im going
i dont know if i got lucky for not but it looks that way as i was able to be seated immediately as there was only two of us that wanted to give this place a try from all of the raving fanseveryone greeted you that worked here regardless if they were your server or not policy for working there possibly it was cool and welcoming the atmosphere is dark and lit very dimly via lights and candlelights but was loud from the background music and clamor withinthe food did not disappoint i ordered the hot chicken sandwich with a left hand milk stout this might be the only spicy meal they got or the only one i was able to see in the dimly lit room but the spiciness is no joke i was sweating from it being unexpectedly kicking me the biscuit is really good that came with the food im not a big pickle guy and the pickles they served here made me reconsider if i liked them or not well done i guess i now ask myself if i really dislike pickles or not until next time i guess i will find out
came here on the recomendation of a friend and it did not disappoint first up this place can be confusing because there are two topaz places next to each other this is for the noodle bar next this place is kind of small even for a hole in the wall so we made a reservation which made us getting a table for really easy missed out on the check in offer for the lychee mimosa but i still enjoyed my meal with a thai ice tea in a huge glass and a chang beer as for food i had a pad thai shrimp whmich was delicious along with the coconut milk soup the pad thai is definitely in the top for pad thai dishes i have ever had it was also a huge portions but i was able to take it home i also want to comment on the service here definitely stars there was even an incident i witnessed where a lady ordered to go and then preceded to demand a table so she could eat her meal there when denied the customer wanted to cancel her order and then order a whole new dish from the menu i felt terrible for the staff to have to deal with this i know some people order to go and then eat there but this place is not one of those fast food places where that is aceptable overall good food great service one of my new favorite thai places in nyc
all across the isle manhattan tourists and natives alike forge claims about the best slice of pizza the citys love for a classic new york style pizza pie is centripetal to understanding manhattans food culture and perhaps equally important is how a persons favorite slice can narrowly define their love for a particular time place person or memory in their lifeits worth noting that someones claim for their favorite pizza can be tinted with marinaracolored glasses just because your uncle frankie took you to your favorite pizza spot when you were nine and taught you raunchy jokes every other sunday because your parents needed a break doesnt mean the slice at that pizzeria is the ultimate best but it also doesnt mean your love for that slice is any less valid we all have an uncle frankie and we all have parents who more or less didnt want to deal with us so if the pizza shrouding that nice memory in your life is also wearing a crown that reads best pizza in manhattan then all the power to youregardless of uncle frankies what im getting at here is that someones favorite pizza slice may be incredible to them via sentimentality but the slice might not be incredible objectively i believe theres no such thing as a truly bad slice of pizza but theres definitely a difference between okay pizza great pizza and pizza that takes words out of your mouth wakes you up in the middle of the night when your subconscious remembers it and forces you to go back to the pizzeria the next day when its doors openlets get to the gravy here pizza suprema as you may have guessed from the dissertation preceding this i was told by someone that pizza suprema is their favorite favorite is a strong word and not a word i toss around but definitely a word ill explore when given the opportunitythe array of pizza toppings and pie variations is almost as astounding as pizza supremas oldfashioned cash register both of which are not nearly as astounding as the fullness in which the pizza lives up to the word favorite i sampled slices of plain and sicilian to get a foundational understanding of pizza supremas overall taste and style i ate both slices at an exorbitantly slow pace and enjoyed every morsel of tomato cheese and ultrathin crust words taken nightwoken plotting to go againedward hopper never used a pizzeria as a subject in his paintings of stoic american life but if he did pizza suprema would be his muse more welcoming than midtown pretends to be coppertoned and filled with isolated moments saturated with narrative suggestion a hopper painting of pizza suprema would sell at christies for easy you can feel nostalgia resting in the rows of booths hear jokes told to kids given away for the day and breathe pure pizzeria redolence as you experience an amalgam of delicious slices waiting to be claimed as your favoritewhere there is an absence there is also a need but in the case of new york city the surplus of pizza doesnt mean we need less pizza in fact the more pizzerias the better every brick oven white paper plate fading into translucence with grease pile of cornmeal owner with an accent thicker than sicilian crust and pizzainspired smile as fluid as the viscosity of the hudson offers an opportunity for someone to create a new moment of nostalgia to revisit one day with their old favorite slice
i usually dont go this far into battery park but i was accompanying a friend her ex coworkers going away party this was a pleasant surprise to try somewhere new and with good company although we didnt plan to stay long it was a really fun and chill evening the space here has an upstairs area but that night we were here it was closed for a private event we all were able to find space by the bar pretty easily as there are a lot of side tables and bartenders working at the bar the prices were decent and service is also pretty good the music was fun and some people were dancing though there is no official dance floor this is not really a club but just a long bar with pretty scenery there are also a lot of televisions if you would like to watch one of the games you get a great view of the water and statue of liberty i would love to come back and check out the space upstairs sometime
thank you for bringing such a great omakase experience to my neighborhood came here the week it opened to beat the rush and im so glad i didwhere its located kinda creeps me out i dont like to be around funeral homes etc but once youre inside youll see that the space is beautiful and modern taking over a previous club space juku has three different floors main floor serves izakaya floor is the omakase counter and in the basement they are currently working on a loungeprivate space cant waitduring our visit they had two options a piece for and handroll for seems like their website now says that the prices vary based on market pricing so tbd i guess to try everything we opted for the larger omakase to start the meal i also got the cutest cocktail called big wets sugoiii tikicame in an adorable buddha shaped tiki cup haha all the cocktails looked delicious all paired with some kind of japanese flavors yuzu sake shiso sesame japanese whiskey etc we got the pieces belowstriped jacksoy marinated blue fin tunagolden eye snappertasmanian king salmonscallop from hokkaido with smoked salt and lemon juicechopped horse mackerel with ginger and scallions this is chef yoshidas favorite piece if i overheard correctly hahaforgot to label piece snow crabseared japanese barracudababy sardinebotan shrimp with dried fish eggsea eelotoro literally puts a piece of toro on toro dbig eye snapperuni from hokkaidotuna handrollmy favoritesto end the meal some super yummy tamago its more like a sponge cake tamagoamazing and a light yuzu sakei like how delicate their pieces are seasoned perfectly and with perfect rice consistency that is slightly warm but note that these pieces are smaller than most omakase places out there i would say probably of the size forget the chopsticks just use your hands they actually also offer a uni sampler that you can tack on at the end of different types of uni including a fermented one we wanted to add it but the chef advised against it as we already got the omakase and tried the best uni they had that day already next time thoughwill perhaps try the smaller omakase combined with the uni samplerjuku gives a lot of bang for your buck at this price point in nyc so take advantage they are available for reservations under resy thanks to chef kei for an amazing meal doesnt seem like either of the chefs are involved with anymore i dont even think they serve omakase anymore

as good as it gets i love donuts and have a donut problem ill be the first to admit itbefore i ever stopped in to grab some goodness i knew the donut pub was doing something right because ive heard more than a few people rave about this place what appeals to me is the real nyc flavuh this shop has its probably been around forever and the people who work here arent hipster scum eitherthe actual donut i had was amazing i went with the cronut at around knowing that there was a chance it might be stale but it was as fresh as it would be at any other time of the day it was moist and fluffy and had a nice sugary glaze i devoured itignore the negative reviews on here as they seem to have been written by hipster donut snobs nothings wrong with this place ill be be back and recommend you give them a try
two words vegan mexican i honestly wasnt sure what to expect for an all vegan mexican restaurant everything i love about mexican food is centered around meat on top of that vegan alternatives can be super hit or miss thankfully it was a definite hit on their part first of all the smell upon entering this place is absolutely mouthwatering the staff are accommodating welcoming and check up on you regularly which is always nice as for the food i was blown away my friend and i ordered their vegan nachos and cocktails to start i tried the matcha y coconut very sweet and refreshing and my friend got their margarita extremely sweet but still so good the nachos were stupid good topped with this amazing vegan cheese meat and mountain of guacamole like i can die happy we both ordered fish tacos which we werent sure how we felt about vegan fish the fish is a cucumberlike veggie that was breaded it was okay but i wish i had tried something else on the menu that wasnt trying to mock fish overall i cannot wait to be back they also have a smaller shop connected to the restaurant if you want to order togo
the ramen here delivers the inhouse made springy noodles with perfect texture and thickness in creamy rich but not too heavy tonkatsu broth were exactly what i needed on this cold winter nightthe veggies were balanced the thinly sliced spring onions were delicate and did not overwhelm the broth the two pieces of chili oil bamboo shoots were a good addition as well the thin slices of pork added a refined feel to the dish though i personally prefer fatty carmelized pork chunks the egg came out perfectly soft boiled and beautifully placed they care about the artistry and execution of their ramenthe brooklyn kura was nice it was on the sweeter side and but thoroughly enjoyable topped off with some hibiki whiskey a perfect end to a perfect meal the servers were also very friendly and easy to chat with loved the vibe and the experience here my list of favorite manhattan ramen places are totto ramen hearty rich chunky tonchin for vibe ramen price ippudo refined ramen but a little too snooty and the wait is jin ramen not amazing but conveniently close to my apartment
omars has saved my life plenty of late dinners in the office ive found that mediterranean food is perfect for working light enough to keep you from feeling sleepy while substantive enough to power you through as i dont drink coffee and will otherwise eat all of the candy to stay awake ive only gotten delivery so i cant say what the restaurant dining experience is like but my foods always been on time and kept relatively warm my goto orders eggplant salad with extra pita bread theres a fair amount of lemon and tahini just the way i like it vegetarian platter theres usually way too much food for one sitting and for one person but even if i inhale the whole thing i dont feel absolutely disgusting its for about two meals worth of food you get falafel hummus baba ganoush and pita bread their hummus is one of the best ive ever had chicken shawarma i was a little suspicious that the chicken would be dry and tough after i forgot about my order and left it sitting for half an hour but it turned out delicious they give you a heaping mountain of meat baklava a small piece complimentary with each order such a nice touch and it never fails to make me smile this one hot sauce they have after practically wrenching the little tub inside out to get every last drop ive learned to ask for extra thanks omars youre awesome the crazy lunchtime lines should speak volumes about how consistently good this place is

coffee coffee everywhere this place has some of the best coffee and coffee beans in the neighborhood all reasonably priced definitely a worth visit for all coffee lovers they have different types of coffee beans from many countries all labeled they also carry many unique items such as different types of coffee presses filters mugs post cards jars drip kettles vintage coffee grinders chocolates etc the customer service is also very professionali especially like the lady who serve in the morning during the weekdays because she is very efficient at what she does remember to pick up a punch card when you purchase a drinkfree drink after every drink purchases and each drink comes with a piece of chocolate if they dont give you the chocolate just askalso this is a walk in and go spot so no seatings available inside however there are two benches outside for some good vibe people watching if desired

i took my first class today and im totally a fan jen housek is a super great instructorloves instructor jen is friendly provides clear instruction with modifications and has such positive energy i have to reiterate how important instruction with modifications is in barre classes given the isolated movements and jen does a fantastic job of instructing all levels workout ive taken classes at pop physique pure barre and bar method and i honestly think this is the best one barre classes work only if you do the sets with the right technique and once again jen was great at explaining this facilities is this the cleanest studio or what in nyc honestly its spotless and feels new even though its been open for two years already i was skeptical of carpet at first but i enjoy it better than cheap studio mats amenities theyve thought a lot through with double shower curtains showers caps hair brushes lockers of varying sizes even a hair straightener im impressedso yeah im a fan would recommend
if you want to cradle your face in the sensation of silk and pamper your senses with luxurious essential oils such as pettigrain and rose then make certain you try the new skincare line here i wouldnt have thought that the white company known for its high end luxury linens and homeware could have introduced a skin care line that would marry affordability and performance but pairing with the powerhouse deciem known in the uk for its advanced technology in skincare proved to be a smart investment for the white company and the consumer the packaging is simple and clean with only five items that work for all skin types of course not every product is perfect for every type of skin but as an example there is certainly one product of the five than can work for even very acneic skin such as the eye revitalize ill give a brief review of the items in the five star line the cleanser is a creamy one that becomes oil as you massage it in leaving the skin clean without stripping your natural oils it doubles as a makeup remover too the aroma is gorgeous a mix of several essential oils including bergamot bitter orange oil and rose and vetiver inhale deeply for the fragrance is just faintly evocative enough to tease you to serenity and not overpowering all women and men can embrace this line without transforming into a heavily perfumed granny from the serum is chock full of good stuff like grape stem cells amino acids hyaluronic acids i smeared this serum over my forehead and could have sworn that my face had an instant facelift it plumped my forehead up so much the eyebrow area got lifted yes i did use a generous amount but i hadnt expected to be this pleasantly surprised by the effects and the plus you can use this over the eye area too want an eye cream but afraid of heavy globs clogging up the under eye area this eye cream has the consistency of a gel and penetrates quickly if your skin is on the drier or normal side by all means buy the night oil it was one of my faves the lightest face oil ive ever used and scented with what i thought was neroli they told me pettigrain theyre from different part of the same plant by the way citrus auruntium or the bitter orange the pretty scent is also a stress buster i have dry skin and the oil was so smooth upon application it felt as if my fingers were ice skating over my skin i could smell and smooth it on my skin day and night if your skin is dry i suggest you do and lastly is the advanced hydration a moisturizer that rebalances your skin all the textures are light as if your fingers are skimming velvet and silk when you apply the products and the great thing and true surprise about it all besides being non animal testedvery important to me and made without parabens nothing in the line is over if i remember correctly they source directly and saving middleman expenses means the consumer saves they keep the packaging simple so youre not paying for that expensive container so nestled in the high end and higher priced products of this company is a well priced skin care line that the average person can afford and should definitely try i havent been this excited about a skin care line in a whilethe store is absolutely beautiful with different sections showcasing different bed and bath items like fluffy chenille pillows robes you want to never take off other types of clothing like dresses and cashmere sweaters being a tactile person i restrained myself but the hand feel of everything here tempts you to touch and squeezethey have scented candles body lotions towels etc white is the theme here so youll find white plates cups etc its called the white company folks white linens are of course what the white company started out with and youll find plenty of white sheets some with delicate grey embroidery you could sigh over cover your bed with some of the sheets and duvets and you might never leave it as you dream of finding your sugar daddy or sugar momma if youre already making the big bucks to afford this stuff call in sick and do a sleepover the salespeople here are gracious without being intrusive they wont stalk you until you buy i actually spoke to the owner chrissie and jessica the manager both so warm i was inspired to give them a terrific yelp review after using the products and realizing they workno yelpers i wasnt bribednot with sheets or what i cant resist chocolate they didnt have packaged samples of the skin care line when i was in but do have little jars they can pump from the testers to give you i was told they do christmas in a big way here so do come by around for holiday cheer im not expecting to see baby jesus swaddled in a down duvet but perhaps song and mead its for certain you can find nice skin care products here amongst other lovely items and your presents will not be regifted i guarantee you

majorelle is housed in what was formerly the iconic nyc post steakhouse at the lowell hotel the entire interior was redone in brightly painted exquisite wooden panels and plenty of marble juxtaposed the wood the food was outrageously delicious from hors doeuvres to the desserts i was especially partial to the whole roasted chicken which i hope is on the regular menu the staff was amazing and i couldnt find fault despite my best effort to do so i attended a private event and didnt have the opportunity to try the restaurants normal service ill be swinging by again soon because my first experience with majorelle left a positive and lasting impression
red bean custard matcha oh my my crew and i came down here after a huge dinner uptown in search of something to satisfy our sweet tooth and end our night of gluttony right i learned of taiyak through yelp with their weeklong bogo event and since ive never been lucky enough to try a croyaki my intrigue superceded my growing waistline and i decided to make up for my overindulgences the following day in the gym and give into my momentary satisfaction with some custard filled fishshaped croissantswhen we pulled up i was worried because they were packed but upon closer inspection realised everyone inside was already enjoying their tasty treats upon entry the very pleasant staff explained how the bogo deal worked and we each ordered one of each croyaki one custard and one red bean i also indulged in a red bean and matcha ice cream for the drive homeall the yums the croyaki is warm and crusty on the outside with a creamy pocket of slightly sweet custard inside it is soooo good simple but tasty my matcha ice cream was creamy also it tasted just like a green tea kit kat and the strawberry drizzle on top is a perfect addition and then when youve finished the ice cream theres a red bean treat at the bottom of your fishshaped cone i loved the mini skewer of gummi candies also the whole thing is a cute and whimsical treat worthy of eating ice cream in the winter for i still have my red bean croyaki ill be toasting up to nosh later onhappy to have tried this place and glad to know theyre so close to our regular dim sum haunt definitely a future after dim sum brunch visit
i absolutely love love love this little tiny spot on macdougal i make it a priority to stop by no matter how many times a week i may be in the neighborhood believe me when i say i have never had a bad crepe from here and i have pretty much tried most of them all every crepe i have had has always been delicious from the first to the last bitethe staff is very pleasant and they provide speedy service which is a plus the prices are pretty decent as well however it is a little unfortunate that there are only just a few seats like i also pray that one day they will take card because the whole cash only thing gets a little annoying most time than others i never have cash on me and usually end up paying for my crepe with all the coins i scrape up from my car and the bottom of my purse
possibly the best new broadway show of the season the music is haunting at times enchanting and the performances captivating and touching katrina lenk the female lead is a true talentgifted she was wonderful recently in the play indecent seems that getting to play the part of a jewish girl is her regular gig her performance of omar sharif is captivating elevating the song to a domain beyond the composition itself there is no dancing in this play but her body movement is as if it is choreographed you also get to see tony shalhoub who is endearing isnt he always no one could play his role as well the stage sets are deceptively simple but clever and evoke a mood that works well with the narrative the musical is based on a israeli film of the same name an egyptian police band mistakenly winds up in a small middle of nowhere negev desert village instead of a larger similar sounding town where they were going to perform with no transportation until the next day they spend the night with the locals the times review says it all a ravishing musical that whispers romance you would never guess it from the storyline but it really is about romance i pick my broadway shows carefully and im glad that i chose to see this one youll love the score the musicians and the other performers are great
ugh just so deliciousin nyc there are always so many new hyped up restaurants popping up all the time its difficult to decipher which ones are actually worth going to im always skeptical of celebrity restaurants because they are generally invariably disappointing however im a big fan of jgs other restaurants abc kitchencocina perry st and so i wanted to give public kitchen a try we came here for brunch and i was very pleased space is bright airy and very trendy in the back of a hotel with surrounding gardens we ordered the basilcorn gyoza smoked salmon latkes and the black truffle pizzacomplimentary bread stiff and flavorless thats okay though bread can be a huge plus but is not a dealbreaker for mebasilcorn gyoza delish usually i am against ordering vegetarian dishes tbh i kind of hate vegetables but this was worth it delicious and surprising the best combination of flavorssmoked salmon latkes tasty but nothing special basically tasted exactly how you might imagine given the price dishes have gotta be at least a little bit special would not order againblack truffle pizza yes yes a thousand times yes a thick cheesy chewy truffley gooey mm runny egg type of pizza so not for the thin crust purists warm and delicious perfect for breakfast large portion reasonably priced for nyc reservations needed service was quite slow however waited a long time for the food to come out and had to flag waiters down multiple times to get water the check etc still given the food ambiance and relative value i would definitely recommend jg has done it again
i adore japanese cheesecakes and the bouncy ones at this modern bakeshop doesnt disappoint they do indeed bounce jiggle boogie woogie to the beat so success on what they claim to dowe tried the original bouncy done in a steam bath for its signature soft and fluffy texture its delicate and crumbles nicely due to its high water content they dont taste particularly different from others ive had bearing close resemblance in the asian stratosphere to taiwanese cheesecake andor cotton cheesecakekekis is still extremely addictive and probably just as unforgiving calorically dont let its lightness fool you like with most things asian its a fat kid at heart

omakase for pieces sign me upsimilar concept as sushi on jones but better higher quality of fish more interaction with sushi chef and intimate environment a lot of cocktail sake options favorite pieces were torched toro botan shrimp wagyuni of course and the handroll addons overall fish was very very fresh and texture was amazing no soy sauce needed as the pieces come with appropriate sauces our sushi chef was cordial and careful in explaining all the pieces we tried dinosaur and i were contemplating whether we should spoil ourselves extra by ordering handrolls and we are sooo glad we did we tried the toro and hamachi and both were very good definitely would visit again for the price and quality you cannot get a better deal especially in the city located in the basement of sanctuary hotel on street accepts reservation by text only min grace period so dont be late this location is right in the heart of times square which means lots of traffic and tourists
i came here with my boyfriends family last weekend for his birthday we tried to book online and call ahead on the day of but they said to just show upi came in around on sunday and was told a minute wait the guy was kind of vague and apathetic the place was pretty busy however he said we could sit at the bar which we did once his family arrived minutes laterthe bartender was super helpful and explained that we could order our food at the bar and get it moved to our table as long as we closed out there we put in our seafood orders and started with a round of a dozen and a half happy hour oysters happy hour runs all day on sunday and includes dollar oysters these are not the most knockyoursocksoff oysters of your life but they were balanced and juicy im kind of picky about my oysters and i would have kept eating these forever big crowd pleasersour table was ready after about minutes so we closed out and switched over then we got our bibs and gloves and suited up our food came out in about minutesmy boyfriend and i focused on the king crab legs mp i think it was a pound in mild lemon pepper awesome the snow crab legs and shrimp were also good in medium claw daddys special both of them came with potatoes and corn in the bag we also had a round of clams that were pretty good as well as crab cake fritters that were much better than expected garlic noodles are not what i expect at a cajun spot but they were tasty and would be a welcome addition if youre trying to fill upthey warn you about the spice here but even the medium i tried wasnt very spicy the king crab was our best choice as well as the medium claw daddys special sauce do note that they dont serve crawfish in decemberthe only other seafood boil spot ive been to in new york was hot n juicy which had slightly better sauces however the atmosphere is just so far ahead at claw daddys youre in a modern light filled space and it feels much more fun than being in a basement sports bar service was excellent bathrooms were cleanif youre looking to eat a lot of seafood claw daddys is a great choice do reserve if you can and do try to take advantage of the happy hour
its easy to overlook writing a review for a staple place i enjoy going to when the restaurants in nyc seem to be endless but i have been coming here for years and was reminded on a night out with my friends why i love coming here so muchi was with a group of girls so we were a large party our waiter was superb super friendly and helpful we ordered family style and helped me to order enough of everything so we could all share every dish they were great at getting drinks out to everyone consistently and even brought us complimentary desserts and shots every time i have been there though the food and service is constantly consistent and thats why it deserves stars
i am in love with fat cat as a person who doesnt party this place checks off all the boxes for me its low key casual and an overall pleasure for drinkers and nondrinkers alike the bar area is filled with eclectic doodads and a nice selection of beers and wines the majority of the space is filled with a hodgepodge of games that include shuffleboard pool and ping pong on weekdays games are per person on weekends it is per person board games go per game not only can you have tons of fun but the cherry on top are no doubt the live music shows the band area is surrounded by vintage velvety and moody sofas perfect for chilling with a cool beer my friends and i had the pleasure of hearing a jazz ensemble on thursday night and were thoroughly entranced by the ambiance pool tables are in fairly good condition with a select amount of nice cue sticks lined across the walls tables are reserved via ticket numbers id highly recommend getting your ticket as soon as you come in as we ended up waiting a while before our pool table was available in all a wonderful place to go for a casual drink and a game of pool or ping pong ill definitely be back
my gfs and i love mexican food so for our dinner date a few fridays ago we decided to go to this little hidden gem btw its byob woohoothe atmosphere is very intimate and cozythe food was so fresh and tasty everything was made correctly and was simply perfect we started with chips and guacamole which was really good and flavorfulour entres were chicken quesadilla red sauce enchilada and green sauce enchilada which came with rice and beansthe red sauce is suppose to be a bit more spicy then the green however it was not too spicy at all it had just enough kick to it and i felt was more flavorful then the green sauce the green sauce was also great but a little more on the tangy sidethe food here was great you can tell it was all freshly made and not frozen fast food quality overall it was a great night wine great food and wonderful servicethis was a mexican food experience the way its suppose to be
i first stumbled into char sue several weeks prior and had the chance to sample an array of their small plates and appetizers which are ideal for any happy hour get together i can still remember how flavorful and wellencased in an egg roll shell the black pepper beef tacos were and the seasoning and spice that were layered in the five spice duck wings needless to say when the opportunity came to revisit char sue for a five course dinner menu i immediately said yesthe restaurant is conveniently located just steps away from the delanceyessex stop in the les and is set up for diners and groups of all sizes looking to just grab a quick bite take a seat at the bar or one of the two tops to the side hoping to have a group of friends and family theres a communal table thatll seat everyone at once as well it works for almost any occasion and the food alone is deserving of a special visitdinner began with a new menu addition monkey bread served a top a slice of sweet potato in a thai green curry the bread is a family recipe compliments of chef matty rojas and is soft and pillowy with no small amount of butter perfect for getting that slight crisp at the bottom of the bed its the perfect vehicle for scooping up the spicy and creamy curry and contrasts well with the sweetness of the sweet potato the following dish isnt unfortunately on the permanent menu but if i had my way it would be tender succulent slices of octopus were served with charred brussels sprouts and paired with a spicy pennywort vinaigrette the flavors were reminiscent of the yu xiang È±ºÈ¶ô sauce that ive grown up eating and was the perfect savoryspicy flavor for the proteinnext up crispy pork belly no other words are really necessary but i did my best to savor each of the three pieces that were served they had a crisp crunchy crust that yielded to a tender and fatty interior and was highlighted even more with the side of a garlicchili dipping sauce it ties with the char sue duck as my favorite dish of the night but how can you compare to a plate of decadent dryaged roast duck coated in a blend of sichuan spices a crisp crackling skin tender and juicy white meat all served a top of bed of warm sushi rice this would easily be my last meal if i ever had to choose one and is more than successful as a modern elevated take on the traditional peking duckto finish a sweet almond pudding with a strawberry jam provided the ideal light finish to the meal and also cemented my desire to camp outside their kitchens for the remainder of my time you think im joking im notim already planning a return visit to char sue and would recommend it to anyone looking for a uniquely nyc restaurant here asian food is redone and reinvented to even better and more delicious forms but still stay true to their core flavors and tastes and truly you wont find these dishes anywhere else
lots of love for zabars although on the east side we are allowed to call him eliwe were on the uws and trying to decide what to have for dinner and then we saw zabars and problem solved the shop was buzzing with activity all sorts of unique foods scattered around their cheese selection is crazy big with free samples their desserts look really good the real stand out is their smoked fish we had their pastrami lox and gravlax with dill sauce both were amazing the bagels were fresh and the babka was as good as the one we get from russ and daughter the service is at a relaxed pace but i think that is because they take great care in what they are doingwe would definitely come back and maybe call him eli

this tranquil sister museum of the met is a wonderful standalone gem new yorkers love to suggest to visiting friends tired of the same old siteswhether or not youre a fan of medieval art the gardens alone are worth a visit suggested donation people there are also some nice vistas from the promontory overlooking the hudsonthe tapestries murals and other artifacts are worth a look for sure perhaps even a leisurely stroll through the galleriesi wont be a jerk by taking a point off for the cafe but strangely enough that was part of our reason for visiting for such a cool museum the options are very sparse and the prices unconscionably high they did however have an abbey ale that was perfect for the venue and soon quelled my churlish mutteringsps we were with strollerwielding friends the museum is not particularly strolleraccessible but you can get around

we were at boucherie sunday evening for dinner all i can say is wow first of all the restaurant itself is gorgeous black and white tiles and huge antique mirrors really you could be in paris we had reservations and were greeted like long lost friendsthe wait staff and hostess were all highly efficient and gracious and they deserve stars we each had a glass of wine selected by our server and julie ordered a corpse reviver ii after seeing a selection of absinthe based cocktails she said it was the best she has had in new york we just had wines by the glass but the wine list looked pretty good with lots of bottles under julie had moules as an appetizer there was a huge pile of them that came prepared with bacon mushrooms in a very light cream sauce they had a slightly smoky taste and were fabulous i had a really nice caesar salad i know in such a traditional french restaurant we should have been more adventuresome but we both couldnt resist the steak frites see my pictures the presentation was wonderful and the taste and quality of the steak were fantastic our tab for of steak frites and an apple tart served with vanilla icecream came to just over with tax a really good deal for dinner on a beautiful summers evening in the west village we both loved this place and will return soon
it took me over a week to get my wits together to write this review because i blacked out after eating the fontina egg sandwichthe fontina egg sandwich caused temporary blindness made me see stars took my speech and for a brief moment i couldnt hear anything other than my beating heart and even that was reduced to what hamster feet sound like on a wheel tiny hardly audible rhythms running into endless obliviontraditionally served on a toasted roll dusted with sesame seeds the fontina egg sandwich is layered with greens pesto garlic and optional bacon is bacon truly optional because i have no time for greens i requested they be put directly in the trash the welcome excess of fontina cheese a perfectly oozy egg and homemade pesto on that lightly crisped roll is almost too much to remember in detail because i fear i might pass out from its absence in my life at this moment along with this heavensent sandwich were ten fried yukon potatoes the size of grenades that god himself expressshipped to vicsto answer all the questions you may have yes i can write an entire review about a sandwich no ive never had a better breakfastthemed sandwich ever yes this review is very extra no this review is not hype
i love this place first at all the owner is there and he is so friendly he will make sure you enjoy your food either you eat there or for take out this was my bowl base white rice protein raw tuna and salmon mix in cucumber cilantro hiziki seaweed and edamame sauce red pok√© toppings seaweed salad toasted seaweed and masago and for the crunchiness i added some almonds sesame seeds and crispy garlic and voil√° my perfect dish i must say the sauce i added has wasabi taste im not a big fan of wasabi but good for trying this timeive tried in other places the pok√© bowl but this is one is the winner for me i like the ambiance its very important for me its big enough to find a table and enjoy your meal the product is fresh and the service is fast and friendlyfor ordering you have to get the paper and check the ingredients to make your own bowl even though they have options for you already mustgo really recommend this place you wont regret it
when it first opened √±a√±o was tasty but service was a bit on the slower side as its a small restaurant with maybe tables total or less when pushed together theres really only one person running the ship in the frontofthehouse which i believe is the owner as a new restaurant on avenue im sure it needed to find its place and that it did i went back to √±a√±o last week and the food drinks service the prices and well basically everything was outstanding as a latin restaurant serving what appears to be authentic ecuadorian cuisine there is nothing like it around we tried cocktails made with ecuadorian aguardiente aka firewater which is a alcohol proof hard liquor made of up sugar cane i tried the cholita which is the aguardiente with naranjilla juice naranjilla is a sour fruit grown in the north of ecuador kinda tastes like kiwipassion fruit triple sec amaretto and a berry puree which i loved my friend had the galapagos also made with the aguardiente mixed with blueberries blue cara√ßao and a splash of seltzer and lemon juice now to the foodfor appetizers we started with encocado de camaron cups made of green plantain filled with a shrimp and coconut stewfor entrees we tried the seco de pollo a spicy and sour chicken marinated in cilantro and the juice of the naranjilla i mentioned earlier usually it is served with yellow rice and sweet plantains but i subbed for a green salad which came with red and yellow beets chaulafan pork fried rice saut√©ed with edamame andean corn soy sauce scallions and cilantro it also came with a few sweet plantains on the side all in all everything was great there were so many other options on the menu we wanted to try and i look forward to coming back again soon
if you have not yet been to domodomo get your head out of the sand and hop on a train to get downtown now this sushi restaurant is my very favorite in all of nyc its definitely fun to do an omokase or a domokase but theres nothing wrong with picking a ton of your favorites from the menu and watching them make each one in front of you im getting a little pavlovian saliva in my mouth just from thinking about this place the prawn uni uni wagyu really theres no pieces that you can go wrong with i love the uni pasta im a bit of an uniholic and this place definitely has some of the freshest uni in all of nyc do you think that paragraph was the most used instances of the word uni on yelp im going to win an award for talking about uni too much tears roll down face as i accept this award with a giant grinanyway back to the gold domodomo not only is the food amazing and not just your run of the mill average fresh sushi its extremely creative the ambiance is superb it feels like a cross between a super trendy spot and a super fancy spot but with nice comfy prices that dont make you have a heart attacki think im going to make a reservation right now for later this week good talk thanks
if you want to know what heaven tastes like you come here dont forget to bring all that money you saved up for a new insert item you really want here because its gonna cost you a pretty penny dined in for brunch with my friends because my foodie friend told me this place is to die for i trust her opinions we all looked at the menu astonished because we didnt think wed be paying for an asparagus omelette i opted for the orange bennett to drink because what brunch is complete without alcohol and of course the asparagus omelettebefore they provide you with your entrees they serve up some bread with butter and olives i dont know why but that bread was delicious im so glad we asked for more the orange bennett was a bit zesty and the perfect hangover cure better than a mimosa this drink goes down smoothly and most importantly tastes like orange juice i could have mistaken this for a moscato dupe hahaasparagus omelette was by far interesting and delicious it was slightly undercooked inside but tasted like a fluffy egg with some sort of cream in every bite a definite musthave oh and because you cant end a meal without dessert we opted for the espresso chocolate cake which btw does not have nuts in it every bite melted in your mouth it was the perfect middle between sweet and bitter everything from the spongelike cake texture soft and moist to the creamy icing made me only wish i could eat it everyday one of the best brunches ive had this far try it for yourself and make reservations

the itinerary for the evening was to hog on some ramen at a nearby popular ramen joint and come here to try out this new trending old dessert placeso glad we came here and tried out the cruffs its essentially ice cream sandwiched between warm soft glazed donuts ive tried donut icecream sandwiches at another midtown shop before but they didnt feel so soft and fresh the donuts here are so soft and porous that the melting icecream seeps beautifully into them youd think that would make the donuts mushy but it doesnt we tried the cruffs with flavors thai ice tea and lychee with toppings almonds and mochi mochi was a free topping courtesy yelp checkin they also offer milk shakes and ice cream scoops but coming here and not ordering the cruffs would be blasphemy

boozy brunch muy buenocalle ocho is one of the best brunch spots in nyc especially if you are going with a large group the prices may seem high at first but it comes with unlimited sangria so it is actually a very good dealwhen coming into this hotel restaurant it has a nice dimly lit ambience and with a lot of tables when we sat down we ordered drinks right away and i am not going to review all of them because they are all delicious the one i will mention is the havana banana coconut rum cr√®me de banana coconut lychees this just had so many unique sweet flavors they make it definitely worth getting the drinks do stop once you stop orderingeating food so make sure to order a desert for the table at the end to keep them flowingfrom a food standpoint i would recommend the gallitos serves twoplatter of traditional costa rican soft tacos scrambled eggs chorizo lettuce pico de gallo avocado salad calle ocho home fries it was all delicious especially the chorizo and this gives you really everything from a food standpoint and solid portion for two people but all the food here is good you can not go wrongin short book brunch here now what are you waiting for unlimited sangria with brunch delicious food and drinks great waitstaff
the omakase experience at sushi kaito definitely reminded me of the omakase meals i had in japan my friend scored a sunday seating and the experience from start to finish was amazing we opted for the piece omakase meal for they also offer a piece omakase meal for if youre feeling hungry for it both seatings are and start exactly on time so dont be late the master chef was an adorable old man who was very knowledgeable and friendly every piece he made was delicious fresh and flavorful it just melts in your mouth and no fishy taste at all my party was full at the end of the omakase but we opted to order a la carte just to see what else he had this place is worth a try and the price includes tip and tax
im definitely not a steakhouse connoisseur by any means i know the greats lugers wolfgangs smith and wollensky but thats only because everyone knows those names im pretty sure i couldnt tell you the difference between a prime rib at capital grille versus the same cut at wolfgangs my boyfriend on the other hand loves his meat theres nothing that lights up his face more than cutting into a bloody slab absolutely nothing including me so for his birthday this year i picked keens the reviews looked good the prices were on the margin of affordable for a steakhouse and the neat new york past spoke to my inner history nerd hello clay pipes stacked precariously along the ceilings the famous mutton chop devoured by lillie langtry who took keens to court for not admitting women yes please first there are several different parts of keens we accidentally came in through the bar entrance and wandered confusedly until we finally came to the main waiting area theres a first floor second floor and third floor tables and groups of all sizes second a reservation is definitely a must for weekend dinners we came on the earlier side and by the time we left there was already a line third everything we ordered was amazing they give you free bread and cruditedip the bread while not the best house bread was at least toasted my boyfriend got the prime rib i got the lobster salad and we ordered the creamed spinach mushrooms and mashed potatoes to share now let me be clear that prime rib was heavenly even better than my lobster salad it needed no salt or steak sauce while im on the topic of salt keens includes a blurb on the menu that says you can ask them to tweak the salt level but only for certain dishes it came with a garlic and horseradish sauce but i preferred the meat without the bliss on my boyfriends face was over at this point holy crap the sides i was a bit skeptical about the creamed spinach but that was the one i ended up liking the most mashed potatoes were fine saut√©ed mushrooms came out a little too oily but i ate embarrassing portions of it nonetheless even though we were hurting at this point we ordered the butterscotch sundae we practically cleaned the bowl and then waddled out of there clutching our bellies definitely a fantastic meal to combat the sunday scariesour waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and cheerfully promised to bring out a candle with the dessert
upon entering the well decorated entryway you are greeted pleasantly by a smiling hostess surrounded by autumnal hued interiors flowing into ultra high ceilings dim lights and exposed brick walls we were guided to the second dining area that complimented the first but with white table clothed tables intimate candle lit settings rounded out with piped in smooth jazz type vocals cooing remakes of modern pop tunes our server joseph pulled out his patience hat for the evening as he tried on several occasions to get us to order our courses timely we had so much catching up to do but finally took a moment to peruse our menus and start with our apps i had the soup of the day which was a comfortingly smooth cauliflower soup mercedess eggplant timbale with a thinly veiled b√©chamel sauce was unexpectedly fragrant and heartyi followed mercedess lead as i wasnt in the mood for a heavy pasta or meat dish so i ordered the perfectly seared medium rare salmon atop spaghetti squash dotted with lightly seared grape tomatoes the salmon glistened and had a huge punch of buttery flavors a very satisfying and enjoyable meal if you happen to be meeting up with friends while in the yonkers area and looking for a spacious bar lounge with friendly and truly accommodating staff serving a decent array of modern italian fare zuppa restaurant and lounge may have what you need
ok i admit i made the reservation days ago at sharp by using the alarm otherwise i would not be able to secure a spot right at dinner time and i was informed as well it was going to be a longlasting one so well prepared myself with not too much food consumed at noonevery dish as expected was prepared with delicacy and kindness and you can directly taste it out using palate i especially enjoyed the duck and sea bass which supposed to be their main courses their special duck confit mixed with lychee was one my most remarkable experiencestowards the end of meal they will provide you the menu so you can remember exactly what was explored at this top notch restaurantdont know whether i will come back again here as we have so many choices in the city yet this is definitely some places you gotta try out if you are someone exotic
finally the answer to my food prayershere was my dilemma with los tacos no located in chelsea market on the one hand it offers one of the best meat tacos i have ever tasted other being velvet taco in chicago but the crowds at chelsea market are always insane i prefer to eat in a leisurely fashion and enjoy my food with good company rather than hunching over one tiny little space as hundreds of people rush past or gawk at you to finish faster so they can grab your spacenow i know that the pace of this new location might be due to how new it is to the location but i love the ambiance here the tacos are just as good you must get the carne asada and adobada but the pace is much more relaxed the music is bomb and fun the sauces just as ample mild medium and spicy dont forget to add everything to your tacos guac onions sauce and cilantro if you decide to add the spicy sauces to your tacos you can alleviate the fire bomb in your mouth by drinking their delicious offering horchatai gorged last time and got tacos my fiance got my only regret was that my stomach cant keep up with my appetite it is just so good trust me go and thank me later
as beautiful as the pictures look seating is limited but for now its not a super popular place so we were able to find seats at on sunday we got the rose latte light hint of rose i thought this was just ok lavender latte i really liked this very powerful seeds on top also chocolate and lavender cake this was good but id like to try the other ones very light fig chocolate truffle hint of fig cherry blossom chocolate truffle good
looking for great burgers and dont want to break the budget this is your placefood i got the chicken burger and added cheese and of course jalape√±os the chicken was perfectly moist and delicious they also offer lamb burgers which i feel are harder to find and still within a decent price range i think the best part is that their burger addons arent ridiculously priced cheese is cents wuuuut i know caramelized onions are cents and jalape√±os are another cents also if it matters to you the meat is halal cost sooooo nice to a poor grad student and the burger leaves you full atmosphere tiny as is everything in greenwich haha but cute i would avoid going at busy hours unless youre planning to pick up staff very nice and efficient theyre quick and manage the high volume very well will i be back for suuuuure got my eyes on the lamb burger and truffle fries next
lucky is a new bar in the east village owned by a bartender who has been at it for years and it shows i was part of an event that was being held here and definitely enjoyed the vibe that was going on abby the ownerbartender is engaging and friendly and knows how to pour a good drink cara too is just as awesomethe bar area and outdoor patio was clean as well as the bathroom which seems to be something people mention when reviewing this place the bar itself was decorated nicely and kept dimly lit one major plus here is their awesome jukebox the jukebox here has mixes from various famous nyc bars abby has tended and has a little bit of everything ranging from punk to alternative and everything in betweenone thing that will bring me back for sure is the non pretentious attitude here nothings worse than a bar that treats you as if you dont belong there not here you feel welcomed as if youve been a long time friend id recommend this place and suggest you stop by
my husband and i have been coming to this place at least twice a week now for about months why because they are really particular about the products they curate they research and tastetest all the ice cream and chocolates the items they carry all have a story history or a charming anecdote the owner has a diverse knowledge of chocolate dont believe me ask him i was blown away from his explanation of virgin chocolate and their ratings on the international market wowwe are always so happy to frequent this place it is a true new york gem a true neighborhood shop that carries verifiable best of the best make sure you step on the red carpet when the place gets busyas it does often we earned our badge of honor todaythe owner gave us a sample of his finest chocolate in a sealed and pressedstamped bag thank you for the beautiful customer service

tldr this is the real deal do yourself a favor and call in advance to get a numberitll shorten your wait time significantly order everything on the menu repeat the next dayif you havent noticed theres been a seismic shift in the chinese culinary scene in manhattan for years ive had to make a tough choice between pleasing my taste buds or my eyes when coworkers asked for recommendations i struggled to think of a single name that would score high on all three metricsauthenticity decor and service alas we cannot have it all or so i thought enter megawealthy chinese restaurateurs and investors loaded with cash money this wealth is not only flooding the investments market but also penetrating the culinary scene several new restaurants backed by big names are slated to open in and these are imports straight from the motherland so are guaranteed to be good finally new yorkers will discover what chinese food is actually like in china all rejoice lets take a moment to think about how fat were gonna get ok good now sichuan mountain house has already generated a significant following in flushing it made its debut in saint marks place last week and i just had to see it myself the chinese name which has much more character references a rather curious nocturnal animal with poor vision but a great sense of smell i can imagine all the dinners turning into pangolins as soon as they enter tuning into the deliciously spicy aroma of chili peppers the owners want to create an atmosphere that is just like a little house in the szechuan province boy did they do a good job the interior transports me into an episode of wu lin wai zhuan the service is impeccable as for the food i dont see a need to elaborate other than subtly suggesting that your entire outlook on life will be improved out of the or so dishes we tried these especially stood out sliced pork belly with chili garlic soy their signature dish literal translation white meat draped over a clothing line steamed crab with sticky rice the sticky rice was perfectly cooked and having soaked in all the flavors of the crab meat simply delicious i could eat three bowls of this fish fillet with pickled mustard green the broth was reduced to a white creamy consistency that is making me salivate as im thinking about it now the mushrooms were very fresh fried rice with pineapple i usually try to stay as far away from fried rice as possible but this dish cast fried rice in a whole new light the pineapples were slightly tart and sweet lighting up the rice and seafood a note on the tea the complimentary tea is seriously good its not that moldy threeday old stuff restaurants forget to refresh given the aroma i suspect it is tie guan yin its cleansing and a perfect foil for all the spicy dishes thumbs up on choice of teai expect sichuan mountain house to go far and it will be more than deserving of whatever status it achieves a shortlist of new restaurants slated for manhattan openings dadong the original beijing roast duck they announced a november opening and was immediately booked straight through december holy bananas dalongyi sichuanstyle hotpot dou lao fang the dolar shop cantonese style according to wikipedia pangolins have large protective keratin scales covering their skin and they are the only known mammals with this feature they live in hollow trees or burrows depending on the species pangolins are nocturnal and their diet consists of mainly ants and termites which they capture using their long tongues they tend to be solitary animals meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring which are raised for about two years pangolins are threatened by hunting for their meat and scales and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats and are the most trafficked mammals in the world so no eating pangolins you animals
bep ga is one of my top choices when it comes to chicken pho the shop is a hole in the wall place hidden in deep chinatown thanks to my vietnamese friend who is always looking for food pho i found this gemalthough the menu has limited items basically chicken over rice and chicken pho bep ga means chicken in vietnamese both of them are very healthy and flavorful yet light which is perfect for summer if you want additional kick ask for their special lemon based hot sauce per bowl is very fair price given quality and quantity will come back soon
we found this place accidentally while on a korean fried chicken crawl we googled and yelped but nothing showed up super psyched we decided to pull up to the bar as one of the first customers fyi this place is in the food court on the floorwe talked to the manager and found out the grand opening was recent and he gave us some excellent personalized servicewe ordered the wings in original flavor without the sauce some parm fries and a grapefruit hefeweizenwings came out piping hot and crunchy the meat was moist and juicy we loved the fries besides being crispy the parmesan made the fries more buttery than cheesy got to love that buttery tasting fries over peanut or veggie oiled fry the side of slaw was creamy but wasnt drippy went of dressing it had a nice crunch also the cabbage was not in shreds but instead diced to top off the meal we got a grapefruit hef its hef and grapefruit juice its both grapefruit refreshing while giving a slight buzz to people who hate beer you can also get the grapefruit beer as a frozen tropical drinkexcellent find imo we will definitely have to come back for the other stickier wings

i love this place its very quaint and their coffee packs a good punch lots of times in the morning the line is literally out the door and honestly its for good reason the coffee is always delicious and so are their baked goods my favorite order is to get is the draft latte and a zucchini brownie the staff here is pretty friendly and the coffee and goods are pretty consistent ive been to a few locations but i go to this one the most because its near where i work there arent a lot of tables but you usually are able to find a spot after a short wait

with gimmicky dessert shops popping up on every corner it is easy to roll your eyes as yet another ice cream shop with opens their doors in lower east side however i was blown away with the creativity presentation and quality of ice cream i met the young women who recently opened the shop behind the counter they told me that they were aiming to incorporate their asianamerican culture into the stax ice cream experience and they certainly succeeded fortunately the staff was patient enough to cater to my indecisiveness by providing samples of every flavor behind the counter all of the ice cream was thick and rich with flavor i was lured in with their range of tea flavored ice cream earl grey jasmine milk and of course a bright green matcha contrasting to the tea i loved their truly authentic american flavors such as orange dreamsicle fruity pebbles snickerdoodle smores and cornflake bourbonwhich was my favorite i expect to see a surge of young instagrammers boomeranging their signature pressed donut ice cream sandwich as impressive as the ice cream sandwich is i am sure this shop will last well beyond the novelty the very high quality and unique choice of ice cream flavors should bring a consistent crowd to this shop for time to come i wish stax best of luck in their opening months

remarkable service the small size of this place almost makes it look like a hole in the wall but the service is a the owner and the staff pay solid attention to details and are willing to go the extra mile for you they will also offer to serve you wine and make you a variety of yogi teas i came in at the last minute for a pedicure with less than minutes time limit i was seated right away at the massage chair and the lady did a perfect job right on time with drink offers mini feet massage and a mini shoulder massage i was also given a real flipflop at the end with multiple colors to choose from along with a plastic bag for my shoes those who know me knows that i am very particular with the pedicure which most salons cannot get it right but this one didoverall i would say this is the best salon in the neighborhood polish still looks fresh after a month will be back
the met goes out of its way to remain relevant in todays age of instance gratification via the web walking though its egyptian and persian exhibitions is an experience in time travel and a physical record of our collective human experience preserved intact for posterity artifacts are protected for the regressive fads du jour such as the taliban intentionally destroying ancient afghani temples and cultural icons the guards know the museum and become guides that can direct you out of the labyrinth i hadnt been at the met in a while but i am glad that i made it a point to godespite that ive been there dozens of times before
i try to make a pilgrimage to katzs at least once a year and since the last time id been here was february of it was high time to come againim always a little miffed when i hear people knock on katzs or a lot of good places more generally for being a tourist trap being overpriced etc etc the reality of all truly good places is that they will inevitably become popular so long as marginal costs dont exceed marginal revenues after having existed since katzs proves that it can still power on and even though it gets criticized for being too touristy it proves that it is indeed something special by virtue of having survived so longi came in on a tuesday this year at thinking it would be relatively empty instead i found it was actually quite crowded i splurged a little bit this time and finally tried the italian bread its extrayou know considering the prices here it might actually make sense to lose your ticket i by myself managed to consume dollars worth of food by myself just another more to break even losing your ticket poses a fine of the prices are high yes but perhaps not unjustified its what people are willing to pay in a town like new york too where i think we have relatively good hot pastrami the market should be quite competitive so they deserve creditpastrami and smoked meats dont have the same elegance or gravitas a lot of americans like to assign things like sushi probably due to all these jiro dreams of sushi type things floating around but to make a pastrami joint as successful as katzs you have to be equally dedicated to your craft especially so since there are so many haters momentum and history alone is not enough to keep a business running we all saw what happened to carnegies it was rightfully deserveda small note i think the sweet pickles here are much better than the sour oneswill be back
are you a foodie that appreciates amazing ingredients and crafted chefs meals are you in a rush then come to made nice as its been said the team behind eleven madison park and the nomad is behind made nice youll see some similarities such as a chicken for two except instead of its i havent had that yet but i have come twice in one week to try cod proven√ßal so so yummy perfect cooked flavorful cod with some kind of pesto chickpea puree and fennel its amazing to have such a meal with care for the crispy chickpeas are the best part of this dish great texture play very filling chicken rice again yummy pieces of crispy chicken skin olives tomato and juicy and tender dark chicken breast make for an a chicken type biriyani type thing great flavor this i had an hour after pick up and it was still tasty i brought the pork and carrots for my husband he had it an hour later and considering its braised pork shoulder i think this held just fine really good fris√©e and artisanal carrots also tried the delicious garlic rolls which are like parmesancrusted garlic knotsand only and finally had the milk and honey which was airy and unique a bit too sweet for me but recognize why so many would love it staff is polite and prompt theyre very attentive and you order quickly and wait time for food is no longer than minutes seating space is moderately big and you get to seethe open kitchen which makes for a good dine in experience the to go containers look good and i feel have a filling portion happy to come back try the khao salad and salmon rosti
now in my top of favorite nyc ice cream along with grom fresco east village great italian ice cream with all natural ingredients love the pistachio flavor first time i find it in nycdisclaimer im not into gimmicky ice cream that is corn flake soft serve birthday rainbow sprinkles potato chip ice cream waffle tacos etc packed with junk food artificial flavors colors so dont waste your time reading this if thats your thing true they do have ice cream sushi here but thats not what i like about this place i do eat lots of gimmicky ice cream but except for some of the asian stuff japanese taiyaki thai rolled etc i really dont go for the american junk food ideas disclaimer i love italian ice creamor basically any ice cream with real natural ingredients with flavor you like rainbow sprinkles that taste like a rainbow what the heck is that supposed to have as a flavor anyways yes presentation is great but taste comes firstall the ice cream here has simple natural ingredients that are often sourced directly from italy milk cream hazelnuts pistachios lemons etc the owner is from turin and most of the key ingredients also come from the same piemonte region in italy so how come farm to table hasnt reached ice cream yet seems stuck in a junk food trend rut why not compete with italian ice cream by creating our own fresh unique local ingredients like with trendy kale brussel sprouts lets do local ice cream flavors like lime grapefruit bourbon mezcal butternut squash avocado cranberry sweet corn etc anyways just my cents
i have walked passed the restaurant countless times and have noticed the cute outdoor seating area however it wasnt until yesterday that i had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant when i was invited to come in for a complimentary dinner and see the true charm of the restaurant disclaimer this review represents my own unbiased opinionto start off i had both the capri rinha and the goto cocktails and they were both strong and deliciousfor appetizers i tried both the fritto misto and the cozze in padella the fritto misto was comprised of fried calamari as well as two pieces of fried shrimp and two pieces of fried artichoke hearts they were lightly battered and perfectly fried with no greasy residual left over the cozze in padella steamed pei mussels was plentiful and thoroughly cleaned although im not a big fan of mussels i couldnt stop eating because the broth was irresistible the waitress was even kind enough to offer us more bread when she saw me sharing with my friendsince their pastas are all homemade i decided to order the linguine nere alla sarde for my entree the squid ink pasta had an abundance of seafood and potatoes i truly loved this dish even my dinner companion who didnt like the squid ink pasta at another restaurant ended up raving about this dish there were also hints of chili flakes which gave the dish a nice little kick my friend got the bistecca alla griglia which was a hefty portion of the ny strip steak i was very surprised at how good this dish was especially since we were at a italian restaurant it was cooked quite nicely and seasoned perfectly the steak went very well with the arugula salad on the side and fried potatoes to finish up our meal we ordered both the tiramisu as well as three scoops of gelato the gelato was already melting by the time it got to us and the tiramisu was beautifully presented but the taste was disappointing to say the leastoverall i would highly recommend this restaurant our waitress was attentive and very friendly and welcoming our drinks appetizers and entrees were all delicious but i would probably skip the desserts next time
one of the prettiest and cleanest stations in nyc definitely deserves stars its as if the dinosaur fossil impressions on the lower level have scared away the rats or perhaps they find better pickings at the nearby central park i suspect that being the main station leading to a top tourist attraction the museum of natural history has forced mta to put this station tops on its a list of stations to keep clean whatever the reason this station is a joy to stop in with the colorful animal mosaics on the top level such a delight for the eyes just be prepared for the stampede of tourists and school kids as they unload from the trains and get ready to visit the museum so only artwork and not your trodden remains decorate the floors
lena just moved in the neighborhood and it is a fantastic spot delicious coffee tasty pastries and freshly baked muffinshigh marks for the gluten free muffins that are perfectly browned sweetened and have a slight spongeycakelike texture while still being a muffin perfectionthe decor is modern open and inviting great natural lighting and very spacious with table and couch seating optionsthe service just couldnt be better either pierre the owner who also has a lena location on w near washington square park made us feel so welcome and served up great coffee and warm muffins which he baked himselfprotips they also serve wine and beer and the space is great for eventsi love to see local businesses pop up and do well and im happy to see lena bringing such a positive presence to the neighborhood see you again soon pierre
in a city full of great cafes and restaurants why is fiat cafe the first place i think of when i come back to nyc after being away it could be that anna the daytime server makes you feel like a returning friend not just another customer it might be that i like that the place evokes memories of simple cafes in a roman neighborhood or some small italian village but these things wouldnt matter if the food did not so consistently exceed expectations heres an example lunch yesterday i ordered avocado toast with scrambled egg whites extra on whole grain bread greens with a touch of vinaigrette came as a side i put some salt and bit of tabasco on the eggs werent rubbery like most scrambled they were light like a souffl√© in texture and like cumulous clouds in appearance the avocado was copious and warm the bread was crunchy something so simple done well that kind of sums up what i like about fiat cafei first came here to have breakfast on weekends while my wife slept late since she started coming with me for lunch its pretty much our weekend lunch spot i highly recommend any pasta the fish soup any omelette and any desert the chocolate ganache and panna cotta need to be tasted theyre beyond what words can describe my original review is below time and revisits have only reinforced my original impressionsi basically described it as a funky little cafe on mott street with minimal effort at trendy decor hardly any kitchen space and where they dont take credit cards it reminds me of what downtown was like before it got gentrified i love the place the most expensive design element here is their neon sign come here with no expectations of a culinary masterpieceso youll be surprised that some things so uncomplicated can be so good sit and enjoy your coffee wine beer or prosecco its always calm and off the tourist radarso far prices are reasonable service is good since its only five feet from the kitchen to the tables its where i go once a week for a breakfast omeletwhich they graciously cook to my specifications if you look at previous yelp reviews you can see that people either love it or hate it as i said im in the former group but i look at diningdrinking as an experience to be appreciated in context in this case the atmosphere enhances the experience i can almost imagine im sitting in a run down cafe on a small side hstreet in trastevere in romealmost
noodle cravingsrevisitedso after a year of missing this place i was sitting in my house and im like you know what im gonna get noodles tonight this place popped in my head so i hopped on the train and arrived here as i walked in i could already smell the flaring heat and the spicy smells of the noodle babymaking going on in the kitchen i realized why i needed to come back herespicy spicy i ordered the beef with layman noodles and i told them to make it the spiciest you can possibly make it eating into the noodles was a rush of the spicy goodness mixed with the juice bell peppers and chopped tomatoes it was filled with pure joy as i took each bite they also have water right next to the kitchenits just right for the meal they also have dumplings you can not forget about dumplings what are your thoughtsi truly love this place i will come back here with friends my family cause this place is a hidden gem in harlem so if you happen to be strolling along and in need of a early afternoon or late night noodle pull then this place will be for you
cant believe i got the last cruffin of the morning on opening day feeling very lucky i had just missed the lychee croissant i arrived at after a friend texted me about it at the line wasnt too crazy but definitely should get there earlier to get the flavors you want it sells out really quickly i think it was sold out by in all of the flavors i bought out of flavors i enjoyed the peachy mess twice baked croissant the best i also really love the boxes the service was super friendly and fast ill definitely come back here again to eat more
ive been to this place twice the first time i came here i came for sunday brunch after going to morgan library and museum this place is absolutely beautiful the decor is amazing it makes you feel relax and fun i loved sitting in one of the booths with their lovely decor i ordered the eggs benedict and they were great my friend ordered sliders and fries i tried those and they were goodthe second time i came here i came on at about on a saturday just like the first time the staff was very friendly the food was great this time i tried the appetizer sampler it was two of us and we could not finish it things i lovefriendly staffdrink good and strongfood is great
review may be biased because i was served by literally the most good looking waiter id ever seen i dont think my friend and i were able to form coherent sentences for a few minutesmade a reservation for breakfast on a holiday weekend and this place was still packed to the gills so id say a reservation is a must id never come here for a nondinner meal before so insisted on getting the famous bread basket to share in addition to main courses even has a carboholic this may have been a mistake a delicious mistake but a mistake nonetheless the bread basket while pricey on first glance was huge way more than two people could ever possibly eat if they wanted to get out of the restaurant alive it included a full sized sticky bun croissant chocolate croissant brioche various breads and im sure im forgetting at least one all from their own bakery absolutely worth itmy main was the eggs benedict which come with a side of home fries im not normally a breakfast person but this was probably the best rendition of the dish ive ever had eggs were perfectly poached hollandaise sauce was as rich as warren buffett and the home fries were on a level i didnt know nonfried potatoes could reach balthazar is an nyc institution for a reason years and counting and is well worth the advanced planning required to dine here
i dont have much to add to the many reviews already praising the ube and black sesame in fact those reviews lead me into choosing those two flavorsi went at a good time since there was no line and there was no pressure to hurry my order even though i wanted ube and black sesame i was offered a tasting of those two flavors before i pulled the trigger i stuck with my original choice stupid me i should have tried other flavors too like coconut and matcha loli think my ubeblack sesame looked awesome and i was able to get a good shot of it in the stand i would normally give this place stars but i dont know what it is whether it was the perfect weather my empty belly having no line to wait on andor the pretty smiling cashier i felt this place called for starsthe only thing i could complain about and im starting to feel i like to bitch a lot lately is that the ice cream melted pretty quick and i felt i had to eat it fast to prevent a puddle from forming under me when i finished i felt a great satisfaction of having a stomach full of very tasty ice cream good day
pieces minutes plain and simple whats there not to love true this place is almost identical to sushi on jones but hey you dont get chef david bouhadana if you go to sushi on jones according to eater he is no longer involved with that project hes super animated behind the sushi counter and often interacts with his guests posing for photos and dancing for boomerangs haha the flavorsgarnishes are also a bit counter seats in total only for sushi by bou and more to the side of it for sushi by bae which is now served up by oona tempest formerly of tanoshi and ginza onodera for a higher price of per head text for reservations josh is super nice dont be late as they give away your seat to walkins if youre more than minutes latesince its omakase no need to order which makes things super simple he does ask you for allergies or dietary restrictions before your meal starts everything was made super well and tasted super fresh at first glance i thought the rice looked a bit too loose but when i picked it up with my hands it held together quite well my favorite pieces were the botan shrimp toro uni and scallop all of these literally melt in your mouth and are bursting with flavor though the main show is pretty much always the torching of the wagyu beef and the layering of uni over it i kinda felt like i preferred them separate wagyu beef was a little stringy though it had awesome flavorif you have more time in your minute slot you can always order more a la carte or add a wagyuni handroll for as always is still water is fiji but here you get complimentary sake they come and refill your cup throughout the meal as well not sure if jones does this now since i went a while agobut this was a pleasant surprisewould definitely come here again for some quick and relatively cheap but high quality sushi great place to bring a friend to if theyre visiting from out of town tooone worthy thing to note is that he no longer serves his famous tres amigos uni quail egg ikura here was looking forward to it but it wasnt on the menu anymore
i had been eyeing pizzaniste since before they opened while one may think this is yet another pizzeria being added to the tremont ave strip the floortoceiling windows which made up the exterior led me to think this was something different today i had the opportunity to grab lunch here with my brother and found that my suspicions were accurate unlike most pizzerias at pizzaniste you can choose from a number of individual sized pie creations or you can create your own pizza with custom toppings i was a fan of the aesthetics the front walls of the restaurant are able to fully extend out and as such pizzaniste has a very open feel to it its larger than most pizzerias and has a modern decor with lots of clean lines and a full view of the workstation where you can see your pie being assembledwhile you can create your own pie they have a number of them on the menu that you can choose from as well i decided to take the latter option and went with the spinach artichoke pizza this was a white pizza topped with guess what artichokes spinach and ricotta i was a fan the pies are made to order so it was super fresh the flavors worked really well together service was amazing everyone was super friendly and eager to help from the time we walked in we were greeted warmly and it continued up until we left aside from the food its things like this that set a business apart from others and i need to commend them for a job well doneoverall pizzaniste is a great place its not your typical pizzeria but its a welcome and arguably needed change in this area of the bronx which is oversaturated with pizza places the fresh ingredients they use and killer service they provide definitely make them a for me great job guys
this was one of the best things i could have done for myself i called her based on a feeling that i needed some additional clarity in my life and i was right from the moment i met angel she made me feel confident that i was in the right place and in good hands she knows what she is talking about and explains things in a way that kept me constantly laughing and really enjoy our time together she spent a lot of time with me covering everything and allowed me to record the entire conversation she also followedup with an indepth time line and information about myself thank you angel i look forward to seeing you again
my friends and i celebrated our good friends bachelorette party here at first i felt a bit hesitant and nervous as this is not really my kind of thing but we really enjoyed ourselves the guys were very respectful and no physical contact unless you gave consent we had vip for our group of which i totally recommend since youll be more relaxed and comfortable due to expedited entry guaranteed seating and champagne bottles also staff was very nice and attentive
we went for brunch sunday about noon no reservations but they were able to seat us at a good table in the main part of the dining room this place is gorgeous see my pictures there is a small swanky bar area to your right and dining room to your left i would say there is an even mix of locals and tourists due to the fact that the restaurant is in the ultra cool howard hotel we had one drink each both very well made with plenty of alcohol i had the avocado toast not bad maybe needed a little pepper and a touch more lemon juice and julie went for the whole poached lobster tail julie made the best choice she gave me a bite scrumptious we ordered french press coffee for two our bill came to just under not bad for the james beard award for best new restaurant in the country announced last night we will for sure go back for dinner
the whiskey ward is one of my all time favorite establishments in the les i try not to go to the same place multiple times but how can you turn this place down especially on the weekends when just about every hot spot in the les turns into a full fledged disaster zone the whiskey ward manages to remain pretty chill most of the time and retain its charm no lines no nonsensethe whiskey selection is pretty strong as you enter and make your way to the bar youre treated to their menu of whiskeys written in delightfully small chalk make sure you have your glasses or contacts on fun to experiment grab your poison of choice and dont forget to indulge in a bowl of peanuts bartenders are cool and do a great job mixing the drinks try out their les sweet tea sometime its delightfully dangerous they have cocktails that are available in addition to the straight liquor selection zero complaints about service price here these guys definitely do it rightmusic in the bar is right up my alley classic rock and its always at the right volume level no screaming or shouting when trying to communicate to your friendsif youre in the neighborhood i fully support any decision that involves coming to this place
what a great addition to fidi i never thought that david cheng will open up one of his restaurants around downtown area with number of lunch options here but people still complains downtown have limited options i am so glad they open up fuku with milk bar next to it their fried chicken is definitely one of the best i have ever had my favorite is their regular fried chicken with radish and fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce a little twist to regular fried chicken sandwich their chicken bites are amazing with saam sauceif you decided to go for something healthyrice bowl this is one of my favorite chicken rice bowl huge and filling brown rice with chicken breast kimchi veges and some pine nuts are so flavorful that i dont even need to add any dressing their salad is also amazing with fried chickpeas its so unique that i never see it in other salad storesdinner optionschimek you cant get it in other location so grab your friends and order this you gotta eat it by wrapping it with the bread and the sauce its absolutely one of my favoritei will be back
its worth it i was a bit skeptical at first really minutes for but yes really the quality of sushi is great and we had a blast reservation is definitely recommended as there are only seats best for parties of outside seating only high top chairs with hooks for pieces of nigiri including king salmon torched chutoro wagyu with really interesting addons for extra price summer special includes uni with truffle double happinessthey dont skimp out on the fish pieces each piece is delicious and the accompanied sushi rice is not too big my favs were the torched chutoro and the king salmon surprisingly we were both moderately full after our meal they do charge you for hot tea and bottled water overall i am very pleased with our experience the price tag may seem high for a short meal but i didnt feel rushed at all food was phenomenal and the chefs are interactive they asked us how we enjoyed each piece and made sure we were happy

street taco sounds like something youd buy on an arbitrary corner of manhattan on a day you forgot to pack your lunch are slammed with meetings and need something sloppy and delicious from a food cart to forget anyall workplace woesin reality street taco is a cool restaurant with a wellcurated palette of decor ranging from patterned tables reminiscent of the shinings infamous carpet to walls paneled with oversized rustic tiles √† la the remnants of mexican masonry from the someone who will order everything else on the menu of a mexican restaurant before i order tacos for example i would onehundredpercent order enchiladas before ordering tacos id order a chimichanga or a burrito tamales quesadillas fajitas et al over tacos i have absolutely nothing against tacos and my lack of desire for tacos is probably one of the most bizarre things about methat being said the street tacos tacos i sampled completely satiated my rare desire for tacos the gringo ground beef pico crema and monterey jack in a hard shell had a crunch as satisfying as the crunch of a dorito after youve not had doritos in years another random food item that is delicious butfor not even one reasoni never eat the flavors and juiciness going on in the gringo taco are impossible to put into words the pollo asado pico chipotle salsa crema radish and queso fresco was super fresh and as savory as the gringo street taco forced me to face my indifference to tacos and realize i need to make taco experiences more frequent

pinch is one of those places that is special not only because of their outstanding food but also because of the thoughtfulness with which they approach it the ambiance of the space is pulled together sophisticated and artful without being at all stuffy or pretentious i especially love the viewing window where you can watch their artisan chefs fold all of their dumplings into beautiful shapes just a quick glance at their menu shows that they really know and understand their target and are hitting it perfectly this is elevated modern chinese cuisine with enough confidence to call itself that while im not an expert on chinese food the mix of familiar dishes with ones that are harder to find is just enough to keep you from feeling neither under nor overwhelmed there are both refined flavors and ones that pack a punch and i wasnt the least bit disappointed with any dish that we tried in fact their consistency each time weve gone is one of the most impressive things about the experience they also throw in some charming quirks like cocktails named after the lyrics of call me maybe if you like something smoky i especially recommend the this is crazy everything was also very clean down to their bathrooms and their staff were all very welcoming and attentiveseafood pork soup dumplings their dumplings are the star of the show no way around it of course with their dtftrained chefs expectations are high and they nailed it perfectly the wrapper on the outside was sturdy with that slight chewiness that i love and the porkseafood broth inside is heavenlymushroom dumplings if you love the earthy flavor of mushrooms and truffles you absolutely have to order this one i could eat of these and be perfectly happy with my life choicesspicy wontons again the quality of the wrapper is absolutely key and the flavor of the oils and spices in the sauce just makes you want to discreetly drink it under the tablemarinated cucumber totally the unsung hero of the meal i am addicted to the cool crunch of the cucumber and the delicately balanced flavors it seems so simple but when you taste it youll know that a lot of finesse went into this dishniman ranch cumin ribs the flavor on these ribs seriously blew my mind the meat is tender and comes right off the bone and the spices on top are phenomenal i have never had anything like it anywhere else even if they didnt have dumplings i would still come for these ribsthree cup chicken the chicken itself is properly cooked to just the right doneness and the sauce is flavorful without making you feel like youre going past your sodium intake limit for the day i also love the fresh herbs they throw inseafood fried rice the rice is amazingly fluffy and punctuated by nice big pieces of shrimp scallop and crab the flavor is subtle really relying on the naturally rich flavor of the seafood i sound like a broken record but this one is also a mustoverall you can find cheap chinese food anywhere but from what ive seen you can only find this level of thoughtfully curated aesthetic and experience here at pinch
so happy this place opened while there are a few coffee shops in the area most dont serve matcha i was walking by sunday and decided to check it out the next day i came around and was told they usually close at but i was still able to get a matcha latte the owner i thought he was at least was super nice and made a delicious matcha latter with almond milk it came out to which is really good because theres a place down the street that charges which is crazy they also use my favorite almond milk brand the barista blend califa one i saw they have a baked goods shelfstand but since i was here late i didnt get to try one guess i will have to come backthe place has a very cozy environment and i will definitely be hanging out here more
in loooove i was looking for a subtle but new cut and after avoiding it for weeks decided to give it a shot here i worked with tara and let me tell ya this girl made my hair go from drab to fab most stylists are overwhelmed with my hair but she handled it so beautifully and always kept what i wanted in mind she always made sure we had the same vision and worked with me to make sure we were headed in the right direction she also made sure i was comfortable the entire time very sweet and professional she also spent the time to style it afterwards and always answered any hair questions i had in general loved my cut so much from tara will be returning for my balayage with her later this week and will keep you posted the location is also cute its entrance can be a bit tricky but look for the door that reads jane fox next to the gnc store
is it just me or did the egg tarts used to be a lot cheaper than the current a pop its somehow stamped in my memory that in a bygone era they were only a quarter each and i would get four in a bag to myself cradling the waxen paper each tart still hot from the ovensometimes they have the fluorescent green egg tarts but those sell out in a jiffy the regular egg custards are best when slightly toasted and warm my favorite part that always ends too soon is the soft eggy middle heres what else ive tried and heartily recommend moon cake with the lotus seed paste and green tea mooncake pineapple bun these are so good my hk friends taught me the traditional way to eat these slice it in half toast it and then stick a thick slab of butter inside i cant really concentrate after eating one but its well worth the sacrifice sachima if youre chinese youll know exactly what this is because chances are that your parentsgrandparentsaunties have a few of these individually wrapped cellophane blocks stuck inside an empty blue royal dansk butter cookie bin i basically just summed up your entire childhood lung moons iteration isnt overly sweet and has just enough honey syrup triangle sponge cake like angel cake only fluffier sweet black bean bun and pork bun youll want to take a nap after eating this the only miss was with the cream puffs i dont know what happened but i got an extremely stale batch
including tip for piece omakase i would still tip your sushi chef a little bit at the end what a dealthey are very strict with their time and do not seat late parties i appreciated this as we were not disturbed at all during our meal i also thought the little cards with our names were a nice touch they just opened weeks ago so they are still relatively new but the sushi is fresh and reminds me of japan my rice was falling apart a little for some of the pieces at the end we asked the chef to recommend some additional pieces and he was more than happy to show us the ala carte pieces were also decently pricedyou can now make your reservation easily on opentable i will definitely be back
a great addition to the neighborhood i no longer have to trek to the village for my favorite indian food they have the traditional dishes here like the channa masala or veg biryani wirh yogurt but can be made vegan and some dishes ive never had before i was ecstatic to see that they have a separate section between veg and vegan items we had the chilli gobi to start which is a spicy breaded cauliflower in a sweet and tangy sauce very spicy the red pumpkin thoran curry is simply divine savoury with a nice coconut flavor it is perfect with the kadhai bindi an okra dish which was crispy and all sorts of yummy the onion fritters pakora are nicely done i especially enjoyed the combination of the cabbage fry with the dal yellow lentils attentive service and friendly staff plenty of seating good for groups or a date comfy seats and delicious food i cant ask for moreoverall were very pleased with the food and cant wait till our next visit

delicious we swung by after viewing photos on yelp and were really happy that the food was better than what we expected we didnt have reservations but there were plenty of spaces as the restaurant is quite spacious the restaurant was surprisingly not loud although it was crowded the decor resembles a western saloon there is something for everyone here a romantic indoor patio in the back reservations highly recommended a happening bar near the front and a relaxing and open dining area for people like me who just like diningthe food was incredibly good we had the veal and eggplant grilled shrimp and allwhite salad i appreciate that they use the best and freshest ingredients for each dish the sauces and dressing was just sufficient as to not overhelm the dish i love the huge shrimp they used as they were more than plenty plump and juicy it was a wonderful dining experience overall
i work on the same block as zio and just started visiting this establishment but i will tell you they won me over i almost want to call it love at first sight just dont tell my husband one day after work my coworkers and i wanted to grab drinks and decided since our favorite place was rather packed it is a good idea to try something else immediately upon walking into zio the ambiance had me hooked it is truly a beautiful space with perfectly dimmed lights beautiful decor and an open kitchen as well there was four of us and the bar was packed but they offered us a table which was perfectget this this have happy hour every single day from draft beers wine specialty cocktailswhile there i ordered the fried zucchine with calamari and it was the best decision i made all day the customer service is out of this world as well i enjoyed myself so much last week i decided to drop in this week to grab a quick drink and dinner at the bar once again they knocked it out the park i had the ravioli and i am still currently dreaming about it also our group had the prosciutto cheese and arugula thin crust pizza life changing thank you for becoming my new fav
returning for the sushi omakase since i really enjoyed the nigiri set my last visit the meal was very very pleasant overall fish quality is above par in the city very fresh fish and nice variety at seasonable pricesscallop squid eel totoro snapper and hokoiddo uni were my favorites every piece is fresh sweet and flavorful with prefect amount of soy saucevinegar scallop is sweet fatty and juicy the squid is sweet with the soft texture like scallop smart move to add yuzu peels to the sweet eel which balances the flavor really well totoro is heaven fatty melting and aromatic totoro would simply satisfy all my sushi cravings red snapper tastes amzing too fatty soft sweet and flavorful literally melts in your mouth best i have had of this kind hokoiddo uni is surprising juicy usually drier in texture at most places its so juicy and sweet that i can just drink it like a shotoverall very good nigiri nice pace and good service will come back more often
in the world of doughnuts theres either amazing doughnuts or crappy doughnuts and dunwell is amazing i had the blueberry peanut yeast doughnut and was curious at first about the flavor combo but was surprised at how well they worked together the doughnut itself wasnt too doughy or heavy and not greasy the flavor was definitely there with the icing not being overly sweet freshness is definitely something these guys pay attention to it seems with about to different flavors theres not hundred donuts laying around all day small batches guarantee freshness with any place friendly staff decent prices clean shopid definitely go backbonus theyre vegan
one of the best museums in the city that never sleeps perfect for the whole family but be aware that kids can ask you funny questions about some of the prehistoric exhibitsin general it is important to know that the entrance is based on a suggested donation you dont really have to pay for a whole price ticket tourists always get this wrong its good that you support the institution though as long as you give some money theyll be good and you will get your entrance approvedthey also have at least two areas for food if im not mistaking the prices are super high though a bottle of water is about bucks bring your food or pay their price
this is my favorite thai place in nyc thus far not only is everything from the decor to the food visually beautiful but it is also delicious thai villa includeshere is what you need to reservations get everything from the special menu i havent tried anything that wasnt standard americanized thai dishes are also available cocktails are delicious and service ranges but errs on the side of solidthis is now my goto thai place for locals and tourists i highly recommend coming in here it easily outranks all other thai places in manhattan
i enjoyed myself immensely here they offer sake both sparkling and flat strong as well as green tea varieties i had a wonderful night of sake and japanese comfort food i ordered their shrimp tempura curry and got hubbs some takeout of chicken tonkotsu curry the small portions were big enough to have two servings each their fried gyoza are so banging and i could not stop eating them so good the food is great the service equally so and the staff is just so friendly its a blessing theyre locates only twenty minutes from my home and less than ten from my job i can definitely see myself making a few lunch trips here during the week
of all the japanese chains opening in nyc lately i was most excited to hear about ikinari steaks first us location i expected a line to be out the door on opening day but was very surprised there wasnt one when i arrived around am they opened at it was mostly press standing around blocking waitresses that were trying to bring food to customers or pressing against diners trying to eat there were only few actual diners but more customers started to stroll in by the time i left i was shown to a standing station right away and was done in min without scarfing down my food the menu is small with cuts of wetaged steak by weight and lunch special a few sides and a few drinks including beer and wine current prices are centsgram for ribeye centsgram for sirloin centsgram for filet there are minimum weight orders for the steaks so ribeye starts at sirloin at and filet at it works instead of going to a counter to order first an employee will showdirect you to a numbered standing station their model is based on standing dining stations but this location has a small number of seats ask about seats if you prefer one menus are already at the standing station a waiter will come over to bring water a paper apron take your order for drinks and sides only then the waiter will walk you or direct you to the back kitchen counter to order your meat cut of meat and weight you showtell the kitchen chef your table numbereven if you order the chuckeye steak lunch special which is not available by weight you still have to go tell the kitchen counter your order a little odd but i guess this is to make the process consistent for the staff after you order your steak you go back to your station and your food is brought out to you forks knives napkins condiments are already at your station there were no spoons a bill is brought to you when your steak is delivered keep it so you can pay at the front desk when you leavei had the chuckeye steak lunch special because its a good deal it comes with soup salad white rice media reports say the chuckeye is oz the lunch menu lists or oz the soup and salad are very small and basic but youre really paying for the steak my steak came out sliced on a sizzling platter with a side of corn the chuckeye already had nice color on the outside but was blue rare on the inside theres even a printed guide on how to enjoy your steak and they suggest rarei usually prefer my steak medium or medium rare but i went rare this time my chuckeye was very tender and flavorful from the fat and seasoning the house hot steak sauce was delicious but didnt cover up the steak not sure if the house steak sauce is hot because its warm and kept in a thermos or also spicy if there is spice i didnt really taste it but having warm sauce is perfect to help keep the steak warm theres also ikinari sauce that is a sweet sauce its also tasty but i preferred the house steak sauce they also sell bottles of the ikinari saucethey are a nontipping restaurant i walked out full and happy from chuckeye steak lunch for after taxabout that paper apronits a good idea to help keep any grease splatter from the sizzling hot plate from getting on your clothes the standing stations have lots of storage a shelf where you can place menus after ordering or to store items a hook to hang a coat or bags and even foldable stands on the floor that can hold briefcases or bags the kitchen is open so you do walk out smelling smokey like hibachi or kbbq places the restroom has a fancy japanese toilet with a dryer option theres also listerine if you want to be minty fresh and if youre so inclined they have a niku mileage membership card that you can sign up for to track the weight of meat you eat the card comes complete with lady liberty and has rewards after consuming a certain amount of beef ill be back to try other cuts definitely recommend trying this place for quality steak at reasonable prices
a little gem on macdougal for surewe all know there is lots to eat on macdougal but this joint is always on the top of my list besides the fact that they make the most delicious golden brown fries they are also what i like to call sauce heaven typically when you first walk in you will see a crowd of people standing by the register giving you the impression that the line is long but usually those people are just debating on what sauces to choose i love condiments and sauces probably because im so extra and the sauces here are unique eclectic and seriously delicious my favorite sauces are parmesan peppercorn curry ketchup and the sweet mango chutney mayo the staff is always very kind and you can tell they work great together as a team upon ordering the staff offers customers the option of sauce on the fries or the side ive experienced both options and i prefer to have it on the side because im a dip kind of girl
nice little cozy thai restaurant located at street and avenue the ambience is causal and dim with cute wall displays of bowls and plates representing their yummy dishes the service is quick and efficient i really like their pineapple fried rice and sangria their pineapple fried rice is sweet and savoryits like a party in your mouth their sangria is pretty unique compared to the other sangrias i had triedit is just right with a hint of lychee minimum for credit card
very friendly staff all aroundmeticulous job on the pedicure which kudos the lady used a non sharp toothpick to clean up any kind of polish that ended up on my skin and not on my nailthe shop is cozy and nicely decorated when you approach the counter you chat about what you want pick your polish color then are offered a tea black green mint and more there is a nice happy hour special for a manipedi before if you pay with cash
loved everything about taco mahalfrom the super sweet and bubbly girl at the front who handles the orders payments other reviewers mention her being the owners daughter to the bombbbb chicken tikka masala taco in a roti shell it was just filling enough for me to hold me over until dinner and the flavors were all on point ill definitely come back to try the other proteins or at least try my steady chicken tikka masala in a naan apparently the size of a normal taco
my favorite cookie place of all time so glad they opened this new location which is literally blocks away from the original location and the original place is still open the new location is a lot bigger brighter and based on my last visit has significantly shorter line back to the cookie they maybe the biggest and heaviest cookies you will ever have gooey on the inside a bit crunch on the outside my favorite is the oatmeal and raisin although the peanut butter chip one is amazing and so is the chocolate chip walnut one the double chocolate chip one is the sweetest and i get it the least often with that said if you put it in front me right now i will eat it
i love it here it is such a different experience then your typical nyc bar or rooftopi came on saturday with my boyfriend and two friends and had drinks and also ordered food we were lucky enough to not have to wait on a very long line it moves quickly though and once we got in we were lucky enough to find a table we started with a pitcher of white sangria which was tasty i have had it before from this venue so i knew what we were ordering once we finished that we order a bucket of coronas the bucket is a better deal than a pitcher because you get a beer free and theyre in bottles by the time we ordered the bucket of beer we were starting to get hungry so we order french fries and a burger they give you a buzzer so you know when your food is ready nice and organized our food came out relatively quickly and it was delicious overall this is a great place to go on a warm day because get to experience the feeling of being on a boat with beautiful views of the city and nj
this is the spot for dessert my absolute favorite dessert is lava cake and it is usually what i dedicate my cheat days to and the reason why i run so much the matcha lava cake here is pretty much perfection the warmth and the bittersweetness of the matcha lends itself to pair beautifully with the dark chocolate and that beautiful ooze when you poke at it with your spoon ah nothing is quite so satisfying the accompanying matcha ice cream provided that coldtowarm contrast and the cookie crumble offered a satisfying textural contrast in each bite pair it with a good cup of black tea and you have yourself a perfect sunday afternoonalso the service here is fantastic our waiter even advised us where to sit midsection by the windows if we want good instagrammable light haha and offered to refill our teas twice
dcbased pizza finally made it to nyc and they came in strong with free pizza for the first customers in line at their flatiron location on west street i was number and was thrilled to make the cut but for only and unlimited toppings i would have gladly waited in line even had my pizza not been freei have yet to see another restaurant opening pulled off as flawlessly as this one they had plenty of pizza representatives walking around the line with both pizza samples and drinks as well as menus they were quick to offer their own pizza preferences and answer any questions once inside a dj was spinning tunes and the servers behind the counter were working quickly to make sure the line moved at a fast pace everyone employee i came in contact with was friendly professional and had a smile on their face on a day as hectic as this one probably was for them they were amazing the pizza wow i really thought id eat just half and save the rest for lunch the following day but i ate it all so delicious for unlimited toppings meats cheese vegetables sauces etc is ridiculous but ill happily take advantage of it again
its more of a for the strange hiccups in restaurant management but the food is here is very solid especially with so much ramen competition in the city i accidentally stumbled upon eak ramen after a massage two blocks away and found this place on yelp little did i know it had opened days ago a chain from japan specializing in iekei eak ramen pork and shoyu broth combo with very thick noodles by of course sun noodleswe showed up and there seemed to be a lot of people waiting in line so we put our name down on the clipboard totto ramen style about min later we were seated which was pretty quick in my opinion given this place is brand new hyped and it was sunday dinner rush hour we did see a few empty seats at the bar for some reason that they werent filling for one reason or another we sat at the bar right in front of where a lady was washing cups and filling waters the entire time not really that appetizing to watch service was decent we were kind of served by the cup washer lady and our food was brought to us by other people it seemed a little disorganized to say the least and i heard another waitress expressing her frustration several times i also noticed that the bartender doesnt seem to know how to pour beer the beers she poured were like at least half foam our ramen also came out literally seconds after they gave us our appetizer yikes i hate when that happens because something always ends up getting cold ill give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that these new restaurant hiccups will likely get fixed as time passeshowever i came for the food and not really expecting much of service the karaage was hot freshly fried and very flavorful unlike some places they give you the option of choosing not one but two sauces off their list we got the garlic chili and sweet chili i liked the sweet chili the bestthe eak ramen original porkshoyu broth with thick noodles and the garlic puree and onion really did it for me it wasnt too salty and not too thick and the noodles were just the right consistency the egg was absolutely the best egg ive had in the city yum perfectly cooked and seasoned the pork left a bit to be desired as it wasnt really charred like tottos is but still melts in your mouth an extra side is and they give you a ton all in all this dish was quite satisfying and is one of the top ramens ive had in the city for suredefinitely worth a shot if youre a ramen snob like me hopefully they fix the service issues after theyve been open longer the porkshoyu broth and thicker noodles hit the spot for us

if i could give this i would my favorite indian place in hells kitchen super friendly owner great lunch specials and delicious food recently under new management it seems much better than a lot of the other indian places nearby that ive tried we had the cardamom rice pudding free with first yelp checkin and he was very insistent that next time he let us taste his homemade ice cream dinein veg curry lunch specials are but rice or naan is extra at takeout veg lunch special is and you get a free side plus rice or bread portions are huuge and delicious we had the okra and eggplant okra was slightly better spiced but if you prefer creamy do the eggplant plus they give you whole roasted mini eggplantsthe staff and especially the owner are extremely friendly and polite cant wait to come back
for those looking for the quintessential parisian bistro experience look no further than one of the latest newcomers to manhattans west village boucherie the restaurant opened at the end of to no small amount of acclaim thanks to the fact that chef jerom dihui former chef of mcnallys now shuttered pastis is behind the kitchens the venue has a sprawling dining room and bar area that gets plenty of sunlight during the earlier hours as well as a balcony on the second floor for those looking to impress everything about the decor from the sizeable mirror hung behind the bar to the marblepatterned tables and tiled floors is true to formon a breezy saturday evening the restaurant was happily buzzing and unsurprisingly occupied reservations in advance especially on busy days are recommended we had our pick of seats i recommend taking a table near the windowed doors or on the patio and were soon greeted by our server and paul the sommelier when i asked him for a wine recommendation a white or sparkling not too dry he pointed out an effervescent and slightly sweet brut rose which he asked me to taste first to make sure it was to my liking pinning down choices from the food menu however wasnt quite as easy so we ending up ordering almost all the dishes that had caught our eyesfor our starters we had gone with the escargot and the foie gras mousse the former were served piping hot and generously drenched in an addictive garlic butter and parsley sauce they were pleasantly toothsome and had none of the aftertaste ive sometimes encountered in dishes that werent executed to par ask for an extra side of bread to soak up the remaining sauce its that good my personal favorite however had to be the foie gras mousse its beautifully presented with a side of red wine onion compote frisee and toasted bread there are few things more perfectly balanced than a spread of the rich foie gras against the sweettartness of the onion compote supported by the firm slightly crunchy bread it may appear to be simple but theres a reason why this dish has stood the test of timewhen it came to the entrees i immediately gravitated to towards the duck confit which is served with a portion of confited duck leg frisee salad and a generous serving of black truffle chips the duck had a delightful crisp skin that yielded to a flavorful dark meat which paired well with the lighter salad that had the protein interspersed throughout it i was able to try the veal porterhouse as well which came impressively presented with the bone still in it was cooked to the requested medium rare and each portion of meat was juicy and tender pairing well with the red wineinfused veal jus that it was served with we rounded out our meal with a side of fries crispy hot and perfectly seasoned as well as a rustic ratatouille made with roasted tomatoes zucchini onions and mushroomswhat makes boucherie excel however is the caliber of service our plates were always promptly cleared and our server was always nearby to check on us when i dropped my knife off the table she was immediately at my side with a new one and while i may not be a wine expert those who do appreciate it will easily get lost in conversation with their sommelier paul he took a great deal of time to speak with us about his previous experiences including le bernardin and answered every question we had from the wines available at boucherie to the levels of certification as indicated by his sommerlier pini very much look forward to returning now that the weather will allow for dining al fresco and for those looking for a leisurely and welcoming meal in the city boucherie will certainly exceed your expectations

incredible experience for sushi lovers a lot of good sushi has to do with equal parts craft and equal parts sourcing and you get it all here at nakazawa my husband made a reservation for us to eat the omakase at the sushi bar for my birthday reservations open up days in advance online you need to reserve right at midnight because it fills up in minutes there are seating a night we went to the think the others are and you also better show up why wouldnt you or not be late as they will charge you if you dont service is really as youd expect serene and calm it was fun watching the chefs work at the bar but it was probably the calmest sushi bar id ever seen wasnt too much of a show per se you can i think more easily eat in their lounge but all sushi comes from the bar decor is zen and monochrome simple and clean as the japanese would have it drinks they have an extensive list of sake wine more by the bottle versus glass beers my husband ordered a japanese red rice ale which was malty and flavorful very interesting and i glasses of sauv blanc and gruner as for dings on service sometimes it was hard to hear or understand the chefs so i wish that our server did a better job of explaining each course i guess she was more conversational when it was required explaining different cuts of fish and demonstrating what was unique about each piece for instance call me stupid but ginger was given to us on the side and i had to ask what to do with it it was a palate cleanser in between each meal which honestly should be explained upfront since some people might think it goes with the fish dont do that you also shouldnt expect wasabi that will accompany the piece if the chef feels it goes they did explain though that you can eat either with your hands or chopsticks if hands they give you a little wet napkin to wipe in betweenthe omakase is pieces and im not going to dive into each one because my guess is things change based on what can be flown in they also ask you what you like and dont like ie my husband doesnt like roe of course customer service reigns supreme here as we noticed the couple next to us didnt like several of things sadly and were quickly given replacements but overall the real esoteric japanese fish were white in nature and ranged from things like spanish mackerel can be oily and fishy to other types of fish which i cant recall since all of the names are in japanese of course there were crowd pleasers like delicious salmon types one my favorites was one smoked with hay which has an earthy flavor others were more subtle others were salty based on the type of salmon like an alaskan sockeye you get to try all kinds of fish they create sushi from its not just from japan we also got to try very interesting shellfish sushi like a citrus squid with yuzu and sea scallop never really had these raw before i also enjoyed the square type sushi which we had with crab mostly all other types were nigiri no raw one of my favorites was the piece tuna trio from most lean to less lean to fatty tuna everyones favorite you get actually pretty educated about different cuts of fish with this meal for an upsell you can pay for pieces more which i recommend two types of uni one from california and one from japan not sure if i actually like uni unless mixed in a pasta but it was incrediblyfresh perhaps the real killer piece of this upsell is the waygu beef it was grade a something but trust me its worth the upsell for this barely cooked and rare done i dont usually eat beef this raw but it was so clean and fresh and flavorful and perfect pairing with the rice which mind you was incredible vinegary and flavorful absolutely yum with a hint of soy they also had a tasty hand roll with tuna towards the end of the meal which was salty and had good crunch from the nori for dessert you end the meal with a delicious house made tea which was so warming i forget the flavor but it was very good and then an egg sushi forget the name but the steamed egg is also pretty to look at and sweet and light in taste and best yet a scoop of lychee sorbet yuma really awesome experience on all fronts so definitely go for a special occasion dinner for was about ish all in
super cute spot albeit a little out of the way in alphabet city from what i saw and tasted this place is the real deal even all the employees there are italian with heavy accents pretty short and sweet menu divided into appetizers pastas all made fresh inhouse and meats at the beginning of your meal you get complimentary bread and they also come by with a basket full of wines for you to choose from if youre in the mood for a glass note that they dont really have fancy cocktails unless you want the classics like a martinithis place does classic and simple really well the of us shared the followingburrata e pomodorini and simple just fresh burrata cheese and grape tomato but it tasted extra freshhhh with the tomatoes chilled beforehand good startcrostone fagiolino liver prosciutto cotto mushroomsbest dish of the night for sure we at first got one order which came with crostinis since we had people we decided to ask them to add one more which we would pay for probably some language barriersmiscommunication but we ended up getting another order of it except this time it came with larger pieces of crostini haha it was so good we didnt mind getting more of it everything on there is so light yet so flavorful the prosciutto is delicate enough where you dont tug everything off the crostini in one bite and the raw mushrooms shaved on top really lift the whole dish up must getttttagliatelle bolognese tagliatelle with beef ragout this pasta was the perfect al dente spaghetticon bottarga was an interesting dishwhen he described it i honestly thought it was going to be like spaghetti with a shaving of bonito haha i guess it is pretty much like that but with a finer dusting of bottarga mullet the pasta is like a thinner and squigglyer version of spaghetti al dente to perfection but i couldnt quite taste the bottarga would probably not get this againpolpette al sugo another simple dish meatballs in tomato sauce probably a little aggressive in charging for this dish meatballs but they were good id probably get more pastas instead of this dish if i ever went backspecialwe also got the special pasta of the day but i cant remember what it was called ill upload a picture so look there but it looked like perfectly plump and fat dumplings the filling tasted like a spinach based filling and it was fantastic if i remember correctly it came with a simple sage butter sauceeverything was pretty delicious and the restaurant is as cute as a button not as mom and popy as bianca but i think this is a pretty good alternative i still miss bianca though
what can beat wine flights during happy hour you can pick from a variety of whites and reds glasses for just its basically free in my eyes am√©lie is a great date spot super intimate and cozy it can get really dark and although i hate the lighting the food makes up for it there are about seats at the bar and tables it gets extremely busy so call really ahead of time to ensure a table the wait staff are extremely nice they all have great accents i wish they can speak to me all day long if possible must get goat cheese ball if youre a fan of cheese please try this they serve this with an unlimited amount of bread so just spread it on your bread and eat eat eat then order another one and eat some more its super flavorful and creamy you wont be disappointedfor some reason i always end up getting octopus at a french restaurant try the grilled octopus salad the octopus is tender and the salad makes you think youre eating healthyi have also tried the escargot which wasnt too impressive you can go withoutif you havent had enough cheese order a charcuterie and cheese board if youre like me and have no idea how to pair meats and cheese ask the servers for help you can never go wrong with a charcuterie board im so glad i found this cute little place ill be back very soon
make a reservation sit at the sushi bar look over the list of sushi available for today check off your favorites and shudder at the fact that you may be paying for one piece of sushi or get omakase if youre okay with letting go of control once in awhile drink the matcha tea smile a wide smile at the newly assembled sushi that the chef has delicately placed in front of you put the sushi in your mouth and happycry a little okay a lot at how every component is perfectly executed from the light squeeze of fresh lemon on the oyster to the coarse sea salt on the white eel repeat as often as possible some its called sushi yasuda not sashimi yasuda carbs are good for your spirit and you dont want to miss the rice here go for the you do not necessarily have to get omakase for the best experience here if you know what you like mustorder pieces for me are the east coast uni oyster three different types of eels and toro scallion hand the sushi matsu is a great way to taste different types of sushi and half a roll at a lower price point you can order some more premium pieces to finish its acceptable to eat with your hands so ditch the chopsticks or god forbid ditch the fork you know who you are
walking down the block after leaving the restaurant feeling euphoric walking past gramercy tavern a few doors down i just came to the realization that this is the place to be in there is nothing like this in nyc and makes other nyc institutions feel so years ago having eaten at two of the restaurants owned by the same chef in tel aviv a number of years ago totally blown away i couldnt wait when i heard he was going to open his first restaurant in the us it has a casual yet refined and lively atmosphere with much anticipation the two of us went a bit overboard and ordered date donuts excellent absolute must have smoked eggplant caviar extremely creative utterly speechless must have palestinian tartar interesting tartar very good foie gras generous tender and creamy grilled foie gras with crunchy condiments perhaps the best and most creative foie gras ive ever had absolute must have sea bass tender perfectly cooked served with eggplant cream must have octopus extremely tender and beautifully presented very good but a tad rich all dishes have a generous portion and are meant to be shared and i totally agree even if your date or friend is not a big sharer i would strongly encourage to share at least main dishes following the date donuts they do not serve a free bread basket so we ordered kubaneh which was like a combination of brioche and croissant im not usually a big fan of kubaneh but this was excellent i also saw other tables eating jerusalem sesame bagel which looked delicious the cocktails were also outstanding the manager told us that the cocktail menu was developed by a well known mixologist who worked at eleven madison and other institutions consistent with the food the cocktails were extremely innovative yet refined of the we tried my favorites were nur york harvest bourbon must have clore park swizzle arak must have and old fashioned very good the space is casual but sophisticated i think its good for dates friends or for business or just drinks at the bar im sure its going to become extremely popular and hard to get a table but for now its a hidden gem which will surely impress whoever you want to impress
my friend recommended unfade to me as she got her hair colored by roy roy being the boss man had limited availability and also a higher price tag so i took a look at yelp to see which other stylists i could consider leo got great reviews and i was impressed by his work on his instagram so i decided on him i wanted to turn my mostly virgin asian black hair into a rooty dusty pink cloud leo was fantastic we had a half hour long consult and he explained very thoroughly what i could or could not expect and what my options wereleo was definitely very knowledgeable about color theory and has a great eye for colors that work together i enjoyed how articulate he was about the technical aspect of hair coloring it made communication a breeze since i enjoyed being equally technical he recommended blending my hair with a purple into the dusty pink and the end result is even better than i expected the whole thing about rounds of bleaching i cant remember and a color melt set me back about well worth the hours he put in and the beautiful result

after having drinks around the block my friend mentioned we had to come here for some food she said it was a must try long line but moves rather quickly easy to choose menu items we had the adobada chicken tacos with everything lord all mighty what is going on here it was like a flavor party in my mouth with the adobada which is pork so good nice tasting meat great with the extras on top guacamole cheese tomatoes etc wow amazing chicken tacos not far behind also delicious great tasting meat add all the extras even better located inside the chelsea market this place is basically a small food stand only thing that surprised me here are their hours of operations u would think that with some many drinking choices in the area this place would be open a little later hard for me to believe i didnt know about this place sooner glad i do now wow delicious tacos quick service cheap prices just cant go wrong
jiggly cakes cake can be misleading because its more like a fluffy bread custard made throughout the day so definitely fresh cheese souffle cake is hands down the best has traces amount of creamcheese kind of taste in the middle of the cake super moist and heavenly i can imagine having this with coffee in the morning whole cake is about i love their brown cardboard packaging that keeps the jiggly cake uncrushed through the busy streets of chinatown great for gifts toomatcha is a bit dry regular is alright these are bit cheaper
this place was great i was here with my fianc√© and a few friends on a friday even after several drinks and quite a lot of food the bill was extremely reasonable the pernil tacos were probably the best ive ever had authentic but with their own delicious twist tons of flavor we kept ordering more i cant wait to go back asap the owner was very handson walking around making sure everything was running smoothly each booth had its own tv screen as well which was pretty cool great place all around
let me start this off by saying im a fiercely loyal believer in the statute new jersey pizza is superior to all other pizzalittle italy makes me question my core beliefsthe chicken ricotta pizza is mindnumbing i have fever dreams about the chicken ricotta pizza the chicken ricotta pizza has changed the timeline of my life multiple times especially the time my friend and i waltzed in there at and gavoned several slices if little italy is church the chicken ricotta pizza is its god if youre out of your mind and dont get the chicken ricotta pizza the plain pizza gives all other plain pizzas a marathon run for their money i cant personally vouch for the grandmas pizza but my dad whos been named top connoisseur of all grandmas pizza pies in northern new jersey says little italys is among the best hes hadthe delivery service is alarmingly quick so you dont have to pace across your living room for too long while you wait for the pie of your dreams to knock at your door theres an old saying about pizza that goes something along the lines of when pizza is that good surrender your life to it little italy should have this quote painted into a phantasmagoric mural on their wall
one of my favorite places for ice cream in the city fun and unique flavors the earl grey tea and honeycomb are two of my absolute favorites plus lots of vegan flavors the west village location is small so its perfect in the summer time to come for a scoop and an iced coffee togo to walk around with
excited for wowfulls first brick and mortar perhaps most experienced in tenure in churning out waffles day after day at events smorg this iteration seals the deal on offer are coconut chocolate and coffee waffles with their usual selection of ice cream to keep the lines moving smoothlyi picked the a home sweet home taste is as good as ive remembered it at smorg waiting in the lines however theyve tweaked perhaps even perfected the taste of their regular waffle crisp puffy and only mildly sweet allowing for the toppings and ice cream to do the rest of the work as sweetenersan amazing experience even if i have to wait for them to churn out waffles at a time each the staff is really upbeat and i remember them all from smorgthe decor is really sleek honeycomb shaped woodword adorn one wall and a whole hearts art wall adorn the other a very fun place to be of course the only tip i have to leave for you is to go early during there grand opening mode
ive recently been on a mexican crave and was so happy to find a brand new choza that just opened inside the gotham west market i got the tacos with chicken carnitas pork and steak corn elote on the sidethe tacos arent huge in fact theyre very cute size about inches across but theyre packed with flavor and the meats are very well braised and marinated like most soft shell places the tortillas are double layered which i find a bit unnecessary i just eat one layer but the key is in the mix of meats cheeses salsas and toppings perfect balance and blend of spices what really stood out was actually the corn most taco joints dont have corn on the cob and the mix of sprinkled cheese and sauce on sweet corn made it high addicting and uniqueglad to have a taco joint near my apartment
ube soft serve say no more soft swerve is a trendy new ice cream establishment with creamy ice cream bold flavors and quality ingredients after sampling all of the flavors i thought the ube was very unique it tasted slightly like taro but i can definitely see this being their top seller i was told that it is made with actual chunks of ube in it you should definitely order this with the toasted coconut although all of the flavors were delicious matcha turned out to be my absolute favoritetheir black sesame ice cream had a very strong black sesame flavor which i love i will no longer have to go all the way to mitsuwa for the rich flavor i also love their custom made chocolate cones you can taste the chocolate but it is not a overwhelming flavor the cone is crispy but not too sweet perfect to go with any flavor of ice cream that they offer my friend ordered the strawberry shortcake it looks very presentable and the added crunch makes this a recommended item this reminds me of a better version of the strawberry sundaes that we used to enjoy as a kid it has a vanilla base dried strawberries crushed golden oreos and strawberry drizzle i will be back again soon
i tried the banana pudding and it was delightful the pudding was tasty and they crumbled banana bread and blobs of caramel into the pudding the chocolate chip pretzel cookies was also delicious very hardy great taste complementing the sweet with salty also sarah is a dollshes so lovely
an amazing time and experience at the clocktower which went much better than anticipated i made a reservation a month before for my boyfriends birthday and i was so glad i made the choice of clocktower the food was absolutely delicious atmosphere was perfect for a celebratory occasion and service was attentive and unpretentious five starsbonus point that my boyfriend had a really great time and very much enjoyed his birthday dinner and who doesnt want to try to impress their loved one on their birthdayfor those of you like myself who have limited exposure with a very basic understanding of british food this is a place to try or rather it is a must try the menu looked outstanding upon reading but note it all comes at a bit of a steep but all worth it price i wanted to find a place that was somewhat fancy but without the necessites of a particular dress code you can come and be yourself it borders between casual but high end enough for any special occasion there are three rooms plus the main bar we sat in the middle room or what i call the hollywood room with framed pictures upon pictures of well known celebrities the lighting is nice and dim at night for what felt like a mostly intimate but comfortably spacious space for two people to converse meanwhile food and drink i personally thought amazing cocktails are a worthwhile try all of which were expert mixtures and a lovely complement to our meals give peas a chance was our favorite of the night a mixture of bombay gin yellow chartreuse salted pea cordial lemon juice fresh mint butterfly absinthe and egg white the los pollos hermanos ode to breaking bad perhaps was refreshing as well we ordered some appetizers doz bucket of oysters bits and bobs and quail frumenty scotch egg with wild mushrooms tea liver parfait for main i had the colorado lamb spiced pistachio crust mixed grains caramelized yogurt artichokes my bf had the berkshire pork chop piccalilli black pudding crackling apple sauce we loved our dishes i tried some of his pork chop which was succulent and tender my lamb chop was real tender and slid easily right off the bone i would get this again but i would also be curious to try one of their seafood dishes like the sole or halibut we ended our meals with a bit of dessert but a bit might be an understatement the pink lady apple tarte tatin for two madagascar vanilla ice cream could have fed people easily but i would go for this in a heartbeat again it was a truly sweet end to our meal overall a really pleasant experience at the clocktower and a successful birthday dinner for the two of us i would recommend it for a special occasion if you are looking for this sort of experiencefood its not over the top but fancy enough to satisfy a more celebratory occasion otherwise i would definitely return for brunch or lunch and see their offerings during the day the dinner was exceptional and i was very happy with the clocktower in its entirety hopefully your experience will speak the same on your first visit because i highly recommend
cafe bari has saved my ass too many times i work in soho which is very very far from where i live though i tend to make coffee at home before work i will occasionally need a second or third or fourth cup due to the nature of my job some use nicotine as a stimulant some use caffeine i happen to like my lungs clear and healthy so i choose the latter cafe bari along with being comically convenient has fabulous coffee served by fabulous folks in fabulously fast time cant ask for much more than that in a neighborhood coffeeshop convenient you ask cafe bari is both subwayconvenient and officeconvenient in my very specific case you can pretty much step right off the subway platform at canal street and right into cafe bari i also happen to work on east broadway which is a wasteland when it comes to togo options bari is just steps from my office so roundtrip plus orderingwaiting is about five minutes theres a starbucks equidistant from my office but i virtually never go there now that ive discovered bariim from philly hold the boos please so i grew up being taken to la colombe in manayunk my parents are big coffeedrinkers as well so i started young my coffee knowledge is slightly above remedial but i can at least tell the difference between dunkin donuts starbucks coffee bean or what used to be coffee bean and a more artisan place like bari namely that bari is head and shoulders like shaqs head and shoulders any of that chain crap when i heard that bari served la colombe coffee i ran over there within the hour even better than i remembered probably because im a working adult now and not a teenager wanting to get into coffee because my parents made it seem cool i told you this couldve just as easily been cigarettes and thank god its not bari has your standard offerings as far as cafes go like a lot of these hipster places they only have two sizes the large is about the size of a starbucks grande if you need a reference point my goto drink there is a large almond milk cappucino which is if youre worried about quantity i suppose you should go corporate but i promise you that quality over quantity is a particularly salient argument in this case theyve got that awesome almond milk there thats specifically made for coffee which makes a huge difference add in one of those lovely steamed milk hearts atop each drink and now youve got coffee and a smile ah yes a smile a genuine smile not a routine getoutofmyfacesoicangettothenextcustomerandimreallyexasperated kind of smile the staffbaristas at cafe bari are fabulous everyones nice everyones friendly and theyve got awesome taste in music today i walked in and they were blasting britney then nsync then spice girls a magical tbt service is fast product is topnotch though i cant speak to the abundance of pastries here i can report that my coworker comes in with a chocolate croissant from cafe bari every morning and devours it so i can directly say theyre delicious i suppose pretty sure everything that comes out of this smallbutmighty shop is a slam dunk
a more suited named for this delightfully delicious confectionary shop should be hidden cakes as it is located on street down the staircase in the basement of a brownstone building these are the types of shops you love for their uniqueness as you walk in assuming down the stair case not sure what to expect you find your self in a cramped hallway infront of the entrance door as you open the door you are greeted by the joyous bakers in the shop who are working on their next masterpiece when you get to the counter you see all the cookies and cupcakes that all look scrumdidlyumptous i selected the nuetella macadamian nut half pound cookie and the snicker doodle half pound cookie they were both just as good as they looked the texture to flavor it was just cooked to perfection though i must say the nutella cookie was betterin short scrumdidlyumptous half pound cookies friendly bakers hard to find basement shop

polpette we finally met i have walked by many days thought the menu looked amazing and kept forgetting about it when it came to dinner my mistake was i didnt bookmark it on yelp as a seasoned yelper i made a rookie mistakei called to make a reservation since most of the reviews state that there tends to be a wait they only take reservations for or more that are made hours in advance they have a small bar if you do have to wait the bartender seemed very friendly with everyone seated at the bar the lemon martini is excellent its which is fair for a good martini we snagged the last table for so no wait for us around on a saturday in general i like this spot a lot because his prices are reasonable for quality food and drinks i hope he keeps it this way because his model is definitely working to begin they serve a delicious basket of bread with oil the bread had a seasoning in it that i like i think it was rosemary we ordered the meatball sliders and a caesar salad we noticed most people did try the meatballs since they state on their menu that its their item they are well known for the meatballs were tender and bursting with flavor there was just enough sauce on the meatball so all the flavors could be enjoyed it comes with a tasty salad once again impressive that for the sliders were served with a salad the salad had a light flavorful dressing which made me think next time id try another salad other than caesar the dressing tasted homemade my hunny really enjoyed the caesar salad too i ordered the lobster ravioli with shrimp in a vodka sauce for it typically comes with a white cream sauce but im all about vodka sauce so the waiter was more than happy to swap it the portion was excellenti managed to eat it all it was so delicious i couldnt stop eating the vodka sauce was creamy i think it had cabbage sprinkled on top which added a nice crunch and presented well the two shrimp on it were large and fresh the ravioli were overflowing with lobster and cheese i was impressed by their large selection of homemade pasta dishes im a huge fan of homemade pasta ill be back for the squid ink linguini the staff were all very friendly attentive and knowledgeable i feel that its rare to find such good service with reasonable prices in manhattan im scared to hit save on this review because i really want our table for to waiting for us my hunny and i agreed we found our new neighborhood spot finally

not your typical hole in the wall viet place madame vo is super modern with its decor and hip hop music bumpin in the background the quality of the food is really good though and the best viet place ive found in the city so farcame with a group of so we ordered a bunch of dishes to make it family stylebanh xeo love getting this at viet places egg crepe with prawns pork and sprouts this one had a bit of a sweeter taste to it but good nonetheless madame pho w short rib really good pho as in the broth and noodles were made really well the short rib is huge and tendergarlic noodles really really good all i need to sayspring rolls classic cant go wrongfried squid the batter they use to fry it is amazing because the chunks of fried squid were so light and crispygiant platter hefty amount of food great for sharing we probably ordered too much but it was all so goodnot the cheapest food youll find in nyc but definitely worth it
dont judge a book by its cover is the perfect idiom for shu jiao fu zhou i was confused upon arriving at the restaurant by whether or not ive actually found it think the sign outside isnt of its full name even as i stepped inside i wasnt fully convinced i was at the right place its a frugal no fluff holeinthewallbut oh boy can they cook the dumplings wheat noodles rice balls and fish balls are excellent and so so cheap entrees came out to be we left a generous tip because of the price and how friendly the staff was turns out you can definitely eat well in new york with bucks or less the only thing i didnt really care for was the beef tripe soup everything else was authentic and top notchdo i foresee a michelin star in its future
fantastic dining experience at the gander on a weekday evening with a group of girls upon arriving we were warmly greeted and then led to a round family style table in the back personally i am a huge fan of round tables with a large party since it makes it easier to share dishes which is exactly what we didwe tried a mix of appetizers and entrees with plenty of drinks to go around everything from the parmesan butter bread to the brisket tots to the selected cheese plate was spot on and ideal for sharing i particularly loved and will come back for the warm lentil appetizer with the gooey poached egg so not something i would normally order but so worth every bite will i be back for sure but i think the gander is ideally the type of spot for a large group so you can sample a variety of options given they are all so unique itd be cool to see an mixed appetizer sampling given the many varied and delicious dishes
kingsbridge social club or as i have decided to call it kbs opened recently in the bronx its a great addition to the neighborhood while the bronx obviously has no shortage of pizzerias kbs is so much more than that woodfired specialty pizzas with toppings ranging from quail eggs to meatballs plus sandwiches salads and unique appetizers we ordered the house pie one of their daily specials a pie with herbed chicken flor di latte and sweet peppers we also got the meatballs as an appetizer meatballs were really delicious the sauce they were in was also amazing even though i believe it was a simple homemade marinara the bread that came with it was also warm delicious the pies were both great as wellnow usually i dont condone the use of all caps ahem mr trump if youre reading take note however what im about to say requires it they have prosecco on tap and red wine im not even sure what makes this so exciting except that i didnt know it was possible we actually stuck with beers last night but next time rest assured i will be tapping that pun intended beer offerings are good i wish they would clarify a little better which are draft can bottle it was a little confusing also in case someone from the restaurant is reading ill fully forgive it for now since theyre so new but the waiter definitely needs some additional training on beer styles appearancesthe physical space is small but cute the decor is interesting dave the owner manager was available and friendly pitching in where needed making sure everyone was happy all in all i really enjoyed my experience and i cant wait to go back try some more pies and get my prosecco on
italian tacos fancy sandwich pocketsmouthwatering roman street food quick bites imagine all of those savory italian dishes that are not so portable being more portable thats exactly what italian chef stefano callegari did and its goodcame to meet a friend and was not hungry or in the mood for a sandwich tried a couple bites of their braised pork with rosemary and fennel pollen and the riceball of the day both were delicious no doubt i will be backthe pork was hearty the flavor was rich the bread was tender with just the right amount of crisp it was hollowed out not too thick so if you are shy about the carbs its good this feels like a warm crust with the center dug out the savory flavors inside will remind you of a home cooked meal i can see why this was such a hit in romethe price seems reasonable for a snack considering the ingredients however if you are hungry you may end up buying a couple of sandwiches think pizza slice or an italian tacosthe sitting area is relatively small you can push tables together if you are a large group however as this is a quick bites type of place it is doubtful you will have a large group in tow if youre walking through the neighborhood definitely stop bythe scene casual quickbites heartydestination rating rating nob potential suggestion come here if youre hungry and in a hurry
my favorite spot for gelato not only is the presentation beautiful amorinos gelato is creamy and luscious absolutely delicious there are so many flavors to choose from and you get to pick as many flavors as you want just have to pick the size small medium or large each flavor becomes a petal and forms gorgeously into a flower shape looks like a rose you can also top it with a macaroon like we did pi believe amorinos originally from france i remember when the first store in nyc opened near nyu on university pl years back and that was a big deal now theres a amorino on uws as well as the theater district and here in chelsea i was quite excited when i found this location last weekend
this place is awesome best bang for your buck near times square in my opinion how it works is you pick one base pita hummus bowl salad rice and then a protein the rest is an unlimited onetime toppings bar sort of like a chipotle for mediterranean food but you put the toppings on yourselffood yummy and fresh i loved that they had sooooo many options and all vegetarian they have beets chickpeas radish cabbage and plenty of sauces to choose from this place a veggie haven also serving size is big enough to eat for two meals cost decent there are a few toppings that you can choose to add on to your base that are extra but id say skip that and just bulk up on the free toppings d it costs about depending on what base and protein you decide to get service very friendly staff it was my first time trying it and i was confused as to how things work and the staff was very accommodating and friendly to explain they also made me fresh chicken shawarma since the other was sitting out for a while will be back its in a prime location although that can cause a bit of a hold up during busy lunch hours prices are decent staff is friendlyill definitely be back
popped in here totally out of the blue and boy were we glad to have found this hidden gem the cocktails were unique and strong but beware of the hot buttered rum this little guy is butteryrich af it might clog your arteries if you havent been working out i was secretly glad it was my bf who ordered it and not me because i wouldnt have been able to finish it i also tried the flawless victory and midnight society and had a sip of bfs untold story all excellent bartender was super friendly as well ambience was dark and intimate good for a date spot we didnt order any food but it sure smelled delicious whatever it was will definitely return if im ever in the area again and looking for a good cocktail
i recently heard word about this modern israeli spot in ev and decided to dine here as my latest treat yoself meal not sure about you but i find most of the spots i have saved up to visit are all new american italian cuisine whereas mediterraneanisraeli spots are usually on the casual side so found this midprice and classy spot as a great change of pace timna is located just slightly below ground and has a quaint but polished atmosphere and an amazing staff who is eager to suggest their favorite dishes the bartender i interacted with was straight from israel and the only one in his family in america and suggested a few amazing israeli wines for me to try and they were excellent who knew israel has the good juicei ordered the cauliflower dish as a starter along with the must order bread that comes in a clay pot while i enjoyed the bread the flavors in the cauliflower dish and accompanying sauce were outstanding vegetarian or not for my main i went with the roasted carrots on farro again accompanied with two masterfully paired sauceswhile most people me included would expect some upscale hummus falafel hell maybe even a kickass tabbouleh from this place timna goes above and beyond these basic dishes to create new creative and flavorful dishes
ive lived in this city for close to years but with the exception of my local bodega i have yet to become a regular at any one particular spot ive gone to great bars restaurants and cafes but because i love trying somewhere new ill almost always opt for an unfamiliar place over a familiar one chochin is one of the few places that i will work very hard to be a regular at at first i was quite surprised to find a homey hole in the wall serving up japanese homestyle cooking in the middle of yorkville given that most of the japanese places around here are generic sushi takeout spots well east villages loss is my gain because as soon as we stepped outside after our meal we made plans to come back the following weekend to try more dishes when we first came in at around right when it opened i had a brief moment of panic that this place wouldnt survive the lack of foot traffic around this second avenueadjacent neck of the woods then the place filled up to capacity within minutes so definitely come here right when it opens especially if your group is more than people the menu is in english but everything else may as well have been imported from japan theres one guy in the very back making all the food the waitress manning the former sushi counter was very sweet and explained each dish as she brought it out but she didnt know things like byob or leaving a partys name down while they wait which is completely fine because the homecooked food more than makes up for it lately ive been fiending hard for japanesestyle comfort dishes and chochin lantern handily delivers this is what we ordered ranked in order of how much i loved spicy tuna don my stars this was as far away from the gunky spicy mayoslathered mess that other places tend to serve if there was any mayo which i absolutely loathe in this dish i could barely taste it the rice was cooked to perfection buttery soft with a hint of vinegar whole tomato soup perfect for a freezing winter night it comes as a tomato sitting in a lake of cheese inside the tomato is the softestboiled egg you ever did see it sounds like a childrens tale but its really the best thing ive eaten all week the miso soup that came as a side to my spicy tuna rice bowl this one tasted like it was brewed from scratch and didnt have that immediate umami bomb that other places soup delivers but still tasted wonderfully hearty the hamburger appetizer it tasted more like meatloaf than your usual burger patty daikon salad eat some veggies yo fried oysters i dont really like oysters in general and im trying to wean myself off fried stuff in time for the summer months so this was doomed from the getgo in my book but my boyfriend liked it cash only place is tight so tight that if you come here with even the barest hint of a cold youll drive away your neighbors in disgust ie dont come here when youre sick and nursing a tub of robitussin ill be back in a few days
man oh man its probably been a good weeks or so since i ate at post yet here i am still dreaming about their avocado biscuit with chicken sausage seriously guys this place has without a doubt one of the best damn biscuits ive ever eaten in my entire life and let me tell ya my carbloving ass has eaten a lotttt of biscuits over the years its moist giggity thick giggity giggity ridiculously flavorful and i want at least a half dozen of them delivered to me right now the chicken sausage i added on was also such a great idea because it was also so flavorful and it just made my biscuit that much better and meatier this little gem just opened up a few weeks ago so there is currently only bar seating but dont let that deter you in fact i would actually highly recommend hightailing your asses there asap so you can get one or two or ten of those biscuits before this place really blows up and the lines become insane or actually wait maybe dont so i can have all of that biscuit goodness to myself yeah lets go with that find your own dang biscuit place guys
i literally wanted to eat everything here so many choices and great prices my friend and i got noodles and crab xlb soup dumplings and the total was each of our noodles came with a side of broth which was clean and perfect to wash down the noodles and their xlb were nice too thin wrapper with just the right amount of broth insideservice was quick and attentive and i loved that the food wasnt super oily their congee looked great its a perfect place to get a bunch a dishes and share family style will be back for sure
so i think it is safe to say thai villa has given some of my favorite thai spots in nyc a run for their money they are reasonably priced the decor is beautiful and the food is amazing i have been eyeing this bookmark i have saved forever mostly due to that beautiful new hot tag first time i dined with them was for pick up for lunch since i work close by their lunch prices range in the dollar range which i think is reasonable due to the excellent portion sizes it comes with two sides as well the second time i decided to dine with them it was for lunch but i did nab a seat at the bar for lunch with a friend she is a yelp eliter and was blown away by the decor once arriving and then the food wowed her as well once getting back to the office we were immediately planning our next lunch at this spot the bartender definitely added to the experience by being personablein terms of the food my favorite is the pad kra prow with chicken they will ask if you want it spicy and i dont recommend getting spicy if you cannot deal with heat and i would recommend stating you would like it mild this is a great place for a date large parties or if you happen to be in the flatironchelsea area and want great quality thaii normally post pictures of food when i go out to dine but each time i go i just dive into my food bookmark this place and make sure you go
my favorite japanese bakery quick lunch spot in tribeca they make their pastries and sandwiches fresh each day without any preservatives the bake goods are so fresh and warm if you come early in the morning they have tables and chairs if you want to dine in green tea matcha crepe a must try if you are visiting it is soft and creamy with red bean filling matcha latte tastes a bit like the matcha latte from starbucks but a little less sweet the price for the medium and the large size is the sametuna tataki salad i really like this salad it is seared ahi tuna with some snow peas shredded carrots a few blueberries banana peppers and a piece or two of broccoli in the mixed greens with wasabi vinaigrette dressing on the sidespicy tuna bread a savoy pastry it is crispy on the outside and warm on the inside the tuna used for this pastry is cookedmatcha croissant i liked it it has creamy matcha filling in the centerspicy salmon avocado sandwich with cucumber this is really goodsmoked salmon sandwich with lettuce cream cheese cucumber red onion this is also really good kind of reminded me of smoked salmon bagel tuna avocado sandwich with lettuce this is tastyegg salad sandwich with tomatoes creamy and delicious mochi an pan personally i dont like this one because i found it heavy matcha roll cake green tea flavored cake with red bean filling the green part is kind of dry and the red bean filling have an orange zest flavor sweet cheese puff i like it the cheese is light and a bit sweetthey accept credit cards except for american express
two words grandpa pizza so good we ordered from addeos twice and both times we got that pizza its a fresh thin crust sicilian pie topped with actual tomatoes and basil i want to say that theres slices in all we definitely had leftovers the next day its a hefty but its worth it for the qualityweve only had experience with this business via delivery but have not been disappointed im very happy with their quality delivery time and courtesy of the drivers and people whove taken our orders over the phone
memories from the corner of my mindrainy day memories my morning snack was a piece of ny style cheesecake from two little red hens i cant tell you how happy i am that this great little bakery has survived the avenue subway construction i had no problem at am getting a seat so i could enjoy my cheesecake i am a cheesecake factory fanatic but i have to say this is the best ny cheesecake in the city i enjoyed looking at all the goodies before i made my decision there are scones cookies cupcakes pies and cherry cheesecake too the service was very fast and pleasant employees the place is clean and well stocked with napkins and anything else you need to enjoy your desert if it wasnt for my health id be here every day for a different treat i do plan to return soon for the peanut butter cupcake they were huge you definitely owe it to yourself to stop by for a treat when youre in the neighborhood
tenth avenue in hells kitchen has long been a no mans land when it comes to the restaurant scene the only mainstays over the last several years have been pio pio x and a few years ago along came farmtotable the marshal bringing with it a new ambiance and cuisine to the area it is the success of the marshal that allowed the introduction of dianne elisabeth by the same owner just down the block a quaint wine bar that also includes fresh produce and eclectic mains and various varietals of wine you cant get just anywhere having visited dianne elisabeth a few times now i can say the service the food and drink and the ambiance is consistently exceptional my favorite wine on the menu which i recommend very highly is the counoise a red varietal that is mediumbodied and not too sweet yet not bitter and it is a perfect reasonablypriced wine in fact its the only wine i choose to order here on to the menu spicy marinated pineapple huge pieces of pineapple seasoned nicely langostino poppers beer battered langostinos lemon garlic thyme aioli so far this is the best plate ive tried on the menu each popper is verrry meaty and only lightly battered beet apple fennel salad with blue cheese caraway and a red wine honey vinaigrette this was the perfect balance of the sweetness of the apple with the bitterness of the beets presented beautifully croquettes pork lardon swiss cheese smoked paprika cream im generally not a fan of dishes on the creamier and cheesier side only a personal preference but these are definitely worthwhile if you are so far ive only been for wine and apps but the rest of the menu looks awesome hopefully ill get the opportunity to go back again soon and try more when it comes to ambiance and service i must say george the bartender and emilio the service have been nothing but kind and professional plus sitting at the bar having a glass of wine you never know who youll meet in the neighborhood its one of those very inviting cozy and warm atmospheres that is great addition to the neighborhood plus its a great date spot too although for now its only open for dinner

i ate alot of spaghetti in collegei think the only things i could cook were mashed potatoes scrambled eggs boil spaghetti and make cereal it was a bachelor nightmaremaybe thats why my mind went a little blank at my plate of wonderful spaghetti at spaghetti incident the room was handsome dimly lit with a brick wall mirrors with cute planters underneath it felt like a little italian home miles away from the lower east side poser scenean adroit young man with a new bass voice who couldnt have been had the grace and poise of the best waiter i ever had he checked on me just enough was warm with enough distance and quickly recommended his favorite dishes with descriptions and without hesitation the kitchen is open and i could smell my spaghetti with salsciccia cooking with garlic pork and white wine the pasta is house made and al dente a treasure confirmed by the happy italians dining next to meglasses for montepulciano were a breezy and generous i opted for a second glass over the panna cotta a not so easy decision but the place is cash only so i wanted to have enough to leave a generous tipthis cozy bistro is a little gem if you love spaghetti and if you dont you should come for the small plates and desserts and drink wine which ill do in the very near future atmosphere cozy and wonderfulfood clean fresh simple and homemade
as a skeptic of any cha siu place that isnt a hole in the wall i was blown away by the deliciousness quality of the food here in addition to the atmosphere cleanliness and friendliness of the waiters crispy roast duck in the mantou sandwich was super flavorful and i highly recommend it i was expecting a small mantou with a little bit of duck for a pricey but boy i was wrong huge mantou with a bit of that duck fat grease and enough pieces of duck that youd see on an entree prepare for this to be messy to eat naturally just pick up the duck pieces that fall out with your fork and add some of their heavenly chili sauce to it the five spice short rib plate with egg noodles was surprisingly tasty as well short rib is fall off the bone except they make it even easier and take out the bones already topped with a bunch of garlicky saucy garnishes including braised daikon it was super delicious my only feedback is that the egg noodles were a tad soggy and a tiny bit bland though that might have been bc i didnt mix some parts of it well as everything else was bursting with flavor but this was entirely made up for when sprinkling some of their garlic chili flakes and oil admittedly an entire mantou sandwich and egg noodles plate was too much for one person but im glad i tried both and was pleasantly surprised at the big portion sizes ill be back again for that crispy roast duck
tldr for those who are confused about msbs familystyle option and whether you should come with a large group or whether its worth it to come with a small dining party yes the food is delicious but your dining experience will be quite different i came here for dinner with a friend and we ordered the fried duck dumplings steamed pork buns not on the menu fried brussels sprouts and seared pork ribsthe steamed pork buns were excellent the buns were pillowy soft but just firm enough to hold up to tender braised pork and boy was the kitchen generous with the pork the accompanying pickled cucumbers provided a nice acidity and textural contrast this was served with ssam sauce which tasted like a lighter gochujang sauce korean chili paste honestly the pork buns are pretty much perfect as is i think adding the ssam sauce is a disservice the fried brussels sprouts were yummmmmy the fish sauce was not overpowering as it was balanced by an herb mixture that made it more of an assertive vinaigrette to coat the perfectly fried brussels sprouts the duck in the duck dumplings was just ok i couldnt really discern the taste of the duck itself but i thought the crispy wanton with a sea salt crust and the mint sauce were excellent the seared pork ribs were succulent they were marinated in gochu sauce and then seared somehow i thought the glaze on top was more teriyaki then gochu but i loved the smokey umami flavor as well as the toasted sesame seeds and the spice from the scallions it was quite tender and fell off the bone that we could eat the ribs with silverwarehowever i think this dish is improperly labeled under ssam ssam means lettuce wrap in korean so i thought the ribs would be accompanied by lettuce or some kind of veggies but the dish was just five giant pieces of ribs our waitress was gracious enough to bring over some lettuce when i asked but i dont think it makes sense for the main entree to be just hunks of meat without any veggies regardless i saw that the grilled porgy comes with tortillas for you to make fish tacos with at the table so i think the label is appropriate depending on what you order but dont expect all of the ssam courses to come out in the lettuce wrap style like you would for the familystyle option we finished the meal with the creme brulee which is highly recommended the custard is matcha infused with thai basil the perfume of that and the brulee on top are heavenly my god i can have this all to myself and i would still want more i cant wait to come back to try their seafood donabe as the table next to me ordered it and it looked delectable with so much seafood id order all of the above dishes again in a heartbeat except for the duck dumplings
nothing man produces in my opinion could ever surpass the beauty found in nature but in some instances mans genius comes close coming on the heels of the spectacular orchid exhibit here is another stunner the dale chihuly exhibit this artist has managed with hand blown colored glass to mold creations that evoke images of flamingoes stars sea anemones and other fantastical forms some are huge impressive structures as tall as trees with squiggly swirly extensions that fascinate and capture the eye others resemble ordinary objects like balls only dazzling in their color combinations all are intriguing this is a stellar exhibit that i recommend seeing in various lights on a cloudy day during a sunny day and during extended evening hours when they are lit up even if you see it only once the exhibit will impress and of course the gardens themselves are always magnificent any timenote the dale chihuly exhibit is on until october if you go now you get the lovely cherry and lilac trees in bloom to enjoy while you stroll through the rest of the parkextra treat at the gardens birders should know that there is a pair of nesting great horned owls at the gardens now you wont be able to photograph them without a tripod and a long long telephoto bring your binoculars unless you care to stare at the fa√ßade of a building to seenothing

photorealisma genre of artencompassing extremely realistic painting drawing and other graphic mediain which the artwork is based entirely on a photographafter reading fellow yelper helens review i couldnt resist i took a mental note that i had to put this on my list of things to do after a very early morning great experience at the metropolitan museum of art i made my way over to the bernarducci meisel gallery i entered the gallery and stood and pondered in front of many of the arts on display mesmerized and amazed by the artistry upon first glance your eyes immediately see a photograph and then as you step closer the realization dawns on you that they are actually either a painting or drawingunbelievable for a long moment i stood and imagined myself seated with a glass of champagne continuing to listen to the mellow smooth jazz playing in the background and staring at these pieces thats how much i wanted to stay and immerse myself further a thank you goes to kimberly who kindly answered all of my many questions and also allowing me to catch a glimpse of their resident puppy while venturing farther throughout the gallery the arts of raphaella spence and emily copeland who i have now deemed among my favorites are on display with ester curini and others this current exhibit will end april and is a must see for those who can appreciate the arts current exhibit pricing and upupcoming exhibit size doesnt matter plus artists to participate april located on floor
came here on a breezy abnormally warm monday evening with a girl friend and i loved every minute of my dinner at boucheriei had noticed boucherie a month or so earlier while walking through the area i loved their open seating and bistro vibe of the joint and made a mental note to swing by on a warm night we were greeted warmly by our servers jose and niko and ordered a bunch of things to try out we hadsteak tartare small portion omg so good and such a healthy size too we finished it but totally doable to share among a group of they use the ends of their tenderloin steaks so this is top notch quality meatfrench onion soup a last minute add on but man such a good call delicious just the right amount of salt and the perf melty cheese duck confit the quintessential french dish so i just had to try it the smell of the truffle potatoes were intoxicating the greens were a little overly salted in some areas but i just made sure to mix well before eating hefty portion of duck as well ordered medium but i may go even below that next time as it was slightly tough lamb shank huuuuumongous portion couscous was perfectly cooked and for someone who isnt a fan of gamey meats i thought it was quite goodwe also had to order a side of fries after seeing the table next to us indulge in some best decision ever id go back just for the fries and some of that tartare we also ordered two old fashions which were okay was expecting something more from their drinks perhaps id try some of the wines next time and there will definitely be a next time between the great food superb ambiance amazing service and open kitchen to boot i am a super fan felt like i was transported back to paree
i love augustine came here with my family on an early sunday evening to celebrate my moms birthday and as one might expect at keith mcnally restaurant during opening week the restaurant was packed moody lighting antiquey accents and that overall glamorous brasserie feel make this one beautiful restaurant i think its also great to have such a great name down in the financial districtseaport area which is constantly and thankfully getting upgraded in terms of food options the service was warm professional and honestly there the restaurant was well staffed considering its not even a huge space much smaller than balthazar we had delicious amuse bouche of puffs with caviar a delicious bread basket not joking with seasoned olive oil and butter mixture of white and wheat bread the waldorf salad classic the foie gras the avocadocrab saladall the salads were super fresh as far the mains we all tried different things from the burger to the leg of lamb to the halibut special pork chop and uni pasta i had one bite of this and it was satisfying breadcrumb uni crab very good flavor and texture the dishes was very classic simple and just tastyi myself was torn between the duck lorange which i wish i had gotten now and the steak frite i got the latter the steak frite is so so delicious au poivre style with serious peppercorns and a sweet ish sauce the frites as they are at all of their restaurants are delicous i didnt try my hubbys lamb since he was across the table but he said it was really well done and enjoyed the beans in the end we got two desserts the seasonal apple tartin delicious and a napolean type of dessert both were so fresh and tasty i really thought the food here again was spoton re flavor and fresh ingredients its not the most experimental but the food is good and the space is beautiful so definitely worth visitng for dinner or drinks
i would love to get myself grounded here the entire time i was reading a book in a fresh green backyard free wifi super nice barista tea pots and coffee cups a tall bookshelf one red velvet sofa extra metal seats leafy plants with quirky chinese statues wall art for sales this coffee shop is almost like a west village thrift shop most items are unrelated but when assembled together they easily become part of the architecture writers and designers work better in an unorganized environment anyway your eyes shouldnt be bored in here the overall color is green but like a game of hidden objects the closer you look the more visual toys you find

worth the wait and definitely not just a gimmick of standing while you eat one of the best and cheapest steaks ive had i was surprised to see such a long line but it moved very quickly there was about people in front of me but i was able to get seated in an hour the smell when you walk in is heavenly the system works like a welloiled machine you would think that a bunch of diners standing around would make things chaotic but the staff who are some of the friendliest ive encountered in nyc swiftly took our drink and side orders before directing us to the cut to order station to pick out our steaks tip if dining for just two i highly recommend asking for the total grams of steak ie and then having it cut in half that way you get a thicker cut of steak which will be much juicier and tastier vs asking for two separate cuts there are plenty of helpful signs and staff around to help out if youre unsure of which type ribeye filet or sirloin or weight to get there are also ounce conversions the was plenty for me and i went with the ribeye and yes you should get rare or at worst medium rare anything further is just downright disrespectfulthe food came out pretty quickly about minutes on sizzling plates it was divine the steaks come with corn topping but you can replace with a variety of other veggies or add extras for each i highly recommend the ikinari sauce on your steak it doesnt take away from the flavor but rather enhances it the quality and taste of the meat was so good and an amazing value considering the price do not pass on the garlic rice one of the most delicious side dishes ever mixed with more corn crispy garlic bits of steak and pepper a divine combination the standing while eating concept was a great experience i didnt mind it at all it was fun casual and made people eat a power dinner which must have contributed to the line moving quickly a huge kudos again to the amazing staff who were so attentive even though ikinari is marked as a nontipping establishment i will definitely be back
one of the best pasta establishments i have eaten at this place was packed out when i came here if you expect to eat something else beside pasta this is not the place for you they only serve pasta not only the food taste great the price for the dishes is incredibly cheap i spent less than for a meal and drink i dont think you can ever find a place this cheap in the area will definitely be coming back to this spotif youre looking for a recommendation i got the sausage broccoli rabe i dont remember what kind of pasta i got as these names are all foreign to me im not italian
if i ever swear anything to you all its this if i could give every star ive ever given to just one solitary location there is no doubt in my sugar rushed head that this would be the one i walked in looking line a post apocalyptic scavenger however the owner son employee server messiah to all my yummy dreams greeted me with a fist bump and amped me up to get ready for a one way trip to flavortownhe was helping a couple people ahead of me so i went browsing about the racks and saw several things i wanted to dive right in and start licking but i remarkably abstained from doing so when it became my turn i asked what they had that was vegan and seeing as how it was hot outside i opted for a hot fudge covered ice cream sundae and omg yall seriously its like the best thing in the world like the whole world if ever there were a hidden treasure trove of everything you could ever want it would be packed in this classic style candy and sweets shop the only thing sweeter than whats on the shelves is the owner and staff who apparently fist bump random strangers even when they look homelessi love everything about this place and i know you will too
i came here on a first date and boy was it the best freaking first date evernow while the food was impressive our table happened to be next to the one and only bono himself so that kind of made our night what date hawe shared whiskey shots champagne and wine for almost hours just another thursday night in nycepic night so epicnow to the food its pretty incredible the burger is definitely one of the best ive had considering how simple it really is i had it medium but to be honest the cheese did over empower the burger sometimes nonetheless still love the burger but what do i love more than the burger the shoestring fries i would come here for drunk fries any night if that was an option i could eat a whole side of that by myself and a side of that dijon mustard that they have two sides pleasewe also had a few of their apps deviled eggs are fabulous also had the chicken liver toast and roll mops the toast was definitely a heavier appetizer for me but i really liked it considering i hadnt had that before the roll mops were new to me tooall in all great first visit to spotted pig fabulous food great company amazingly attentive staffcant wait to come back
i arrived to annisa with anita lo my gf only to find that anita lo the chef was not there that night though it was the sous chef katie who would be running the kitchen the concepts are developed by anita lo just like the concept for a dinner date tonight was developed by anita loanita lo was great and the other anita lo was well behaved we ordered the pakora fried oysters which spiciness anita lo informed me could be considered slow anita lo prepared a masterful blend of textures on the plate the focus of the dish was the oyster itself crispy on the outside and so unbelievably soft on the inside it sat upon a cucumber pedestal the pickled fennels also sat on the dish with fennel oil anointed to the side right across the middle of the plate was a brush of yogurt which looked like the carefully crafted stroke of an oil paintingfor the entree anita lo ordered the sea bass by anita lo while i ordered the duck by anita lo hers was perfectly seared sitting atop a piece of broccoli which alluded to asian flavors the other sea bass was part of the fatty belly which rested on a bed of apples a perfect fusion of asian and frenchsimilarly not only was my duck amazing it also came with a small serving of a foie gras and some japanese egg custard that was slightly acidicwe didnt order any dessert but anita los restaurant provided us with some pineapple popsicles candied ginger and a mint chocolateanita los ideas were awesome and anita los concepts were exquisite
so much yes im initially skeptical of places that take another cuisine into the taco realm something usually gets lost in the translation but at taco mahal everything is just amazinghere is what you need to roti tacos are smaller than naan i enjoy both so just gauge how hungry you you can sub normal naan with garlic naan do all the protein options are awesome you cannot go the place is small for winter expect to be cramped in there for spring and summer getting food to go is probably the best option service is awesome the staff are patient and ready to walk you to find the best delicious meal optionsthis is definitely worth checking out it doesnt matter if youre a local grabbing a quick bite in west village or a tourist needed a quick stop taco mahal makes a memorable meal
note that there are two locations of hair lounge make sure you go to the right one overall ambience is cozy hip but chic at the same time most if not all the employees here are chinese the clientele seemed to be mostly asian as well the receptionists are not the most bubbly of people but they get you where you need to go quickly if you have to wait theres plenty of seating in the frontthe hairwashing station was actually comfortable which i cant say for a lot of places it usually hurts my neck like hell but this one was extra comfortable the guy that washed my hair gave me a great scalp massage toothis review is for kelvin hes a lesser known barber here because hes only been there two whole months but he deserves some loving too my thin asian hair can be a struggle sometimes but he cut it to perfection he even told me my last barber gave me an incredibly uneven haircut good thing that person is nowhere near new york city he was friendly offered plenty of suggestions and listened to my concerns with having flat boring hair and offered ways to fix it i wanted my hair quite shorter than it currently was at the time but not too short some places have always cut my hair too short but he understood what i wanted and gave me exactly the length i was thinking of he spent over an hour on my cut and almost minutes on the styling itself thats a lot of love to give to a single customer very much satisfied with my haircut as it is a very flattering length with layers that complement my facehe gave me blow out and the day after i washed my hair and inspected it while straight which is usually how i wear my hair since im so lazy to do anything to it and i must say i love it looks and feels great as reference i cut at least inches off my lengthi also looked around and saw a lot of people with nicely balayagedombred hair i might have to come back to get my hair colored after it fully grows outcut was base with shampoo and a lot of styling overall time spent in salon was about hours will definitely be back

finally ive been working in the area for over years now and ive always said we needed a place like this im so excited burger heights is expanding ive been to their first location further uptown but they are not getting the proper exposure up there this location is walking distance from new york presbyteriancolumbia med center i went during lunchtime and noticed they have a growing clientele there was a line and most tables were occupied they have specialty burgers at decent prices i spent around for a burger and sweet potatoes fries the place resembles shake shack which is not a bad thing they serve wine and beer as well i cant wait to return asap thumbs way up
what else can be said about st pattis that hasnt been said before recently renovated st patricks really is an amazing building nice tall pillars inside beautiful glass windowsafter its renovation it looks brand new something that was way over due for this amazing building which sits in the mist of this busy city because of its location it attracts a lot of tourist of course but both locals tourists can enjoy this beautiful church just like many other places of worship masses are held here on a daily basis along with plenty of special occasion as we have all seem my most recent visit brought me here for mass on ash wednesday lovely service being a new yorker sometimes we can easily forget that we have beautiful places like this in our backyard tend to end up not paying any attention to it local or tourist this amazing church is definitely worth the visit
anyone who lives in the bronx knows its a bitch to get from the east side to the west side of the borough and vice versa no train lines run eastwest and there are few roads that connect as well however i was in the mood for sushi tonight and yelp searching sushi bronx brought aoyu up as the top result it had a high review average and reviews so i decided to make the trek to riverdale and try it aoyu is small and narrow like most other sushi bars ive been to the color scheme is mostly white with splashes of dark woods and black a very clean look which makes the dining room look very open the seats were nice and comfortable even the chopsticks had a finished look to them almost metallic not the normal wooden ones as soon as we were seated a server brought us hot towels to wash our hands a really nice surprise the menu has a selection of rolls ramen and other dishes we started with garlic broccoli basically just steamed broccoli tossed with garlic it was so simple yet so tasty full of flavor for my main i chose two rolls they have a classic roll section of the menu as well as a specialty roll section i went with a king crab california roll from the regular roll selection and the american dream roll from the specialty roll selection ooh the american dream had shrimp tempura and spicy tuna in it covered with a sauce which made it super tasty both rolls were fresh and delicious service was very good everyone was friendly and attentive i was very impressed with aoyu ill definitely be back
if youre in town head up madison avenue to street by foot or taxi in order to experience a nyc icon in the carlyle hotelbemelmans bar hollywood set designers could not have imagined a bar that evokes the mid century classic elegance of nyc better than does bemelmans bar so named because it is decorated with murals by ludwig bemelmans the lighting the intimate size the patina the bartenders and the people watching opportunity all combine to make this a must stop during your visit to manhattanif you stay until the jazz group starts to play expect to pay a cover chargegreat cocktail menu but drinks are pricey cocktails and wine run and up beer and up nuts and chips are generously refilled and of course they make you thirsty so you order another drink
who am i kidding i dont just like this place i love this place yes its that good i love the people they hire i love the decor it is superbly clean there is live music when there isnt live music there is an awesome honorary dj who plays all of the right music maison is where i love to fall in love with myself maison helps me feed my soul signed sealed and delivered they do what they do well is it possible to gush more about it well im working on it seriouslythey price the good malbec at a reasonable point the food is solid the experience is always an amazing time whether sharing in conversation with the bartender or making a maison friend is it possible to not have a good time here
this was my first broadway musical ever setting the bar quite high am i righti acquired tickets through an amex presale back in june and saw the show beginning of february facevalue seats in the back of the orchestra center section ended up being about apiece currently the lowest price you can find on thirdparty sites is about per ticket and thats for the back of the mezzanine seating curse you thirdparty sites and high demand the hamilton show lottery currently releases seats for each max tickets per person but as tens of thousands people enter this lottery the tickets are hard to come by hopefully soon demand goes down and therefore prices will go down too who knows though nonetheless just keep scouring the internet and do what you can to get a ticket at a relatively reasonable price it might be physically and emotionally draining but just save your strength and stay aliverichard rodgers theater perhaps not the best possible venue but the good thing is that there really dont seem to be any terrible seats and the capacity aint half bad as previously mentioned we were seated in the very back of the orchestra center section and we had a pretty great view of the stage on the other hand the seats themselves were a little cramped and the crowds can get a little out of hand preshow and during the intermission nonetheless given how good hamilton is you will more than willingly brave these conditions for this particular showhamilton the musical lives up to the massive hype and is certainly not at all overrated as one orangetoned man may have previously declared i hadnt listened to any of the songs or read any wikipedia articles so as to go into the show with a relatively unadulterated view anyways i was worried that some of the rap dialogue might be hard to follow but it turned out to be fine since all the actors and actresses enunciate exceptionally well and the singing and stage directing was obviously top notch javier mu√±oz brandon victor dixon lexi lawson and mandy gonzalez were all great in their respective roles of hamilton burr and the schuyler sisters and taran killam was super funny as king george after the show i bought the original broadway cast soundtrack and have yet to stop listening to it during the show i for some reason felt super proud being the son of immigrants who worked their tails off to make it in america and the show does a good job not only telling the story of alexander hamilton but honoring those who sacrifice all to be part of the american narrative not only that there are some bomba rap battles air horn soundsanxiously waiting for them to release a live video recording of the show or waiting to see if i can somehow get tickets again if you havent seen it you definitely need to but you didnt need me to tell you that you want to be in the room where it happens

hill dale provides one of the best bar experiences yet you would find this to be one of the most unsuspecting bars in the area i first learned of hill dale at an elite event few years back my second visit was for my birthday party last year i was taking a bit of a gamble on this one a venue i have been only once though i was so glad i did it was perhaps one of the best venues i hosted a birthday no hassle whatsoever and with drinks and food a flowing i can say if they can cater so well to a large party regular service must only equate or exceedi was looking for a classy cocktail bar venue that accomodated at least people throughout a friday evening with a fair priced menu of food and drink not easy to find in the city at all without a large price tag to come along with it with a bit of handy internet research though hill dale proved the best option and suspicious at first hours open bar of beer and wine for person plus an entire room reserved only for us without an extra charge a minimum number of guests was the only main requirement a bright colored wristband was distributed to each of my guests who participated in the bar special so it was easy to spot we sat and stood around a nicely adorned space of exposed brick by a non functioning fireplace conveniently adjacent to the bar so ordering drinks was never an issue the beer menu included craft and was not limited to your typical sam adams or bud lite there was a choice of different wines the food menu was their regular menu of bar fare couches and sofas were in our comfortably cozy area so seating was never an issue a waitress came by several times to ask if we needed food and cleaned our tables throughout the two hours tater tots anyone cant beat a bar that serves tater tots food was delicious aside all things music was great and not an obnoxious playlist of your typical mainstream pop songs not bad at all hill dale not bad at all in fact it was all so much better than i was expectingi was completely astonished by the great service and hospitality provided that friday evening for such a large group of people but not limited to just us the bar was bustling with customers as the night went on but things were running very smoothly for myself and my guests my friends were asking how i found this place a few friends left more than just a little happy for this amazing birthday experience hill dale remains somewhere on top of the list i speak highly of their service for a large birthday party with that in mind i feel strongly that normal service can only go the same way last note beer and wine is an option always but definitely try the cocktails hill dale is built on a reputation of some delicious mixed drinks of quality ingredients all in all i find little to no reason to complain about this place and hopefully all types of occasions will be as wonderful as i had experienced
omakase for pieces of sushi and you need to eat it in min in an outdoor shack like setting somehow none of these seem to go together yet it was a great experience and i was actually full aftercame in on for lunch rsvp the day before around via texting that number we actually arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were seated while another couple finished up there are seats facing the chefs and on the side but i dont think those are for the omakase more for the people waiting for their takeout there was a toasty heat lamp above our seats so if youre in the middle youll be fine my fiance was sitting on the edge so his left arm was a little chilled by the end of our meal the chairs are also covered with thick fuzzy scarves so that kept my butt from freezing on the metal chairs foodsome repeats tuna wagyu and salmon but they were two different types of tuna and one wagyu was combined w uni each piece is made in front of you and the flaming of the tuna and wagyu is so exciting i was slow and had to feed my camera before i ate but the chefs would wait patiently until i finished each piece before placing the next one for my fiance and me they never rushed you and they would tell you what each piece is as it is placed on your plate they also put in a bit of wasabi under each piece of fish everything is so flavorful already so you dont even need the extra soy saucy they offer there is an optional wagyu and uni handroll for a supplement at the end of the meal somehow these two went really well together overall this is a great place for a quick splurge lunch or with a sofriend the experience is and great fish is absolutely worth it

her name is han is a dream come true if youre like me a fan of delicious korean food and a sucker for rusticindustrial decor everything about this place is on point from the unique korean dishes not typically found in other ktown spots to the beautiful plating that is both appetizing and photofriendly i love coming during the daytime the most since the crowd is a lot smaller and their lunch menu offers a wide variety of main and side dishes perfect for those who want to have a little bit of everything did i mention that the lunch options are also extremely affordable i know its tempting to just settle for one of the many korean spots on but her name is han is definitely worth checking out everyone ive recommended to come here has fallen in love with the place as much as i had if you have extra time and extra space in your stomach id highly suggest going to their sister store cup cup next door after your meal to enjoy a nice cup of green tea latte in a cute bear design no lessps i met the owner and asked if her name is han unfortunately its not
dont come here there is nothing to see here i swear just move along collect your pass go i repeat dont come hereif you do i will no longer be able to laugh at all the people who unknowingly pass by little branchs unremarkable entrance while i sip gorgeous delicious cocktails served by gorgeous delicious staff ill have to fight for my sexy table in my dark corner ill need to wait longer than min to imbibe libations that contain nutmeg almond and egg white thats justughdistressing so for the love of me dont come here unless youre with me
this is a fantastic restaurant all around its ultra romantic so a perfect date spot but good for lots of other occasions as well they have a lovely bar and a nice cocktail selection the actual dining area is cozy and beautiful and the atmosphere is amazing for whatever reason the d√©cor makes me feel like this is a perfect fallwinter restaurant probably because they have a big fireplace that makes it feel cozy and rustic inside the service was excellent and the sommelier selected a fantastic bottle of wine for us wish i could remember the name we tried several items off the menu from each category everything was delicious and im pretty sure you cant go wrong with any of it the menu is great and quality of the food is excellent they have some of your standard spanish tapas options but the selection leans more heavily toward a mediterranean influence which was a refreshing change it is somewhat pricey but worth every penny i cant wait to return
wow what a great find this small ice cream shop has an assortment of interesting flavored ice creams that you dont normally encounter my friend and i split the odd pocket which is basically an ice cream sandwich in between a brioche bun it is ridiculously delicious the hot and cold combination of warmed toasted bread with ice cream has me hooked made me wish i had a whole odd pocket to myself props
i love reviews that write themselves dont youabiko turns out some mean japanese curry if you like it hot theyll inevitably ill be asked if abiko is better than go go curry theyre similar but i find abiko tastier to ggc i still love you ill see you next weeklast i was here i sprung for the vegetable curry base price credit accepted and asked for their hottest level of spiciness the waiter talked me down a notch to level three and im thankful they werent kidding their spicy is a damn good one with a burn that sneaks up on you bear hugs you and doesnt let go until you remember your safewordwhen i ran out of rice i had to stop eating i got everything to go and my mouths watering just thinking about the leftoversobviously im no vegetarian to my curry i added the complimentary green onions and garlic flakes then a raw egg then a huge piece of premium then a side of natto when my dish arrived there was miso soup yum and pickled kimchi radish too because koreatowngo to abiko now and say dave sent you i guarantee theyll be confusedthis review is dedicated to jerome t because he reminded me to finish i have no idea if they actually deliver funny because i didnt see a regular sausage offered anywhere
i think ive been on a roll with reviews perhaps i might be too generous in handing out those stars but it was really tough for me to find anything critical at this holeinthewall the eatery is meant best for takeaway service or a quick bite theres very limited seating and not even enough room to stand the kitchenstaff area takes up roughly half the space in what was formerly a chinatown floral shop but i think thats the charm its to recreate in these tiny conditions the comforts of a malaysian coffee shop kopi tiam or a house while giving the customer extensive transparency in seeing how the food is preparedthe food is cheap nothing on the menu goes near the mark a good portion of it is devoted to pastries kuih but there are also minimeals such as nasi lemak coconut rice with anchovies and a boiled egg for or the chilled spicy noodles i have had the pleasure after seeing this place open near me to visit a couple of times after eating nasi lemak at least three times i decided to try the spicy noodlesi enjoyed both a lot the nasi lemak comes with a generous dollop of coconut rice the coconut flavor is not that strong most of the flavor eventually comes from the anchovies and the sambal spicy sauce condiments such as cucumber give a refreshing taste especially after eating the sambal im not malaysian so i might be unorthodox for doing this i usually mix the rice with the sambal and the anchovies counter to my usual ocd ways the spicy noodles are served at room temperature with cucumber and a boiled egg i asked the owner to swap the egg for cucumber the cucumber again gives a cool and refreshing taste and the soup came to surprise one would hardly associate something served room temperature with something spicy it was an interesting combination that i think they pulled off wellat my most recent visit i had the opportunity to learn more about the owner when she gave her story shes very nice and is a very sociable person her parents owned a restaurant in malaysia and she compared the experiences of her owning her own place she described how she imported the bowls were imported from malaysia the owners chatty and relaxed vibe matches what would be expected from a coffee house or someones house a slower pace a break from the hustle and bustle of the city some place to really warm up and talk to someone all while sipping on quality coffee and eating some of the dishes for cheapi find it near impossible to criticize any aspect of the place perhaps one might say that i was too generous with my rating but i stand by with what i said
time for an updateso h bakeshop moved to street and its now named hauscar co although they have moved a few blocks away the recipes are all the same and are basically the best you could find in the area im not joking this place is truly amazing its small but packs a serious punchthe display isnt a mile long which is a good thing because small batches mean everything fresh and never days old you could taste the difference in ingredients that huascar uses in his unique cupcakes theyre different in a good way gianduja guiness cayenne next level cupcake action move over crumbson my last visit i had the mini oreo cheesecake first off they come in mason jars who doesnt like mason jars the cheesecake was just right not too airy but not too heavy it was topped with whipped cream and a layer of chocolate ganache which was tasty i suggest everything herethe new space is bright and clean and you could peek into the kitchen where youll see hauscar baking away he even comes out to chatid highly recommend this place if you craving something sweet
warning to all that love to crunch on nuts i had no idea that almonds are one of the hardest nuts to chew i know now i cant remember the last time i had a cavity i floss and brush after each meal im a fanatic well i still lost a tooth from crunching hard almonds and other nuts for the past few years eating lunch i felt a crack in my molar split that tooth in half down the middle no pain but very uncomfortable to eat you never let a cracked tooth go or bacteria gets in very serious the next day i went to the dentist to see if my tooth could be saved the answer was no their in home oral surgeon was not available for a week and a half knowing how sick ive been recently i asked if they could recommend someone i might be able to see sooner they referred me to doctor tuchman and even made the appointment he saw me the next morning at unheard of typically for me by the time i arrived home from the dentist i had an email confirming my appointment and instructions to complete the patient medical questionaire on line i did so with ease and was amazed at the high tech process excellent i immediately received a conformation from the office the young lady i had spoken to on the phone earlier handled everything for doctor tuchman also included in the email were the detailed instructions pre oral surgery and my options for anesthesia plus steps for post surgery care of the extraction site next morning i arrived at the office very comfortable and clean i didnt even have the opportunity to sit and the young lady i had been communicating with came over introduced herself and handled my introduction to the dental assistant very nice assistant took me to my chair and explained a few things prepping me for surgery in a couple minutes doctor tuchman arrived he took his time explaining in detail all of my options and very patiently answering my questions i naturally selected local anesthetic no ones putting me to sleep at my age i failed to tell him im very susceptible to drugs he over did it with three shots i was numb for seven hours or more i must say either im nerve dead or he is super good at extractions i did not have any pain after the jaw was a little swollen i used ice packs which they provide and they provided gause for bleeding i turned down prescription for pain reliever i get very sick from those i may have taken a couple tylenol as i said i never had any pain the following day doctor tuchman called and we also emailed back and forth with any questions or concerns i had the extraction was on a wednesday on friday he contacted me by phone one last time to see how i was doing he reassured me i could email if needed him over the weekend or the following week i received wonderful caring treatment throughout the whole process i would highly recommend doctor tuchman i know if im still living in manhattan and need oral surgery i will go to doctor tuchman since i dont have dental insurance it set me back a couple months of my monthly budget allowance manhattan prices are a killer if you want the best care bring a fat wallet or excellent creditjust remember avoid hard nuts when i did some research on line theres been a recent epidemic of broken and split teeth from almonds dont let this happen to you
i have to say i was fairly impressed with this place and will give it a stars rating after reading all the yelp reviews i decided to come here best to make reservations i made a reservation for for since the popular times were all taken up especially counter seats of course this is omakase style sushi which is what i was looking for there were options i believe think it was a or piece sushi sashimi we opted for the piece sashimi omakase pp they give you a couple of appetizers which were all pretty good there was a soup and ice cream mochi for dessert in this set the sashimi that came with this course were really good fish was fresh of course wouldnt have expected anything less if im paying pp i thought the sashimi was very little for the price i think the piece sushi with no sashimi was so for an extra i only had like pieces of fish different kinds tuna clam and red snapper nonetheless it was really good no regrets the red snapper was my favorite of them all although i dont remember a lot of the fishes i tried i really enjoyed the hokkaido uni compared with the santa barbara uni he was nice enough to let me try the hokkaido onewow probably the best uni ive ever had to be honest i really enjoyed this place because they gave such a huge variety of different fish selections so i never got bored ive been to some omakase places in ny where they do not give as many different selections they will use the same types of fishes and just serve it a different way this restaurant is very small very intimate i also liked that they had a small cup with a wet towel for people who wanted to eat the sushi with their hands instead of chopsticks that was something small but new to me the fish was so good and fresh that eating it with soy sauce would be completely wrong you just put each whole piece in your mouth as is no soy sauce not like the american way of eating sushi dont come here expecting dragon rolls or california rolls this is the real sushisashimi stuff if you want dragons rolls and all that stick to your japanese restaurants owned by chinese people lol great experience here i would def come back some day expensive but great quality fish
this has been on my wishlist for over a year we were overlyambitious that night as we had had a few drinks and appetizers somewhere else before wandering in to o ya out of the cold o ya definitely deserves to be the star of the night so we wont make that mistake again it was a wednesday night and we had a reservation for around the staff welcomed us kindly though we were a bit late the ambience was lovely the lightning warm the decor charming the tiny chopsticks rests were adorable some were in the shapes of cute animals and we loved the whale and kitty ones the server humorously mentioned that they used to have pandashaped ones but they disappeared to new homes haha though the omakase was tempting as always im glad we kept it to a few a la carte choices the presentation was stellar and everything tasted heavenly lots of delicious truffle choices we had some lovely champagne to start because you know bubbly goes with everything in life the bluefin chutoro with the herb sauce was one of the stars as was the scallop truffle i do believe the truffle scented uni nigiri was possible the best uni ive ever put in my mouth ever i mean im not saying ive had a lot of uni but still really everything just melted in our mouths felt like heaven really i kept wondering if i really was still alive i might have pinched myself once or twice for one of the only times in my life ever i would have skipped the dessert though the mochi donuts were interesting its just that everything else was too good its perhaps too extravagant to wish to come back for the but its christmas and a girl can dream
since their soft opening few weeks ago we have been going to this lovely caf√© almost every weekend instead of having so many updates i decided to combine the last several visits into one it has constantly being really busy with its fun theme good food and coffee the only time it was not full was the day of snow storm when most businesses and schools were closed for the day due to the severe weather rue la rue caf√© was open thank you for being a dedicated caf√©we have been there for several saturdays now and it is constantly busy also they have had musicians there on every saturdays so far which is really cool they always have a pianist and one accompanying string musician like a cellist or a guitarist nice to have a live music while you are enjoying a brunchthey have some glasses with golden girls design in gold of course i believe for sale i dont think they serve their coffee or any drinks in it since i havent seen it used inside the caf√© for customers it would be fun yes but it probably is more cost effective to not use fancy glasses like that as the design can fade faster in a commercial grade powerful dish washerso over the last several visits we had adult mac cheese betty white cake blanches raspberry cheesecake chocolate cheesecake mrs naugatucks curry chicken sandwich sophias amaretto cheesecake strawberry cheesecake tomato mishmash in a bread bowl and a waffle with strawberry butter jealous i know i would be toowe have not come across anything that we didnt like everything was tasty and i can see that they are all crafted with care this also means that food does not come out right away but i prefer them to make the food to order and with love i saw a customer who was so impatient and kind of rude because they ordered a hot dish and it didnt come out within few minutes if it came out so fast that meant it was already made and sitting there for a while here the food might take a bit longer youd like but you are getting something that is made for you and only you so please come with a little more patiencethe staffs here are nice not all friendly but most of them are very nice and attentive one of the staffs took a really good care of the demanding customers i mentioned above with great patience and poise the owner micheal is there all the time greeting customers with smile making everything feels special thank you for being a friendone last note they have extended their hours to to so now you can visit them in the evenings if you cant make it during the day time
doughnuts are at the top of the list of items i would blissfully stuff my face with if things like health and money were of no concern one of my most cherished childhood memories is journeying out to long island to my family friends dunkin donuts and devouring a jelly glazed doughnut with a sweet milk doughnut plant is dunkin donuts on crack softer fluffier with less of the sugary sweet aftertaste i still felt like i needed a kale salad and a green juice after eating but it was one of the few muchhyped instagrammed food that is absolutely worth it my office ordered a few boxes of donuts for a holiday party and i unabashedly stuck a few in my bag to take home for my boyfriend to try they were just that unbelievably good still moist even after sitting in my bag too the standouts were the peanut butter and banana combo why isnt this a more common combination and the christmas tree donut mint and chocolate there was some other chocolate flavor but the only one i returned for seconds and thirds for was the pb and banana must come back for the creme br√ªl√©e donut after all if its good enough for hillary clinton to be bad about its good enough for me
one of the nicest meals in nolita fully digitized you can order your food at a kiosk use your credit card and get your order picked up at the counter lots of counter and bench space to eat your meal its a simple interior but the large windows provide lots of great natural light to come in my go to favorites here are the shrimp hai gow large shrimp very flavorful and fresh the fried rice which had ample ingredients and vegetables was very satisfying the shrimp dumplings with snow peas was also delicious what really stayed in my mind over time that i can go back to get everytime is the steamed ribs with char siu glaze tender porky and full of chinese bbq flavor very satisfying ill definitely be back for sure
quality creative subs with inventive bold flavors staff was extremely helpful and remembered my name the whole time i was there i went with the roasted chicken sammy with date and apple slaw the ciabatta had a great crunch and was a huge fan of the slaw cant think of a better sub shop experience to date ill be back forsure
its very hard not to like a place where the first thing that greets you when you enter is a fresh wall of apples and a lovely person wanting to help you with your coat i have wanted to come to bouley for many many years finally i very luckily got to come here recently not once but twice for lunch the whole restaurant is just simply stunning from the entrance and wall of apples it smells so amazing btw lush waiting area to the upstairs dining and also private dining room downstairs the visual experience is already very stimulating all before you have even received your first course the first time i lunched here we were seated in the downstairs private room it was like being taken to a european library very charming and quaint and my second time here we were seated in the upstairs main dining room both are beautiful in their own ways and you will not be disappointed in either dining areas the whole restaurant has accents and furniture imported from a french monastery while you await your order to arrive they have a wonderful bread cart i dont even like bread but i tried a few different fresh breads my favorite has black currant in it i started with the porcini flan made with golden princess and alaskan dungeness crab black truffle dashihad it was filing and also very tasty for my main entree i ordered the organic duck which had organic maine einkorn grain and young sproutswith new york state foie gras braised in red burgundy duck which i highly recommend to finish up the meal with dessert i recommend the chocolate cake it delightfully oozes with fudge or avocat ananas which is pineapplewasabi sorbet fresh avocado miso sponge cake sesame tuile for a light martini if you enjoy apples i mean they have a lot of apples here i loved la pomme overall both meals here were excellent as was the impeccable service as expected both meals were delightful and it only makes me sad that they are set to shutter in early ps for the ladies dont forget your gift with the hostess at the end of the meal the delicious lemon pound cake is a great way to enjoy a little bit of bouley at home michelin
i was super impressed with eatsa i was excited to try it but since its their first few days open in this location i had expected there might be a few issues but there werent so the basic concept is that you go in and order from an ipad or you can order from their app and once its ready you go pick it up from a little cubby its also relatively healthy with all the bowls being either quinoa or salad based and there doesnt appear to be any meat on the menu fyi and pretty inexpensive i had downloaded the app and previewed the menu and options but i actually wanted to go in and see what it was like the only human interaction with people working there was them guiding you to the ipad and asking you to move over while you wait you dont even really need any help since its so simple you can choose a bowl and then customize it to your liking or just customize a bowl from scratch i went with the smoke house salad and was able to take out the things i didnt want and add in the things i did super easy and i really dont even think i had to wait minutes for it to be ready there was a small crowd of people nothing really too crazy but all the food seemed to come out really fast there was a small area high counter for eating but i took it back to my office to eat everything in it seemed really fresh and it was so good im happy this opened down the block from my office hopefully it wont get too crazy when more people discover it but ill definitely be back
craftbar was always a winner in our experience a casual but refined relaxing atmosphere just below madison square park with dark walls bar dining and booths which became the mantra of many of the hipster joints one sees in brooklyn these days reliable though elevated with comfort food menu items ie buttermilk fried chicken louisiana shrimp and gritsveal ricotta meatballs short ribs etcsadly due to a rent increase raising it to per month craftbar will be closing its doors april we look forward to visiting tom colicchios latest restaurant in the beekman hotel further downtown in the financial district named fowler wells hopefully the rent will not be as astronomical
it was serendipitous that we stumbled upon this very good coffee shop in the bowery while looking for a quick coffee the space is small with limited seating maybe just a few counter perches and only a few stools there is also a bench outsidecute scruffy hipster baristas with black blocky glasses dyed blue hair and throw on out of bed wardrobes blast out deep rich joe we had black thick creamy americanos for each and found them to be of european quality the wall space is bare zen like and the crowds are large its true simple good coffee like gasolinepsits kinda hidden in an alleydrink and go no food that i saw but you never know we were super content with our outta space black cups
one of the few places i ever expected to find myself at was le bernardin why well as a child growing up i abhorred seafood and fish of any kind it was partially derived from being exposed to a limited number of dishes but mostly due to my stubborn nature but i digress but for those looking to truly find some of the best seafood in new york city le bernardin should be at the top of the list the accolades are numerous including a consistent string of michelin stars four nyt stars and a nearperfect zagat score and chef eric ripert is considered by many to be one of the best chefs of his time his philosophy is printed clearly on each of the menus at the restaurant the fish is the star of the platethe dining options at le bernardin are also quite generous with options available for lunch and dinner and allow diners to choose between a number of prix fixe menus and a la carte dishes while its certainly possible to have a fairly extravagant meal we opted to come in the middle of the day for a slightly more scaled back but nonetheless comprehensive experience reservations were made a month in advance as well although the availability of tables during lunch seem to be better than at dinner regardless tits best to come prepared as its far from just a casual dining experiencethe meal will start diners off with a choice of bread from their bread tray as well as an amuse bouche we were treated to a generous salmon rillette paired with the buttery thin toast points from the three course prix fixe i opted for the seafood truffle pasta and was presented with one of most beautiful and fragrant pasta dishes i have yet to find the tagliatelle pasta was cooked to just the right texture and bite but played second fiddle to the tender pieces of crab lobster and scallop that highlighted the dish all the components were lightly coated in a black truffle emulsion that imparted a distinct flavor in the sauce but held back from overpowering the entire dish for those looking for something a little lighter and brighter the langoustine and sea urchin was a similarly gorgeous dish featuring a thin langoustine carpaccio studded with generous servings of sea urchin all balanced out with a sweet and tart noriapple vinaigretteoriginally for my main i had decided on the pan roasted cod which was served with a coq au vin sauce upon my first bite into the dish however i was taken aback at the acidity in the sauce which wasnt balanced out by anything else in the dish our server upon noting my hesitation at the dish immediately inquired if everything was all right and i told him that i found the sauce too sharp for my tastes he immediately had the dish sent back to the kitchen informing me that the red wine in the coq au vin sauce could be sometimes overwhelming and offered a suggestion for an alternative the black bass surf and turf the latter option was im happy to say one of the best seafood dishes ive yet to have which paired a perfectly cooked filet of black bass with braised veal cheek the dish was dotted with several portions of a creamy light parsnip emulsion and an aromatic broth that featured ginger and a five spice reduction i can still recall how perfectly crisp and thin the skin on the bass was how tender the veal was to cut into and how beautifully the parsnip paired with the lightly spiced broth while i cant speak to the entire menu at le bernardin its impossible to go wrong with this dish and its one im glad i did wind up withas for dessert i ended up going with the black walnut a beautifully plated dish that featured a cylinder of baba au scotch cake traditionally cooked with rum but traditions are meant to be broken caramelized banana and a quennelle of black walnut ice cream it was surprisingly balanced with the darker nuttier flavors contrasting well with the coolness and lightness of the ice cream i think my preference may lie with the slowroasted pear however which took a perfectly poached pear and uniquely elevated it with a beurre noisette tuile and a frozen pear parfait it was a truly refreshing perfectly sweet dessert that featured the pear in numerous forms and texturesi dont think i need to touch too much on the elegance and refinement of the dining room and the professionalism and attentiveness of the service at le bernardin in actuality this review is probably more redundant than anything else but if there is one takeaway from it let it be this go there is good reason that le bernardin stands the test of time and continues to be seen by many as one of the best restaurants in the city if not the world it is a fitting review at least in my opinion and i can only hope to return one day to experience the full dinner rest assured that since moving to nyc this has been nearly completely rectified
im so glad this place is herecorvo has been open for about a month now and in that time theyve had a promotion where every item on their menu is every single item that includes all their coffee products as well as their pastries breakfast sandwiches and other goodies i keep going every day thinking the promotion will end soon but its been a solid month and prices are still the same so not only are the prices great but get this the coffee is too they use la colombe beans and turn out solid lattes regular coffee flat whites or anything youre in the mood for best of all the service is friendly and efficient i occasionally ask for mochas or flavored lattes with very little syrup and they have always been happy to accommodate ive never been disappointed with either my drink or the service part of me hopes that corvo will stay a secret but part of me is happy to see more people discover it
if wine enthusiasts ask bordeaux or burgundy pho enthusiasts similarly ask northern or southern style my answer to the latter is always northern pho bac hanoi house is the only nyc representative so far that makes pho bac i must mention that this review is a long but personally special one to me because i am finally writing a review about pho as a vietnamese to create a certain credibility of this review i need to mention my background i am not the vietnamese who grew up with orange countys cuisine but the vietnamese who spent the entire childhood in vietnam where i often had pho bac northernstylepho made by people from the north basically what i am trying to say is i know what im talking about back to the opening question northern or southern why is it so crucial for this review it is because the majority or may i dare saying all of pho in nyc is the southernstylepho the kind of pho videos you see on youtube by zagat munchies even asians like fung bros are videos about southernstylepho the only popular videodocumented northernstylepho appeared on anthony bourdains show there is nothing wrong about your choice of style but if i liked bordeaux and you served only burgundy theres a less chance that id come back righthere are some main differences northern pho bac traditional noodles flat soft soup clear cooked from cow bones taste mildly sweet bland a hint of black pepper and ginger meat chicken or fat beef to compromise with the soup addition to serving chinese cruller pickled garlic portion medium bowl lots of scallions location local northern vietnam southern pho nam noodles chewy soup cloudy cooked from cow chicken bones and sometimes dried seafood taste sweet rich meat doesnt matter lean or fat the dish is highly fat anyway addition to serving sriracha hoisin side veggies portion humongous bowl sprinkled scallions location anywhere in the world but local northern vietnamhanoi houses pho is not perfectly authentically northern hanoi the most distinctive difference of the styles is the noodles the noodles hanoi house use are absolutely not northern but considering the northern noodles are handmade and no restaurant wants to pioneer i probably shouldnt demand the soup on the other hand is the real deal a very important point to mention here is their price points some people really really need to complain about spending for a pho my total combo of a pho bone marrow chinese cruller tip were if you can pay for a ramen or a pasta whats so wrong about a pho preached about your health then demanded less than for an msg meal only idiots would expect a dinner in a neat topservice restaurant in east village
this review is primarily for the galette des rois yes every year around january french people enjoy the galette des rois tradition even after january many bakeries keep the cakes often even until the end of january when valentines stuff starts coming in so go out and get some galettei personally always find it a bit annoying when people say stuff like this italian place is legit because my moms italian and the pasta sauce is the same etc well sorry im from france and i highly recommend this place does this mean somehow that my opinion trumps those of other just regular americans even if theyve personally eaten like bazillion croissants more than me well duh yes im better than you haha no just joking but yes french people can be snobbythis is the best galette ive eaten in a long time crunchy and flaky and buttery and light on the outside as it should its puff pastry similar to a croissant and warm rich gooey almondy on the inside typical frangipane same often found in almond croissants plus the top design is really nice and the price at person size for person size is spot on kayser only had a person size and it was really didnt like the last cakes i bought at kayser so was very delighted with millefeuille this timedont be shy enjoy the tradition with us they even sell individual slices its basically a giant pie shaped almond croissant so good oh if you dont know the tradition involves sharing the pie with friends and the person who finds the f√®ve bean usually a figurine gets the crown and is the king or queen and if you lose well just keep buying more galettes until you win the crown like i do lolto finish off ive tried other galettes at kayser pain quotidien financier and this is my favorite financier is good but basic millefeuille really kicks it up a notchas for their other offerings they are also very good they have croissants they even offer private classes super pricey if you ask me their namesake millefeuille and other standard cakes and viennoiseries oh and yes they have cups so make sure you get the cups app to get cheaper coffeei really like millefeuille so i definitely wont hesitate next time say to buy a b√ªche de noel from here yes another french tradition that americans really ought to experience and one you guys just missed btw dont buy from kayser overpriced and mediocre b√ªches i have really really enjoyed other b√ªches though from dominique ansel and restaurant benoit they do special orders ceci cela normally is another favorite but their b√ªches normally dont look very nice
guys super foodtown is the best thing to happen to the neighborhood in quite some time finally a grocery store with a big selection of fresh produce and a meat section where the meat isnt halfspoiled and all dripping meat juices on itself looking at you key foods and the prices dont make you want to straight up punch someone looking at you gristedes they even have some bougie staples like stations for you to grind your own peanut butter and coffee and a sprawling selection of cheeses after youve stuffed yourself with cheese and peanut butter you might be looking to shave some calories and boom a wall full of halo top ice cream you start feeling bad for eating the semifranken food that is halo top and lo and behold another wall full of nourishing bobs red mill products you decide you dont actually feel that bad about eating frankenfood and heyo aisles of fun snack foods have you ever tried coconut jerky i hadnt either before discovering it at this wonderful gem of a grocery store my point is you can find everything you need and also everything you dont need but will thoroughly enjoy right here on st the service is great and the manager who i swear is always working has a frankly admirable amount of hustle in his heart your groceries will be bagged in no time flatthe best news of all free delivery in a country run by a despotic monster in the midst of the cold and dreary winter let food town be the salve your weary soul craves
this is it this is my favorite coffee place in the world its a bougie slightly hipster place but if you want an incredible unique coffee experience go to coffee project new yorkhere is what you need to the happy drink is everything i actually feel happier after i order it its delicious creamy refreshing and the coffee is well done you have to get it no matter what the weather this is the drink to the deconstructed latte is worth a try at least once so much thought is put into it and the flavor profiles are really service is top notch everyone is friendly and coffee this is more of a sit down and enjoy your coffee and the vibes place but you can take coffee to the coffee is absolutely worth the higher price tagcpnw is the number one spot for coffee whether youre visiting nyc or a local you absolutely must come here and you will come back
this israeli bakery has many yummy carbs that will have you coming back for more from breads to cakes to cookies to tarts theres no telling where to start and end with your purchasesthey also have multiple sitting areas where you can sit and chatt it up at the back of the store is an area where you can order drinks hot or cold they also have multiple pastries you can choose from as you order your drinkthe staff is all so friendly and interestingly enough they say they work out to avoid putting on weight from working there i couldnt agree more
i have taken quite a few classes at this studio for like years i havent been consistent so unfortunately i cant grace a stage anytime soon but i thought of reporting my experience herethis school is super organized you can tell that theyve been doing this for a while their classes are posted online they offer amazing specials via groupon livingsocial and other sites they even have an unlimited class monthly specialtheir teachers are amazing i love jose for the beginner salsa classes because he breaks things down and hes super funny i prefer joe for the advanced ones because he teaches with speed and efficiency which is what intermediates and advancers need we dont have time to review the basics so thanks for skipping it i firmly believe that this school can teach anyone with the worst case of left feet best of all they offer a ton of classes from bachata to zumba so that unlimited class special can replace any gym membership if youre a class aficionado like me
from the moment you walk in the golden decorations of the restaurant is absolutely breathtaking and their food completely reflects the beauty of decor for a party of that made no reservations we waited about which is good for a friday night at as for their beverages i highly recommend their jasmine tea one pot gives your about cups of tea because it offers a refreshing taste when paired with your appetizer or entree for the appetizer we got both their papaya salad and mieng kum their mieng kum shrimp leafwrapped bitesize was a fun way to start the meal with your friends where they give you bite sized portions served on top of shot glasses not only is the dish visually appealing but the bite sized portions offer a great burst of authentic thai flavors such as ginger fresh red onions shrimp and coconut for the entree i hands down recommend their ped ron crispy five spice duck upon receiving the dish you could immediately tell how delicious and expertly plated the dish was the duck was cooked to perfection with the tender duck simply falling apart in your mouth upon biting it the dish is paired with a sweet honeysoy dressing which i found to be pleasant but not necessary to enjoy the taste of the duck overall the beauty of the restaurant and dishes alone should be enough to draw you in for a meal i would highly recommend thai villa for a special event or an intimate date night
jane of viewbeau eyelashes is really really a gem i have been seeing her for years and have been following her around throughout each location she has been to it seems like this one might be more permanent and it is very convenient right on and park in the middle of everything she and her colleague work hard do a perfect job and are so accommodating as they are happy to text to make appointments and are so flexible on timings before i came to jane i saw the bigger places in ktown like ebenezar and i just feel like the work doesnt compare jane is meticulous detailedoriented and she is very personable whenever i have her lashes with good care they last as long as weeks she has all different lengths curl types thinthick and will advise you on whats best for you she is skilled at mixing different types of lashes and the lashes never hurt or feel tight she will personalize whatever look you want she is really so sweet and her demeanor is so relaxing that i always somehow fall asleep definitely go to viewbeau they have loyal cards to and trust me you wont regret it typically i do lashes per eye but she can also put on more for special occasions attaching a photo of the incredible lashes she did on my wedding day my natural lashes are thin and go down these make a huge difference
this place is amazing come here to sweat out toxins detox burn calories utilize light therapy and just zone out i feel so much better after an hour session albeit i last maybe minutes in there but it makes a difference the first time i went i think it took some getting used to but the more i have gone the longer i can last and i absolutely notice a difference i get a glow that i normally only get from a good facial i sweat out toxins and it definitely relieves muscle and joint pain highly recommend coming here also if you come while the alchemist kitchen is open grab something to drink after

this review is solely on their happy hour pm pm which is freaking fantastic for strong vodkas with a variety of flavors to choose from i forget what the price of wells was but drafts as wellfood options are available as well but as im ignorant to the fare i declined ordering anything the bartender is super friendly there wasnt any entertainment when i went in at pm but i enjoyed catching up with a friend so i didnt mind the quiet as we were leaving around the place was definitely starting to get full so the earlier the better my happy hour peepsif i get drunk on in midtown you get stars
one of the relatively new dessert places thats unique which is tough to say in chinatown this one is worth your time as many know taiyaki is a cake shaped into a fish served up with soft serve to make it fun they pair it with trendy new ice cream flavors that youre familiar with some filling custardred bean and toppings they all come together in a half piping hot and ice cold artwork that holds up which is perfect for photos not only are they photogenic they taste great too since their grand opening earlier this year ive already had the green tea vanilla and most recently pumpkin spice they all taste pretty damn good which is a testament as to why they have continuous lines straight out through now winter the store is perfectly located with steps of canal st despite being on baxter as a street service is exceptional accommodating and upbeat and ive never had a single issue every time ive ordered theyre the ones to watch as theyre best situated to come out with new colorful and tasty combinations in the winter soon thats sure to turn heads
i do a taco cleanse about once a week sometimes you have to reboot and get illusions of how fantastic life will be when youre years old right out of your systemto me al pastor makes the most sense ap wakes up my immune system and reminds it to keep running or elseevery few weeks i like to switch it up a carnitas burrito and margarita cleanse do wonders for your face like making it look more trustworthy and other such traits i discovered the carnitas benedict recently and let me tell ya it left my taste buds more balanced and focusedone side benefit of going burrito between taco cleanses is that it elevates my mood with these simple crispy sweet potato fries maybe its the cojito or lime im not exactly sure tbhall of us are exposed to some environmental toxins the bottomless brunch happy hour lime margaritas can keep those toxins company and maybe fight them celltocell depending on your bodythe effects of cascabels churros are impressive it relieves inflammation of the soul and the dark chocolate dip facilitates this process nicelyfinally ive found several taco cleanse enthusiasts here of different ages and species and its a neat community dogs chill out on the patio lots of kids learn their common core math and tipping etiquette on receipts here there was one eight yearold kid who just ordered a plate of meat and sweet potato fries because he was getting in shape to shoot a commercial he looked like a young rocky so this stuff obviously works it was last time i was here there were fans but no airconditioner and a server brought over a bunch of ice to play withdef recommendhappy hour tips skip wings get veggie tamale house margarita strong
five senses is my new favorite restaurant in koreatown hands down the line is extremely intimidating as its usually out the door every night but dont worry they move quick here i would not recommend coming here in groups of more than its an optimal if you have a party of and they can seat you quicker our wait for on a saturday evening was around minutes which is amazingthe atmosphere reminds me of a restaurant in chinatown or something they want you out as fast as possible to serve other people so service is a little rushed and frantic i wouldnt come here expecting too much out of service but they still get the job done i dont mind that just means i get seated faster overall service is acceptable but could be better the restaurant is loud and bustling but not so much to the point where you feel the need to scream over the table to talk the music is which is interesting for a restaurant on this streetive eaten here a couple times now and each time the food has been amazing i love me some soups and stews and five senses has a ton to choose from their seolleongtang ox bone broth mul naengmyeon cold noodles in broth and yukgaejang spicy beef stew were all very flavorful and some of the best ive had especially the cold noodles they are a little pricier than their competitors but i guess you pay for the quality and the servings are pretty large i have also had the spicy double fried chicken and its comparable if not better than your usual kyochon or bonchon the outside is very very crispy and it packs a lot more heat than it lookscome for the food ignore the dodgy service i gave them the benefit of the doubt and keep returning because this stuffs the real deal
service got a little antsy near the end of our dinner but there was still an hr before they closed dont rush me when im eating i but otherwise everything else about service was excellentfoodquail eggs blue crab shrimp dumpling have done without was very blah yellow fin spicy tuna tartare was so good best thing we ordered my dining companion usually is skeptical about tartare or anything thats not cooked hes very uncultured but he too could not deny this masterpiece of food pan seared duck breast green curry cooked i almost gobbled up the whole thingpad thai jumbo tiger prawn
i was reading an article about colbert becoming the new host of the late show and they mentioned interviewing jon stewart while he was at chalk point kitchen drinking a red stripe so obviously we had to go and check it out stalk for ourselves we didnt find jon stewart there but we did find ourselves a great new restaurantill quickly cover the nonfood items first to get that stuff out of the way i was a fan of the overall aesthetic of the restaurant even if it might be a bit too urban farmhouse kitschy for some service was exceptional as judged by the ice water never less than half full test i also got some excellent recommendations from our waiter which ill cover nowmarket heirloom tomatoes lionis old fashioned ricotta as described this isnt anything fancy but it certainly was a very good representation of the farmtotable concept being sold by the restaurant sometimes just fresh highquality ingredients speak for themselvesmaine uni crudo uni is the new bacon apparently if you see an item on the menu with uni you just order it icelandic arctic char awesome this was my entree the fish was prepared perfectly tender with the white miso sauce balanced nicely against the radishes and grapefruit i normally like to explore the menu a bit when i revisit a place but im fairly certain ill just order this again the next time im herenew york state grassfed lamb loin chops my very pregnant wife had this and cleaned her plate as well i had a couple of bites and the lamb seemed quite tasty with none of the gamey taste you sometimes get with lamb butterscotch pudding scotchy scotch scotch yumoverall i was impressed not only with the great food but also with the fact that they didnt seem to have any of the usual struggles a new restaurant has during their first few weeks it probably helped that we were one of the first diners there when they opened at but well definitely be back again
one of the best weekday midtown lunches ive ever had bar none db was not on my list or anything but yelp had a hand in leading me here when a work buddy and i got the hankering for korean we naturally made a beeline to ktown none of the joints on west were calling out to us we whipped out our magic devices and voila dons was only another blocks walkdb is a classy joint with an upmarket decor perfect for business lunch the restaurant is spacious and larger than the storefront would suggest we were led to the back area which was a tad more casual the seating is interesting they have these tatamilike seats with cushions that kind of look subterranean with your lower limbs disappearing into the floor actually its quite a snug fit in thereas in other korean eateries service was brisk we got the banchan as soon as we ordered munching on wonderful nibbles like sauteed spinach several pickled veggies and even dry fish flakes at least thats what i think it was the lunch specials are excellent ranging from with a choice of stew more of a soup i opted for the don special pork belly with stew and rice accompanied by haemulsundubu spicy seafood and tofu broth we ordered a couple of cass lagers friday afternoon and had a leisurely lunch i came away very happy dons is good eating and stands out from an already very good pack of ktown restaurants

its been sometime since ive been to a lounge with a dj that really djs ive been to many in the past but the dj at bob doesnt try squeezing in portions of songs within minutes dj mika though seemingly a bit shy throws a punch with her playlist i did a teeny bit of djing and hung out with djs back in the day so i know how i like it done she mixed things up and included some noncommercial radio hardcore hiphop from back in the day it was a breath of fresh air not hearing the same ol commercial hip hop standards and i have a feeling if she could she would go deeper into her list of hardcore hits as most have mentioned bob is small but wasnt too small for us we took advantage of the space early before the masses headed in and the ac was pumping providing ample ventilation bathrooms are cute as cute goes setup has the one sink placed on the outside of the toilet areas more as a necessity as space is limited bartending and busser service was great for us but certain as the evening progresses things no doubt will get less ventilated with less room to dance and slower service but no matter this is a great spot with a very diverse crowd to dance and dance and dance miss evelin and i finally made it here and we will be back all are welcome to join if schedules allow i know my dancing feet are quite happy and will be shuffling my way back to bob bar happy hour from cover after
i need to quit coming here every week but damn its so hard its an actual restaurant with sitting areas its almost never crowded and you definitely get more options than at the cart vendor plus you can take your meal over to central park and have an impromptu picnici always get myself small gyro platter with extra meat no rice trying to be low carb about things and loads of white sauce i am always surprised at how generous and filling the portion is they dont really have the sauce bottles out there for abuse but they really do put on the right amount of sauces unless youre the type of guy to gorge down a whole bottle of sauce then this isnt the place for you they do offer packets of hot sauce for an extra fee but good lord those are so hot at least theres also a soda fountain to quench the heat sometimes the pay line gets backed up because some patrons either order a large amount or pay in pennies or something most times its a fairly quiet in and out sort of thing either way beats the long cart line any day

where to start for one stars so you really dont even need to read this review anymore but go go gothe cast is amazing and embodied gloria estefan and emilio estefan amazingly well she literally looked just like young gloria estefan the plot was a little bit of everything love music happiness tears laughter emotionsthe theatre itself is nice clean and well kept the seats are incredibly close together and if anyone leaves their seat everyone they pass have to stand so only little downside but otherwise great no food is served just drinks in cute take home souvenir sippy cups hahathe cast is interactive and upbeat a great energy and a great show for a date or girls night i wouldnt recommend it for kids because the costumes are everyday costumes not much pizazz so might be tough to keep a kid still through it but otherwise go go go amazing show
having lived in nyc for over years now theres been a noticeable good dim sum drought so much so that as a cantonese person i would wait for trips back home to california vancouver or hong kong to fulfill my cravings tim ho wan the well known michelin starred dim sum chain from hong kong was my renewed hope to change thattoday december is the soft opening which will last with staggered hours until its grand opening date of january i arrived a little after and was unfortunately told min later that the the couple in front of me would be the last people that would be seated for lunch i was devastated but the couple in front of me graciously offered to give me their spot in line because they had to go back to work this was a recurring theme considering i didnt get seated until around so plan accordingly they do have a namecell phone service when you check in that will text you when a table is closer to opening up it seemed to be having issues today but when things calm down this would be a great help so you dont have to wait around the entire time and can do some shopping or get a drink nearbythe space isnt the biggest but it feels bright and comfortable i believe it only seats with tables and booths optimized for so no huge round tables here for you and your extended family ive been to one of the tim ho wan locations in hong kong several times and it was also on the smaller sidedespite the craziness of opening day the staff remained friendly and calm front of staff june and christina were great along with our server whose name i didnt get but looked like a young ming tsai more surprisingly was how calm the kitchen staff was viewable through an open kitchen concept they were focused like a welloiled machine and food came out consistently without large waits i loved the beautiful marble lazy susan that the kitchen staff and wait staff use to exchange food we did wait a bit for one dish but i think that was due to it not being put in which has always happened in general at dim sum places with the checklisttallying order methodlike any dim sum place you come for whats good and unique to that specific place the highlight and namesake was of course their baked bbq pork buns they came out hot and fresh out of the oven and were made more delicious because we were so cold and hungry from waiting outside and it was the first thing that arrived at our table the topping was crisp and lightly sweet and the inside was perfectly seasoned being both sweet and savory like a good char siu i also noticed some umami seaweed dashi flavor at one point from what i remember i think the buns here were even better than the ones i had at tim ho wans hk locationother highlights were the shrimp dumplings har gow and the shrimp and chives in rice roll har cherng the shrimp were really fresh sweet and plump again these were served super warm and fresh i generally prefer the shrimp rice rolls to the pork ones and this was the case here as well since the bbq pork rice rolls were a bit forgettable and the pork pieces were cut in large chunks that felt out of place in the dish also if you have an aversion to cilantro dont order the bbq pork rice rolls its common for the meat rice rolls at dim sum places to have cilantro and it exists here as wellfried turnip cakes these were good too not the best ive had but decently seared and the ratio of daikon to flour was good and not overly doughy or plasticy at alldeep fried dumplings with pork and shrimp these have always been a favorite of mine i generally describe these as meat mochi footballs these dont reheat well so id recommend eating them here instead of taking them homevegetable spring rolls really good with lots of mushroom flavor only downside was these were on the oily side could fry these better or let the oil soak out a bit moreanother unique thing here was the french toast with custard it tastes like a fried souffle sandwich filled with custardi was really impressed overall especially given that it was the first day of its soft opening i could feel how much work was put into the desire for this place to be successful from the food to the service i went into this experience just hoping to have a solid dim sum place finally in nyc but somehow i left feeling happier than i expected i wasnt expecting to have a sense of camaraderie in line with fellow diners or that i would feel a sense of warmth from all of the staff especially with how crazy busy today was you know what i mean when youre accustomed to chinese or dim sum restaurants where attitude and annoyance is the norm but it reminded me that the essence of dim sum really is a place to rest gather with loved ones and warm your heart and belly
delicious food with impeccable servicethe restaurant is a notip restaurant however the service is better than most of the restaurants that actually mandates tips how funny the service definitely makes a huge difference to the entire dining experience the waiter was so helpful and i really appreciated his help i loved the seafood tower absolutely fresh and delicious yum thats probably the highlight of meal the saragli baklava was so special too normally they are sickly sweet here they are hand rolled and delicious not as sweet
absolutely yupi am extremely picky with highend michelintype restaurants i eat at about per week and am mostly unimpressed i was told that gk was a game changer and quite good i figured that i had to check it outfirst of all the presentation was amazing i was blown away i have eaten at alinea in chicago where they give you a helium balloon made of apple for dessert and everything is extremely well presented in nyc ive eaten at almost all of the michelin starred restaurants and a huge handful of the starredgk for nyc takes the cake in my opinion its better than madison park absolutelyi had a cocktail with watermelon and basil which was so light and refreshing it started my evening off on the most positive note i have a stomach issue and have extreme reactions especially to acidic drinks so it was awesome to be able to choose from a menu with an extensive selection of juices and cocktails to choose fromthe staff was great there was one hiccup where a course was swapped i received the wrong plate and had to switch but i didnt mind it one bit other than that everything was perfect from start to finish the waiter had great recommendations and was very accommodating to my stomach issue its refreshing because even in some of the very highend establishments waiters are not briefed on what allergies mean what for instance a lot of the times when i say i have a stomach sensitivity to acid they bring me a drink with grapefruit or oj in it which are both extremely acidic awesome to know we were in good handsnow on to the food cured tasmanian ocean trout with sweet peas parma prosciutto dill must order absolutely heavenly i tried some of the other starters and this was by far the best foie gras perfectly seared and heavenly im a huge fan grilled maine lobster also heavenly awakening strawberry rhubarb with poached rhubarb buttermilk panna cotta strawberry sorbet again perfectthere were some little things that the waiter brought out for instance palate cleansers which were extremely well presented and tasty i almost dont even want to post pictures to ruin the surprise for a special occasion business dinner business lunch any type of lunchdinner romantic dinner or just simply the want to embark on a culinary journey gabriel kreuther is your place
absolute favorite bakery in all of chinatown they open up extremely early in the morning and work fast getting you what you needive only ever had the honey lemon water here and i can honestly say i have not tried any place better at for their drink it is cheaper than most of chinatown by cents and tastes more refreshing the baked goods here are also delicious as it ranges from centsthe ladies here always remember their regular and are super sweet as well definitely come try this bakery out as even their chicken in lotus leaf is amazing
what can i say about sushi nakazawa it is an absolutely amazing experience before i make this tldr i want to start with the tips how do i make reservation you can reserve days in advance online on opentable make sure you get online at midnight days in advance if you want sushi bar experience sushi bar or dining room table i highly suggest sushi bar experience chef nakazawa interacts directly with those at the sushi bar telling us history behind the different types of sushi and we can take pictures of the entire experience also you can watch all the sous chefs prepping and how they work in tandem at an extra dollars its worth it especially for those who like to take picturesdesignated times for sushi bar and whichever one you decide make sure to get there minutes early as you want to get the center seat right in front of chef nakazawa get used to eating with your hand if you didnt know already each item is offered one at a time with the correct amount of wasabi in it already and you pick it up with your fingers i repeat eat with your fingers the chopsticks are offered to pick up a slice of ginger to cleanse the palate and prep yourself for the next piece dont worry for germ lovers a finger napkin is provided to wipe your fingers after each sushi piece sushi bar experience when you walk in you find the place stunning and it lives up to its money signs the place is immaculate all staff is super cordial they slide all chairs inout for you all staff are wearing business professional aka suits and well groomed the staff is just on point with everything in terms of refilling waters coming by and asking if we need anything else the omakase is a piece sushi sorry need to eat rice for those noncarb eaters the items are offered one at a time chef nakazawa does an amazing job explaining what type of fish each one he is offering us and tends to interact with the sushi bar really well he does a good job walking back and forth so everyone can have a fair shot and see what he is pointing at the sushi is just immaculate the fish is indescribable of the fish is from japan and are changed seasonally based on japans weather and depending on whats fresh out there the other is domestic i dont know how much i can rave if you have read this far but the craftsmanship by chef nakazawa and his staff are absolute artist when it comes to the sushi each piece is amazingly laid out my favorite piece was teh egg custard sushi this is probably what he is known best for for those who watched jiro dreams of sushi chef nakazawa was the guy who practiced for years on how to make the egg custard sushi every day i can absolutely say he perfected it dollarsper person for sushi bar experience and for dining room experience sake pairing an additional dollars for those who want the full experience expect to drop at least for two people including tiptaxalcohol
having never done one of these escape rooms i sort of had preconceived notions a mix of the movie saw and a cheesy office room space with a few locks to open well that wasnt the case here from the very beginning when you enter the first door to the maze of hakainato get the backstory you are immersed in their world the basic jist is that you are to enter a japanese maze to both escape and rescue a boy who got lost in it along the way you encounter demons and must solve clues to get from the starting point until the very end through various rooms i enjoyed the dim lighting and that the clues were very creative and went beyond what you may have initially thought being in a group of was nice as we worked together and different people pieced together different riddlesclues i did enjoy the hints that were given they were good at putting you on the right track the space itself was very well put together with impressive japanese artifacts and letters decorating the walls and some very fun props that totally fit the mood we completed the missions with seconds to spare afterward i enjoyed speaking with the staff on our opinions on what to improve and what we liked but from my friends who had been to make quest rooms like this they said this was amongst their favorite this would be a great teambuilding activity fun for a group of friends or anyone that wants to escape from their phones and reality for hr to get caught up in an adventure i would surely try some of their other room experiences around nyc
i confess that a part of me doesnt really want to write this review because a slightly empty rooftop bar at pm on a thursday is the equivalent of a onebedroom manhattan apartment or avocados rare unicorns that must be protected against all disclosure skylark has ridiculous views especially if you can make a reservation and score a table i love how they turn down the music to just the right level so you dont need to shriek like a banshee in order to have a normal conversation with your friends i love how the rooftop area isnt ridiculously crowded in no part because its still relatively unknown i love how they were patient enough with the frequent changes in my reservation and how they kept my table even when my party was minutes latethe food and drinks are pricey but youre definitely paying for the views and the opportunity to lounge on a comfy couch while enjoying said views from one side you have an unblocked view of the hudson the prickly pear margarita is a godsend on humid august nights as for food we tried the skylark sliders not worth it imo for only three sliders the peking duck wontons this was definitely worth it the guacamole and the burrata pizzettefor rooftop bars in general i think its better to get a dinner beforehand and just come for drinks now please dont tell anyone else
rudys is a quintessential dive bar so as long as you dont go here expecting anything else youll have a great time the seats are upholstered with red duct tape there is limited seating the entire place smells like spilled beer and the service isnt exactly lavish the nice thing about rudys is that it doesnt pretend to be something its not it is unapologetically dirty and crowded but the drinks are dirt cheap the vibe is friendly and you get a free hot dog with every drink favorites include the house blonde ale only for a whole pitcher and the beer and a shot deals there are a few including one called the mexican hat dance for only they have some good beers in bottles and in drafts too including the lagunitas ipa one of my favorite beers for a mere you have to ask for the hot dog but make no mistake theyre totally free and while they werent exactly gourmet they hit the spot and were great with a beer ive been wanting to check this place out for a long time and it did not disappoint oh tip they have a back door to rudys back yard that allows you to drink your cheap beers in a more open outdoor location really nice during the warm months
let me start off by saying yaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssssssi have been living in harlem a little more than two years and i didnt make my way to ricardos steak house until yesterday for the first time my friend and i got there around on a tuesday night there was security outside that was asking if we had a reservation kind of bizarre because i thought that was something i would speak with the hostess stand regarding anywho we opted to sit at the bar area vs a table because that is what we prefer the bar set up contains about seats and it is kind of an awkward set up due to half of the bar facing part of the open kitchen and shelving blocking your view and then the other half of the bar you view is obstructed by large jars of sangria i believe it is more of a service bar if anythingso dont expect to really know your bartender i will say the good thing about sitting next to an open kitchen is seeing and watching the food being preparedfor drinks we started off with the roja sangria in a carafe which was about and we each got about full glasses out of it what i loved and appreciated about the sangria carafe is they did not put ice in the carafe and only in your glass i hate when i order a carafe from other places and the ice waters down the drink smart on your part ricardos steakhousewell played since we were sitting next to the kitchen we got to see alot of dishes prepared at ricardos you can really tell not only the servers but also the kitchen takes pride in their work the presentation or plating of the food is out of this worldafter drooling over all of the food i decided to get the shrimp alfredo penne pasta shrimp alfredo is such a simple dish you can find at any restaurant but honey they knocked it out of the park it was well seasoned and the sauce was not thin but thicker and creamy i loved every minute of the entree you ever eat food and get to the last bite and instantly become sad that happen with me last night my friend ordered salmon al vodka pasta and she said it would be worth commuting from brooklyn to harlem for againas far as the ambiance it was pretty rockin on a tuesday evening their playlist is awesome from biggie to mint condition to solange i think there were people there celebrating their birthday and each time they would bring out a cake with sparklers on it to some hip hop birthday inspired song rihanna cake trey songz say ahh or chainz birthday song i loved every minute of my experience at ricardos steakhouse the only thing that is a bummer is there is only one bathroom other than that i plan on spending my birthday dinner at ricardos soon
we need to talk about han sushii know what youre thinking but jenn all delivery sushi places are the same theyre overpriced or extremely cheap and the sushi is sketchy at best the food is subpar and they probably didnt exactly nail your order not han though not hani discovered han sushi one day on seamless when i accidentally searched for sushi instead of using their cuisine type feature pricing was extremely reasonable reviews were great and i hadnt tried it before why not i placed an order estimated wait time was minutes or so not minutes later my doorbell rings that cant be the sushi right wrong the delivery man runs up four flights of stairs to my apartment and hands me the bag whatnot only that but the food was outstanding as far as delivery goes this must be a fluke i tell myself as i stuff my face with a tuna roll this was a one time thingi now have ordered from this place times and only once did anything deviate from the exact situation described above sushi guy running up the stairs and all that guys is awesome and you will love him one time my food was late and by late i mean maybe minutes late i am not exaggerating the delivery man apologized to me three times the same guy who never judges me for ordering enough food for people even though he clearly sees its just for me fast fresh and never forgets my extra side of ginger dressing a for han sushi and a for awesome delivery man
having patronized this restaurant growing up in the les i have gone through about four different closuresrebranding of this restaurant to its current iteration good cantonese food in chinatown is becoming more and more of a relic in recent years but wus remain one of the best that the manhattan has to offer solid selection of noodle soups rice plates stirfried dishes and dim sum will forever allow this spot to be a popular fixture for locals the new renovations are a welcomed upgrade as brightness and cleanliness appear to be focal points prices have certainly gone up a bit but value at wus will still be as good as it gets even in chinatown

depending on what area of town youre in independent coffeeshops can be a warm and fuzzy haven grumpy is no exception and other than the logo no one here is actually well grumpy if you work in midtown the caf√© is a respite from your office and from the noisy streets of times square and herald square surrounding it grumpy truly serves a fantastic espresso i usually get a soy latte and yes theyve got almond milk too though keep in mind iced lattes are cents extra they roast their own beans and every cup packs a punch i come here on a regular basis and personally speaking of grumpys seven locations this one has the best energy and overall fun baristas grumpy also has many carbheavy pastries and as it is with many of their caf√©s this grumpy is laptopfree while many may see this as a negative it keeps the tables open for the midtown latte aficionados and there is usually a place to sit if you want to chill for a bit
i walked up and down street looking for lb tub of mizani relaxer i know the trend is natural but this is sheer laziness on my part yes laziness natural hair takes time and the kind of skill i just dont have or salon money i dont have either so creamy crack it is at for a tub that will last me until next year its the best value around those dusty tubs the other stores had ha it was the same story with the neutralizing shampoo to feels get out of here sure id love someone else to do my hair but at before tipping the stylist and the shampooer nah ill just vaseline my hairline and go to town on myselfby the by all the mizani isnt together its usually in a section by the cashier because that brand is rife with high shrinkage items this tub was with the other tubs in the aisle just ask the really tall really friendly guy working the floor
surprisingly good its amazing how this shop has not gotten the buzz and food sites write ups it should be on everyones list the price points on each dish is great affordable for the fresh seafood andor curry dishes service was wonderful and you could see its family owned vibei went with the ahi tuna bowl with brown rice all ingredients were fresh and the tuna was seared perfectly with a large portion of tuna the accompanying ingredients all matched well for the bowl such as the garlic chips asago seaweed salad and pickled vegetables filling and satisfying for a meal small spot with a long table and a table for two with most folks either taking our or eating quicklyill definitely be back and will go for the curry katsu next
ill just start off by saying this place is great for anyone that doesnt know dinnertable is like a reverse speakeasy of sorts there is a bar in the front and then there is a curtain in the back that hides a little restaurant theres no real signage or anything for it so if you dont know its there you probably would never guess my friend and i talked about going saturday night we werent really sure what the wait would be like so we decided to get there around since we assumed there would be some sort of a wait and we could just put our names down and grab a drink out front at the garrett so we showed up about ten to and were actually seated right away the place is pretty small theres one long communal table maybe or twotop tables and then some seating at the bar which faces the open kitchen where you can see them cooking the place wasnt too crowded at but as the night went on the place filled up our waiter came over to ask about our water preference and explaind the menu a bit it was mostly smaller plates with a few big ones he suggested we get two little plates two big plates and share everything we browsed through the menu and decided to get the lasagna bolo for two as our main to share the short rib tartare and the shrimp crudo dish i am generally not a fan of meat that is tartare or carpaccio aka raw but my friend wanted to try the short rib tartare so i thought id give it a try no regrets it was really good it was crackerstoasts with a generous portion of the short rib on top it says there was horseradish in it but the taste was not that strong which i liked the shrimp crudo was also really good a nice refreshing dish then the lasagna bolo came out which was amazing it was so cute it came out in a dish with about rolled up lasagnas and plenty of ricotta cheese seriously so good after all that food we were stuffed and couldnt possibly eat dessert overall everything was great the food was top notch as well as the service i will say the drink selection compared to the bar its attached to was slim but i went with a glass of rose so that wasnt an issue for me since the menu isnt huge i might wait a bit for them to change it up but i would definitely go back
the oculus is a truly majestic years and billion dollars later definitely a must see amongst all of the glory of the new architectural landscape of downtown manhattan there are many shops and eateries in the plans right now one can walk within the world trade center across from broadway completely underground straight through to brookfield place on the far west side all major train connections are there acj z enr including the path to nj the oculus is our welcome downtown version of grand central and penn station
staff were so nice and friendly i went for the rad thai nice sesame flavored dressing with tons of big pieces of shrimp very filling some might say its expensive but for the size and quality i think its great but what i liked most actually were the drinks tried the cucumber lime ginger fresca and it was delicious all the drinks are housemade and sugar free
i am absolutely living for the dead rabbit what an amazing spot with such excellent gracious staff i had been many times to the first floor which is very fun but always crowded its so crowded it detracts from amazing drinks and excellent service from the bartendersat our most recent trip the bouncer made small talk with us as he was checking our ids prolly cuz pete and i are old af and he didnt have to look that hard he lead us to a much different room upstairs not at all crowded classy seating same great drinks and gracious bartenders the drinks here are each which is more than i spend on most whole bottles of wine i dont care get a delicious drink here it is so worth it my drink had like ingredients including aperol the bartender gave us complimentary sparkling water which was a nice touchthe bill came to more than what we had recently spent on dinner and it was worth every cent ill be back and ill be grateful for the experience
oh my god for every dessert person this place is the definition of heaven i saw the high rating and was a bit skeptical because although the taste texture and everything about this dessert was amazing it is not the most photogenic and looks very average but i can tell you for sure the making of this dessert and everything about the ingredients taste very very refined this is an art and to make the merveilleux looks extremely difficult even for the best of pastry chefs i got the chocolate one ate it in the corner and came back to try the coffee one as well after minutes it is just absolutely amazingly light crumbles in the right way and sweet enough to melt anyones troubles away the chocolate tastes alike to the quality of the best chocolatiers and meringue just shattered in the most fragile way i also got the chocolate chip brioche which was a miracle in itself the star of the show was the meringue but the brioche was also amazingly fluffy and buttery and the chocolate was amazing tasted fresh out of the oven one of the best bakeries to check out in the city this is after having been to the most hyped up places and i can tell you for sure this is one of the most impressive dessert shops i have had the pleasure of frequenting in the city i would give them more than stars if i could not even speaking of the great service as the cashier who worked there threw in an extra mini brioche bc she saw how i was eyeing the pastries i thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and can rave about this place for ages if needed amazing experience
im so happy theres a cat cafe in new york it basically saves me a trip to japan except in japan those cat cafes dont charge hourly but alas the money is going to a good cause i came in late afternoon on tuesday and this place was empty great for me because that means all the cats are mine when you walk in they tell you its per half hour a dollar more than when they opened you pay at the end and they warned me when my half hour was almost done although i dont think they warn you normally so keep a watch on your clock you then sign a waiver take off your shoes sanitize and play with all the cats you desire you can also order drinks and snacks and the people will deliver it to you they provide you toys that you can use to play with the cats and an array of seats and tables you can sit at to watch all the cats you want i was reading some of the other reviews and one of the reasons why people wouldnt rate it so low is because the cats are asleep and not as enthusiastic when they see people i wonder why that is oh its because theyre cats not dogs cats have all different personalities some can be very trusting and loving and others need time to warm up to you so you might need some patience but the workers there are knowledgeable to tell you which cats are more willing to play with you which cats you can pick up and which cats are more of a lone wolf they know each cat and the story of how they got to the shelter and theyre all up for a forever home this is an amazing place and im going to bring all my friends here who need a furry little friend i mean who wouldnt benefit from a cat in their life
super excited to write this review and post pictures located in seaport this ipic theater took over the old market place where gap used to be this is by far the best theater ive been to the closest experience ive ever had is with amc dine in theater and that doesnt really compare with this one of course here im paying pp and kind of expect this to be better than amcs dine in reserved seatings here as well so you dont need to rush to get good seats you walk in and whats great about this is the ticket kiosk sure they now have these in different theaters but their machine looked really new and fancy not only does it print out your ticket but if you purchased the premium seats waiter reclining seats unlimited popcorn the kiosk will print out a complimentary popcorn ticket which means unlimited popcorn if you bought the premium seats they automatically bring you popcorn anyways so technically you dont need that popcorn ticket going up the escalators wow such pretty designs and artwork the theater corridor was so pretty and there were waiters standing in front of each theater room professionally waiting to serve customers now we are in the theater a couples pod with seats that recline you get a pillow and blankie very awesome since we all know theaters can get chillyway to cozy up only thing is that the arm rest in between the seats do not go up so fellas theres no snuggling up with the gals p you have a cup holder next to the seats a swiveling table to share all of these things mentioned are the premium seats the waiter service that comes with these seats were great they were friendly pretty quick with responsiveness when you hit the service light and efficient no complaints here minor things i wish they had utensils but most of the food items on the menu were finger foods and i wish they didnt run out of certain foods on the menu because i wanted to try everything food was really good even though most were finger foods the sauces that came with the items were really good and unique pictures posted all the orange seats are the premium seats there is one row of orange seats in front of the pods that are also premium where a larger group can all sit together only difference between that and the pods is that the row has no cup holders but whatever the tan seats are all the way up front called premium seats they are cheaper of course because the chairs dont recline theres no waiter no popcorn no pillow no blankie and of course too close to the screen so basically arent really worth sitting at to be honest if i had to choose those seats id rather do a regular theater if you are going to come to ipic then go hard or go home lol dont be cheapy cheapy lol after the movie or even before go upstairs to the bar on the floor also where bathrooms are located this theater is the perfect place to bring a date eat dinner while watching a movie then head upstairs for drinks right after overall i would definitely come back to enjoy a great big popular film but wouldnt do this for every movie it was a wonderful experience and hopefully it wouldnt be too hard to get tickets in the future

i am a sucker for that little hot and new symbol on yelp thats how i ended up at thai villa was having drinks with reallife friend and fellow yelper desi m at wined up when we decided to come here for foodi called ahead to secure a table and we were seated right away the place was bustling and it felt a little like walking into a sexy thai lair with gold leaves dangling from the ceiling and cozy haremlike booths lining the wallswe both had glasses of wine the chef was sending out an amuse bouche to all tables ma hor a little pineapple segment with a thai meatball on top it was sweet and savory and soft and firm and a nice introduction to the meal and to the restaurant we also got complimentary taro chips which helped take the spicy edge off of some of the food later the menu is cool opening from the middle with three sections despite the cool look i was unfortunately unclear on what each of the sections meant there is preferred signature and classic i was clear that classic is regular shit for your stupid american palates but not on the difference between preferred and signature is one better i want to order from the better one our server lin was super cute and friendly we started off with the chicken in pandan leaves i dont know what that is but i know it means the chicken was super moist and yummy from being cooked while all wrapped up we also had the spicy chicken wings solid for our entree we shared the kaeng run juan which our server recommended it was spicy and lemongrassy and perfect we did not have room for dessert and after dinner plus happy hour i was drunk off my ass but i highly recommend thai villa and look forward to returning soon
i was absolutely blown away by the level of service here sat at the bar for happy hour which runs from and had a great experience with both drinks and servicewhat drew us here was the attractively priced happy hour but id definitely return to try the food plates kept passing us that looked and smelled amazing and the fare goes well beyond your typical offerings yucca dishes feijoada shrimpthey really have a great varietycaipirinhas on hhwe came for the caipirinhas and did not leave disappointed caipirinhas are hard to come by in general let alone on happy hour menus and that made samba stand out among all the other hhs in hells kitchen for the uninitiated and believe me you want to be initiated these simple drinks are made with cachaca brazilian sugarcane rum sugar and lime think of them as a more intense variant on mojitos samba offers their caipirinhas in a couple different flavors currently they have coconut passion fruit strawberry and lime i cant recommend the coconut one highly enough if youre a fan of creamy drinks this ones for you they use coconut milk rather than just flavoring it with a coconut syrup and this gives it a fantastic consistency and rich tastelast but not least i have to sing the praises of the husbandwife duo that run samba and man the bar not only are they genuinely sweet but theyre highly skilled and provide excellent service they truly make guests feel at home bertha was wonderful to speak with as we sat at the bar for almost hours when we were curious about a couple drinks the passion fruit caipirinha and cashew juice she even offered us samples just wonderful wonderful service the kind that certainly does not go unnoticed and will bring them many loyal customers overall im so happy youre in the neighborhood samba cant wait to be back
love this japanese izakaya spot located on top of nitecap this place can easily come across as a speakeasy where the entrance looks like an entrance to an apartment building you need to buzz in to enter the restaurant the space is dim and very cozy with meditative music japanese style playing in the background the food was excellent however quite small in portion our server was very professional and attentive we stayed past closing and he didnt even say anything nor tried to kick us out would definitely come back again spicy cod roe they shaped it to look like sausages it tasted like sausage tooika no uni ae squid sashimi mixed with uni so creamy and yummy with rich uni flavor absolutely love this dish uni sashimi only pieces but the flavor is just right love itkinoko toban yaki warm and yummy love the texture and flavor uni over rice cake im not a rice cake fan so it was okay mackerel sashimi by far the best mackerel i ever had the pieces are so tiny but the flavor and texture are so good saki pudding theres a few gold flakes on it but love the flavorit goes from the bitterness of the saki to the sweetness of the puddingalmond pudding i really like the creaminess of the almond milk on the pudding you eat it by putting the pudding on your dish and pour the creamy almond milk over it and add the strawberriesps some seats have a large cabinet where you can store your stuff while dinning in overall starsminus stars because the portions are so tiny
i booked for a mani and pedi its really reasonable for the area and special nail polishes cost extra they have a decently wide range of opi and essie options gels and essie longer lasting options for extra its a tiny shop with only massagepedicure chairs but nam is very warm and so are the other manicurists and my new nails look awesome the chairs have a variety of charging cables for your apple devices the topper is when i was about to walk out with the cheap temporary foam flip flops and they stopped me they gave me a pair of real flip flops they say i had only put in the front pocket of my purse for the manipeditip and i started to rummage through my purse for they stopped me again no youll ruin your nails next time you bet ill be back for next time not only do i love supporting smaller shops but i really enjoy their customer service
if you are into ramen then mososan is your mecca the broth is on the thicker and soupier side than your typical ramen joint thicker in this case translates into more flavor momosans highpoint is that their noodles maintain their texture and do not become soggy apparentlyand per the educational menutheres a term for this but i dont remember what is that term best gyozas ever i typically burn the roof of my mouth because i dont have the patience to wait for the gyozas to cool down once they arrive served in a rectangular sizzlinghot castiron plate staff is great what sucks about momosan are the long queues if it werent for the wait momoson would be elevated to ramen utopia from ramen mecca you know what they say all good things to those who wait
pocion is a tidebringer in the area of washington heights a neighborhood one would not normally find synonymous with such terms as high end lounge premium cocktails or expertly crafted and presented dishes let alone the dreaded vword vegan of coursewhen i had first heard about pocion opening up uptowns first all veganfare restaurant i was beyond excited when i found out it would be tapas and cocktails that excitement went to the power of and i could barely contain myselffast forward a couple months since their debut and i am totally smitten with this small eatery in the heart of wahi the owners spared no expense going to the nines with the decor and this place is popping walking distance from nyp hospital where i workit has become the spot on the occasions i work evenings usually i work overnight shift and being nearby my house in hamilton heights w harlem it is a nobrainer they even usually have live music or even a djthe fresh cold pressed juice cocktails are to die for and they make a heavy pour with some good hooch that blends splendidly with the flavors of real fruit juice instead of some gross reconstituted fruit syrup flavoring with hfcs and other flavorings that is known only by god and monsantoive had pretty much every dish here and none of them fail to disappoint like seriously everything is another reviewer mentioned that they are pricey but its actually pretty standard prices for tapas if not even a little less dude omg get the creme brulee and thank me laterf
this place has become my favorite ice cream spot in chinatown their menu is both unique and inventive my personal favorite is the straight outta japan the matcha pairs perfectly with the black sesame neither flavor is too over powering in my opinion the staff is also super friendly and easy to talk to they were all great at explaining what taiyaki is and what their favorite combinations are ive never seen a dessert restaurant like this and i will definitely be coming back the hype is pretty intense right now so expect long lines management made the grand opening worth it with bogo deals and free soft serve during the wait overall i had the best experience at taiyaki and i would highly recommend checking it out
so ive done kamayan here and the rest of my visits were for the usual menu ill split my review between the twokamayan kamayan is done on wednesday and thursday nights for parties of or more for and on any other night for parties of or more for the prices include tax and tip but not drinks on my most recent kamayan it was on a sunday for ppl with everyone having one drink each kamayan reservations are only done through email whoever is doing the organizing will be the one who emails them with the information of date time and number of people in the party from there they will email you back with their availability if it is the exact time or very close to it then they will also email you the information on preordering your dinner they usually allow a good to get it all in order as you also must place a credit card in so if youre the one coordinating the dinner then it is best that you know of any dietary restrictions ahead of time when most of the party arrives they usually start setting up the table at this point and will be one of the longest ever since you can smell and sometimes see all the amazing food being set up but you cant touch it yet the table will be fully set up with all the hot food you preordered dont forget to take pictures at this point if you want them once everyone is seated the servers will come around with wet towels to wipe your hands with and to keep so that you may use them to wipe your fingers with throughout the dinner the servers will also gladly do a demo for you on the correct way to eat and if you arent sure maybe checkout youtube or ask a fellow filipino friend to show you p just remember to one clean your nails as well so if you have cracked polish or etc then it is best to take care of all that before coming to the kamayan and two your fingers should never touch your lipsgo in your mouthbe licked the food is all being shared so be courteous and try not to put your saliva everywhere after everyone is done with the hot food they will pass out togo containers for anyone who wants to take home any leftover food there may be then they give out halohalo for dessert the dinner itself is quite expensive just taking into consideration the amount of food you are getting and etc however what you are also paying for is the experience and this is why ive done kamayan so many timesusual menu jeepney has a nice backyard area where you can also enjoy your meal and feels great on those cool fall daysnights we usually prefer to sit in the back if trying to have a good conversation amongst the group as it can get really loud inside the bar is very lively and not much elbow room if trying to have a meal their usual menu is filled with delicious filipino dishes and nothing has yet to disappoint the restaurant is actually quite small so be prepared for a wait if you do not have reservationsthe only downside i can think of is the fact that they arent open late so i can get a silog fix after a late night of being outdrinking jeepney you should consider just being

ah sweetgreen i want to make sweet well lets not get too crazy here seriously chopt and just salad there is a new sheriff in town and his name is sweetgreen this place is ahhmazing they have the typical create your own salad along with their signature salads and bowls but where they stand out is that they list the farm where every ingredient is sourced from now to some where your food is sourced from may not be important and may appear to be upper east side mom elitism at its best my answer to that is hell yes i want to know where my familys food is coming from back to the salads we hadchicken kale caesar salad deliciousapple cheddar kale salad deliciousthe multi grain bread included with the salads was terrific they also have a wide array of healthy beverages iced teas and lemonadesthere is a small seating area but be warned this place gets super busy at lunchtime due to all the hospitals in walking distance the lines dont get that crazy because the staff is extremely efficient and keeps a good pace filling orders the bathroom is also extremely cleansweetgreen i think this is the start of a beautiful friendship
literally so cute the food is delicious and service was great we had a little corner table and few glasses of wine with our meal and thoroughly enjoyed everything you kind of feel like youre in a little parisian bistroits not a huge space so im assuming a reservation is recommended if youre going during prime time those who complain about portion size must not understand that french cuisine is more about the taste and presentation than it is about filling your stomach will most definitely be returning

this place is tiny it seats people and youll most certainly bump elbows with those next to you while using your knife but the food and atmosphere are very worth it the focus seems to be more on takeout and delivery but the quirky atmosphere and eclectic music from xylophone music to jazz is not to be missed we came here around on a thursday and were seated immediately the menu is simplechoose a main a sauce and two sides the actual food presented on adorable partitioned plates though is anything but simple everything is wellexecuted and im hoping to come back soon to try more combinations you can also opt to order as many of the sides a la carte if youd like mains rotisserie chicken i opted for the romesco sauce to complement this crispyontheoutsidebutinsanelyjuicyontheinside main no part was dry and the nuttysweet sauce added another dimension and some necessary texture i was surprised with how many pieces of chicken were on my plate and loved that one of the chicken bones had a paper handle swedish meatballs these already come with a creamy thin gravy so there was no need to order extra sauce the meatballs were already flavorful on their own with sweet browned bits and a juicy center seven meatballs came on a platesides soup the soup was one of the best gazpachos ive ever had there was a hint of rose and a hint of mint which resulted in a refreshing developed soup that never once bored my taste buds it wasnt as strained as i would have liked but the flavor was onpoint pasta ricotta gnocchi with cr√®me fra√Æche no complaints here given the combination pickled beets these came with herbed goat cheese and candied walnuts solid pattypan squash parm first of all i learned about a new squash variety second of all the size and shape made it perfect for a small parm side warm and homey we had the root beer float for dessert because we are children likelihood of another visitvery likely i hope it doesnt get too popular too soon

using up characters by saying im going to run out of characters the eternal struggle thats the only negativity youll hear from me in this review though yerba buena has been on my list for ages before i finally dined here on thursday night so my expectations were very high usually that doesnt work out so well for me but not the case here the cocktails were superb the food was even better and the service was on another level this place is all kinds of fabulousyb is located in one of the hotter areas of the citystraddles the les and the east village in the most platonic way a friend and i made reservations because the space itself though lovely is pretty small though the place was filled with parties of friends on this particular night id say its just as viable for a date spotespecially if you decide to dine tapasstyle despite yb being a smaller restaurant they happily accommodate larger groups we were very surprised to find a group of maybe guys celebrating someones birthday surprising because how many guys do you know that can successfully rally all of the troops for a birthday dinner at a fun restaurant maybe im ignorant but my friend was just as intrigued as i was anywaythough the prices at yb are pretty typical for spanish spots the hospitality and decor here are that of a much nicer restaurant everything is beautifully polished and refined which was a pleasant surprise being the twentysomethings that we are we were totally floored when several members of the waitstaff promptly offered to remove our jackets as we sat down not mad at it as it turns out we got double the love because we had to switch tables soon after getting settled at our table the host told us that he needed our space for a party of four but that hed seat us in a booth right away as we swapped he told us that we shouldnt worry for hed personally take care of us for the rest of the night and this didnt seem forced or overkill or anything like that the dude was just all kinds of classy when words like decorum and etiquette are thrown around well this was thatonto the drinks i had the poquito picante gin jalape√±o cilantro cucumber combier fresh lemon juice and the desert rose rose infused gin prickly pear pur√©e lemon juice the poquito picante though not as aesthetically pleasing as the desert rose is my ideal cocktail if youve read my other cocktail reviews you know that spicy cocktails are my jam do people still say that this drink is thoughtful creative wellbalanced and supremely satisfying its apparently their most popular drink which doesnt surprise me one bit sorry i think ive used that word a lot in this review the desert rose pretty much tastes like youre drinking a posh english garden minus the dirt its not bad but id pass on it if i got a doover still appreciate the creativity thoughour food damage was as followshojas de salmon black truffle vinaigrette quinoa green onionjalape√±o salsa yuzu athe black truffle vinaigrette sold us this was the perfect dish to start off our meal light but plenty flavorful texturally interesting and more conducive to sharing than some of the over options chicharron de calamar blue corn mealcrusted calamari sweet plantains tamarind vinaigrette ai dont order calamari when im out unless theres some kind of twist in my opinion theres always something more interesting to order whoever decided to experiment with ways to bread calamari hit the jackpot with this one the blue corn meal added fantastic flavor and texture which made for one of the best calamari dishes ive ever had both the calamari and the plantains are dressed in equally tasty tamarind vinaigrette for those wary about trying ceviche but are craving seafood this is your babybrisket tacos chipotle braised brisket corn tortillas avocado chipotle salsa awhat could be bad look at the ingredients and its pretty damn obvious how droolworthy these babies are sure its not the most creative dish on the menu but who needs creative when you have perfectlybraised brisket avo and all the chipotle come on friends make the right movetoro taquitos tuna tartar peanut butter aioli chile de arbol cilantro chimichurri afor whatever reason i didnt expect these to come in taco form despite the name if youre hesitant to order to ceviche dishes this is nothing like any ceviche youve have before you get three thin crispy tacos filled with all the fixins here they pair peanut butter and tuna in two dishes here a venture im in full support of somehow it works these are fresh rich herbaceous and satisfying seriously bill standard for tapas in nycas we were in the process of paying the host approached us with two champagne flutes and poured us each a glass for a complimentary toasti told you id take care of you he said mic drop
ahhhh this place was amazing everything from the bar area to the food to the decor to the service definitely want to go backatmosphere super romantic and fancy i loved it the design was eastern asian and had this mysterious feel with the dramatic lighting and gorgeous chandeliers every corner of this place made a statement food perfect the serving sizes arent massive so i thought it was the perfect amount of food we didnt have any leftovers and enjoyed everything to the fullest the lamb chops were perfectly made the spring rolls came with the yummiest sauce the shrimp noodles were a delicious touch to our entrees and the chicken breast was too fried for me but delicious nonethelessservice suuuuuper great our waitress was a gem she really knew the menu inside and out she also made suggestions on how much to order and was spot on price its a bit pricy but i personally thought it was worth it definitely a lot cheaper than other places ive been to will i be back do i even have to answer haha yesyesyesyessss
rorys i have been going to rory dolans way before my yelping days existed located on mclean ave this traditional irish pub has been around since and boasts an inviting exterior that slightly resembles a castle with just as an inviting interior the venue is large and well laidout and like most irish pubs ive encountered they have beautiful waterford crystals displayed in lit glassed in wood armoires throughout which aides in the homey warm atmosphere upon entering the first thing you see is a large rectangular bar surrounded by plenty of booths a few hightop tables plus a raised dining area towards the back of the restaurant there are also well placed flat screen tvs and projection screens spread throughout the restaurant to catch all the events of the day plus your local games aside from their well stocked bar like most pubs food offerings are available through a diverse menu covering all irish american and italianamerican food staples in my opinion rorys food is not overwhelmingly the best but you cant go wrong with a burger salad or some type of veggieproteincarb entree to satiate and soak up your adult beverage rorys has hostessed many a good time of birthday parties opportunites of meeting new people mingled and jigged at many st pattys days parties plus theres also the obligatory friday night move all the dinner tables towards the back of the restaurant and setup the dj for that evenings dance party leading to many upon many good times very friendly and welcoming serviceoutdoor sidewalk seating available party room for special occasionsmetered street and valet parking availablehappy hour on fridays onlydj on friday and saturday nightscome into rory dolans solo or with a crew you are bound to find most of what you need and have a good time
i was hooked from the moment i tasted some of their pok√© on the yelp cruise this year on that faithful night i vowed to try them in person and took the task serious enough as to challenge a fellow yelper to see who would try them first i won go fig sorry g g sorrynotsorry first things first know what you want walking in here was more intimidating than that of facing the curving line of chipotle customers leering at you while you find you way to the end of the line youre super uncomfortably close to fellow patrons and youre pretty much yelling out your order over peoples heads so upon entering either have the menu pulled up on your phone or grab one from the cashier counter or youll be the bain of everyones existence with a large helping of continuous side eye from those who can tell youre a nube a mile away not to mention that it seemed as though the closer they got to closing the more people filed in it took almost thirty minutes to get my food and it was most certainly worth it im one who eats for the love of taste and food so while that doesnt help my waistline i am most happy trying various items as opposed to have a set of courses i love tapas restaurants and places where youre able to build your own menu item its a semiadult way to play with your food and allows for a taste of as much or as little as youd like so while they offer their signature works items i went with the pok√© your way build your ownyou have a choice of the bowl the burrito which is really just a burritosized maki roll or the salad after you pick which item you want you pick your proteins some are raw like the salmon and tuna but they also have items prepared sous vide which is basically sealing a seasoned protein in an airtight plastic bag and slow cooking in a temperatureregulated water bath they prep the chicken scallops and shrimp sous vide organic tofu is the vegan op i ordered a pok√© bowl wquinoa ahi and salmonnext you choose your mixins they offer a couple types of seaweed cucumber slices and even diced mango but i went with the edamame cilantro and shiso leaves for the flavor option youre supposed to only choose one but being me i asked for the sriracha aioli and the spicy ginger and im glad i did they also have the fresh citrusy ponzu sweet chili gochu wasabi aioli and a few others the last two options are for adding additional toppings and some crunch for texture i asked for avocado on the side since it was take out and had them add some pickled ginger as well as masago with which they were generous they also have other toppings including furikake crab salad and wasabi for crunch i went simple with some sesame seeds but you can get crazy with macadamia nuts onion crisps and then somethe miso soup was good for the price they fill up your cup with seaweed scallion and tofu and you fill the cup yourself from the miso soup dispenser on the counter i love miso the price isnt too bad considering a lot of the items are included its just a matter of how many you want to order theyre a little skimpy on the protein servings but again you can offset that by ordering a crapload of addins to get your moneys worth the fish is super fresh and i could seriously live on this forever
yummmmmmmm i wasnt sure what to expect because it had so many wellrated reviews and my expectations were a bit high i am so happy that all the praises are justified i came here for a roommate dinner and it was the perfect set up for catching up with friends the wait staff was super friendly very attentive in refilling our water and ensuring we were having a good time they have wine and beer which was exactly what we were looking for as for the food it was deliciousmy roommate and i started with the pizza bread and meatball trio both were hits for me i would go back just to eat the appetizers the pizza bread was so good and huge in portions six thick cut pieces of heaven the bread was crisp and crunchy on the outside but super fluffy airy and soft on the inside it was strong to hold the tomato sauce and melted mozzarella well add some parmesan cheese and red hot chili flakes and it became glorious loved every bite the meatball trio were three large balls of awesome meat the meat itself was seasoned very well and the tomato sauce was creamy with great hits of basil and olive oil both were plenty to share between two people i was already kind of full by the time the pasta came but of course i devoured that as well we shared the spaghetti and white clam sauce and again another top notch dish there was plenty to share between two people the spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente and the white wine sauce was seasoned beautifully and tasted almost buttery with the spaghetti there were also plenty of clams in the dish like a delicious surplus of it which is great because it balanced well with the pasta and made every bite worth itoverall a delicious meal given the quality and execution of the dishes i would highly recommend it for a good casual dinner with a date or friends man that pizza bread was just addicting also the prices dont break the bank which is even better
meow katz delicatessen has been here for ages and ages now been here a handful of times always a fun drunken not so sober kind of pit stop after an outing came here with my guy friend after dinner and drinks and drinks amazing pastrami pastrami pastramipricey but portion is large even though the large portion doesnt compare to the price but worth it the experience is a must classicthis place reels all types of people its really funny when you start having random conversation with people you know their the best random conversations when you know you have absolutely no filter and they dont get offended
great coffee for a great causego figure hugh jackman yes the actor owns this place and not only is the coffee amazing its fair priced and fair trade so its helping the good people of other countries and helping their business growthis location is inside the us mercantile exchange building so walking into a bit of history here now there have not been traders in this building for sometime now but it is still cool to think this is were millions of dollars traded hands back in the day in addition to that it is across from the ferry and water which boasts beautiful views of the hudson back to the reason you come here amazing coffee they are known for their flate white coffee which is very good but not my favorite i go for the ice coffee black with simple syrup and it is literally the best ice coffee i have ever had seriously get this and you will see in addition to coffee they have a vast array of pastries and goodies in the end if you work in the area or are visiting this is the coffee shop to go to
this place has everything i want in a upscale casual dinner im not sure if we went on a slow night but there was no wait around it was one of the first nice days we had in new york this year so we decided to sit outside the garden is very cute it is closed off and surrounded by a bunch of flowers and herbs we ordered two drinks to start the volver which is tequila based with mezcal green chartreuse lime ginger agave basil and grapefruit bitters it was good but i liked the duchess better which had gin plum early grey tea blackberries lemon and agave luckily my boyfriend liked the tequila one better so we switched to start we shared the burrata which was so good you really cant go wrong with cheese we also got the roasted golden beets which were good but i wouldnt order it again for the main courses they had two fish entrees and we got both mine was a red snapper with green peas fiddlehead ferns and morels it was super delicious but a little on the well done side next time i would specify on how i want it i really enjoyed the other fish as well i just cant remember what it is regardless the fish options change but i would highly recommend them as both were great our waitress was also helpful when we ordered wine and the service was great the atmosphere is cute intimate and laid back but also nice enough where you could dress up a little more i would highly recommend it here it was one of the better restaurant experiences we had as we have been on a search and stumbled into many mediocre places recently
have you ever gone to bed after a meal and literally dreamt about the entire food and experience for the whole night no well i have this seriously happened to me after dining at blue hill im not kidding it was one of the most amazing culinary experiences i have had to date there is no other restaurant food or service that i find to be even somewhat comparablei probably cannot add much more to what has already been said but ill provide a few bits of info that were specific to methe service was amazing from beginning to end i dined alone and opted to eat at a table instead of at the bar i chose the daily menu i discussed my preferences with the server along with some dietary restrictions that were making it difficult for me to choose one option from each course she said that she would speak with the chef about other options we could do i was hesitant because i did not want to modify the beauty and flavors already created by the chef for each serving but the server assured me that they want me to have a great experience and that they are very happy to accommodate almost any dietary restriction or requestthe chef then suggested two items from the first course in lieu of one from the second course as i could not eat anything from the second course the chef also swapped out some of the items i could not eat with items that i could i cannot possibly explain the food nirvana as i bit in each and every piece of the meal i felt like i was in a culinary utopia with the most creative fresh and delicious vegetables and food everthey also created a dessert for me which was gluten free as the standard dessert had gluten my dessert was teeny tiny cubes of cantaloupe on a bed of stone barns honey and with some ginger they also brought out halves of various seasonal plums on the same honey i really cannot adequately describe how beautiful it is to taste fresh fruits and vegetables that are prepared in a loving way to bring out the best in eachin addition to the food the patrons are truly very cool i was lucky enough to have a couple sit to my left that have been coming to the restaurant every single week since it opened in that is dedication and after having my first experience at blue hill i can only say i envy them for being able to do so financially they were both lovely and i enjoyed hearing their experiences as being longtime diners on my right a beautiful mother and son arrived during my dessert course and we started chatting almost immediately the clientele probably clearly reflects dan barbers philosophy of farmtotable as the diners all seemed to have their feet planted firmly in the ground but aware of all the beauty going on around them and sharing it with those nearbyi will try to make this a regular spot for me as they change their menu regularly with the season

im giving them the tops five stars for having all the flavors and cakes ready for purchase this location is very busy they get a lot of tourists people leaving saying theyll come back later ha by afternoon it is really crazy i was helped promptly this am and found my spot at the counter i inhaled the peanut butter and jelly cupcake it was sooooo goodheres the drill one line is to order in front of the display case after your order is ready you take it and step to the right side into another line there you wait to be called to the check out if you use a credit card it appears youre served faster i use credit card now especially since theres no minimum purchase required i think pb and jelly is tied with german chocolate cupcake for favorite it was very good as usual the price is comparable to other bakeries lots of jelly inside and the peanut butter tastes like actual peanut butter i did see some of my other favorite magnolia treats ill return soon for a slice of cake i know how to ask for what i want now they remember me and converse its fun to be welcomed the best time to go is early am see you there ill be the one standing at the counter stuffing my face
i love it here although i have to admit that because i am a buffoon i laughed inward whenever i walked by here the first dozen times or so bd bondage domination sadomasochism get itits definitely steamy from all the buffet tables so i wish they would cut a hole in the wall to make a window because the only other relief from the heat is a regular sizeddoor while in addition to the gigantic buffet tables there are also always at least a couple dozen people in here merrily eating and relaxing and adding to the ambient warmth even if the food werent so good i would still love it because its so fresh there are always lots of people eating so the staff are continually refilling and also it has been my experience that they round down in pricing like me they like even numbers if your plate is pounds they ask for for vegetables or for meats this is something that makes all the difference in the world to me little gestures of generosity are gianti dont bother looking at the food labels which really dont give you more information than your own powers of observation tomato peas okra etc but apparently i really love their vegetable heavy soups and stews because after a few visits now i am just realizing that i really havent had any chunks of meat not that i have been avoiding the meat just that there are always long lines of guys waiting to get at them and im perfectly fine exploring all the other stuff and all the other stuff is really really good the atmosphere here is the opposite of intimidating and also the opposite of welcoming its almost anonymous which i honestly like most of all nobody bothers you and you dont bother anybody how this behemoth city of ours should be lots of people packed into a small space all taking care of themselves and having fun
okay i just love this place this was my time here and it does not disappoint also side note the waiters are all so cute with their denim button downs and william sonoma striped aprons had to say iti came here for dinner this time at on saturday everything was so goodfoodgarlic bread comes on a large thick toasted piece of bread covered in butteroil with garlic man this was good get this to start for the table it is very flavorfulcrispy sweet onions i got this the last time i was here with friends and decided to get it again its bite sized pieces of onion that are lightly breadedcripsy they definitely feel much more healthy and lighter than onion rings but you can compare it to that to get an idea comes topped with fresh parm and a dipping sauce that is very good and creamy get thistomato pizza this was good to share as well thicker crust tomato pecorino cheese and pieces of basil cacio e pepe i got this last time i was here as well and got it again i really do love it its so good and i would get it again all the cheesy and peppery goodnessborsa little purse pasta i adore this pasta my sister and i split the cacio e pepe and this pasta they look like little dumplings and are filled with ricotta cheese the menu says hazelnut and lemon but thinking back i feel like there is a truffle flavor whatever it was it was unreal its also great to split since the dumplings are so rich in flavordrinkshoney fashioned get this if you like old fashioneds love itservicevery good and attentive and like i said cute uniforms
perfection ive not had the perfect combination of comfort sight lines intimacy and sound until stage of manhattan theatre club i saw incognito starring geneva carr charlie cox heather lind morgan spector separate show review upcoming the actors arent micd at least i dont think they were it was very directional and the sound was excellent from my seat at stage left stage is the larger of the two and in the basement it seats or so people so it still qualifies as intimate the couple next to me moved over but i dont think any of the sight lines are actually bad row e was the perfect distance from the stage for me but if you are front row center theres a couple of moments when the actors are almost in your lap hyperbole very high risers so nothing obstructs the stage also very comfortable seats with tons of leg room so comfortable that sitting through an hour min show with no intermission you wont enter the stage i call butt fatigue theres a bar and if im not mistaken two coat checks fully ada compliant with listening devices what i think i love the most stage is a total cellphone dead zonelike i said perfect
situated in midtown in the prime location of penn station and msg this quant food hall will get great foot traffic for a quick meal for commuters folks attending a event at msg or for the corporate crowd for a lunch clean and has ample tables and seats to sit for your lunch with large windows to see outside the food hall hosts food stalls and a large bar area in the back the bar area is great for after work happy hours and the food hall is great as a central place to meet up with people and to hang out with groups highlights for me are the pat la frieda stall serving steak sandwiches the mario stall serving sandwich and soup cinamon snail with their assortment of baked goods and vegans meals and the lobster press for a wonderful pressed lobster sandwichill be back its a great spot for a work lunch

i should have listened to youngest sis when she recommended this bakery to me she had the street cred after she delivered to me batches of biscotti beauties made from that divine chocolate valrhona i ate of them in one weekend following are a few reasons i have to apologize to sis and make up for lost timesmores danishthis is another masterpiece seemingly so simple to put together and yet complex when you eat it bittersweet chocolate is smartly paired to cut the cloying sweetness of toasted marshmallow the taste of the two balanced the pleasant surprise is the crunch that comes after your teeth pass the marshmallow then the chocolate and meet the layers of laminated dough right before the buttery pastry i wondered how gural made this if he baked the pastry first and layered the chocolate and marshmallow after he magically managed to keep the crispness in the exterior i pondered the technique after one bite then promptly devoured it some lucky customers have eaten it hot out of the oven the first time i went i was told a customer cleaned them out and bought forty easy to understand why i could eat a tray of this myself i gave one to oldest sis she sent me two emails saying she liked it in older sis code it means get morechocolate breadi can already tell after eating this that arcades breads are going to be dangerous arcade bakerys pastries are too rich for me to eat more than onewell maybe two in a day but the bread i can eat that for breakfast lunch and dinner this bread packs a few delightful surprises the crust is soft not hard and crispy as in many chocolate breads the doughy inside is like the baguette tender moist and with that same airy quality another wondrous touch were the diced orange peels in this bread i dug out one of the minute pieces it was only slightly sweet seemed more preserved than candied then i dug out one of the small pieces of chocolate a smooth dark chocolate without a strong smell and not in large chunks the almonds are whole toasted fresh and crunchy i put my nose to the velvety bread and smelled yeast not the cocoa i expected or the expresso powder i was sniffing for gural loves his bread so much he does not let any added ingredient dominate the taste of his bread but he has mastered baking alchemy along with matchmaking ingredients when i ate the bread as the sum of all its parts the orange and almonds accentuated the cocoa and chocolate and a wonderfully addictive chocolate bread emerged i almost ate half the loaf in one sitting my bff showed more restraint but raved about this bread tooalmond chocolate croissant another rich creation the layers crackle not as sharply as with the almond croissant perhaps because the filling was a wetter paste a mix of the almonds and sugar and melted chocolate and whatever goodness gural bakes in i expected a more intense chocolate flavor this one tasted more like an almond cream with chocolate flavor a lovely breakfast pastry but the plain almond one i thought surpassed it in texture and taste but dont shie from buying this it is deliciouscaramel apple brioche a pretty ring of brioche with apple pieces on top this pastry caught my eye at the first encounter gural i realize doesnt permit one ingredient to overpower another but understands how well they complement each other first i like to nibble on his ingredients separately to taste them tasted singly each piece of the brioche was good not remarkable but when the browned applescaramelized in sugar and browned butter is eaten with the bread portion of the brioche transformation into wonderful occurs with each bite i also loved that there wasnt even a hint of cinnamon in itlemon sugar brioche i didnt try this but bought it for oldest sis who said it tasted like an overpriced lemon danish but sis you must understand likes an artisanal pastries as well as a cheap processed supermarket pie if its like the other products from arcade i am sure it is very excellenti know i love this place after writing a super long review that i had to put out in three parts live your life without regret visit this bakery pronto

as new yorkers we can all boast and brag about going to the coolest hippest divey yet most awesome restaurants why else would i choose to continue to write reviews on yelp wink still there are those dining experiences that transcend any of the aforementioned its not often that i have had a wellcurated fivecourse meal in a private chefs abode scratch thati never have until recentlyi was lucky enough to be invited to a private residence in the city to experience the fine cooking of chef shuchi the brains behind calories in this particular brunch she made small servings of some of the breakfasts she remembers from her childhood but reimagined and improved upon she served a story with each dish and we noshed on various dishes with oats vegetables meats eggs coffee and cake each with a truly unique indian influence within them her hospitality and warmth is pretty unparalleled and she was very open when we had questions about the food the spices she used her background in cooking et al the two hours i spent at this brunch was too short i can only hope to be lucky enough to be able to eat some of her dishes again it was all exquisite i doubt ill ever have such a unique brunch ever again what a day and what a memory to have thanks so much shuchi
from the moment i walked in and heard the old chinese music floating through the air i knew this place would be authentic from the wooden bowls that the food comes in to the hot water thermos sitting around everything here reminded me of home there were even classic chinese phrases painted on the wall that exactly resembled those i see everywhere in china the atmosphere hit me with so much nostalgia i could not wait to try the food food we ordered the husband and wife beef appetizer which is one of my favorite szhechuan appetizers ever the dish was the perfect amount of spicy to numbing and a great way to wake up the palate for the main event the mala xiang guo i ordered some lamb beef round spam pork belly wood ear shiitake mushrooms squid fish ball get the one with meat inside fish cake lotus root celtuce bean curd sheet tofu pocket and glass noodles it was difficult to narrow down all the choices since they all sounded so good the selection is exactly what i would expect if i went to a mala xianguo place in china they have a great selection of offals too that i will for sure try next time i ordered the spicy level which was perfect just spicy enough to feel that sweet sweet burn but not enough where i couldnt enjoy the food the wang wang milk drink is key to cooling down the spice also overall what an amazing trip down memory lane with some amazing food i cant believe such a place exist in east village and not in chinatown i will for sure be back soon and maybe even order delivery a few times

the poke craze has definitely hit nyc and wisefish is leading the pack in terms of qualityi was both dreading and looking forward to the day when poke would make it big here sure enough the second a video was made about new yorks trendiest new food at pokeworks lines went out the door and hype was blown out of proportion nothing gets people going like a viral video about sushi burritos in hopes of avoiding crowds i went to chelseas wisefish on a sunday morninghaving had both pokeworks and wisefish my vote goes to wisefish pokeworks is good dont get me wrong but wisefish is better you can taste the difference in fish quality and feel the difference in friendliness both places are similar in terms of setup which consists of chipotlestyle byobowls and preset options as well as ingredients and prices a regular bowl at either will run you about not cheap but itll fill you uppokewisefish keeps it simple with protein choices between tuna salmon and tofu beyond brown and white rice you also have the option to get zucchini noodles as a base i got them out of curiosity along with rice and was pleasantly surprised i think of the zucchini more as a topping since it complemented the fish so well and imo rice is a must with poke you then have your choice of toppings which range from scallions to avocado cream to fried onion finish it off with a sauce you can go with a spicy option like wasabi shoyu or spicy citrus shoyu or keep it classic with soy sauce and sesame oil my suggestion for poke is to always go simple rather than complicated too many toppings make it flavoroverload and poke should be all about the fishatmospherei think my favorite thing about wisefish was not the food but the people the girl checking me out was friendly and very informative telling me how they make an effort to locally source their fish and keep it authentic i really appreciated the enthusiasm and genuine interest in her store on that note the store itself is nicely set up with a long table down the middle and a couple of window seats below hanging lights overall id love to come back the next time im craving poke in the city ill be here

i love this coco so much solely because of its location this place has saved me from snacking and given me a boost of caffeine throughout some long days another big plus is that there is no credit card min spend limit here like the coco in midtown so i can always swipe my card for just one bubble tea i also personally like this better than the nearby vivi maybe all the pink there hurts my eye or something and plus they close a lot earlier than coco i believe
the hummus is very good but its not worlds better than what you can get elsewherewhat is better the pita i watched a chef make the pitas fresh putting them one by one in the wood burning oven letting them rise then swooshing them out with her big pita spatula and letting them cool just until they were ready to serve they were transcendent i would come back for the pitas alone you cannot get pita this good anywhere else that i know of i can think of an arab bakery in paterson nj that once made me a pita this good and whole wheat no less and i can think of other very good pitas to be had around the city but this stuff here stands apartother stuff the salatim little side dishes of salad are a mixed bunch and change frequently based on what i had on just one visit theyre nice but not essential if you stuck to the israeli salad that came with the hummus and maybe some pickles onion youd be fine they serve shakshuka for breakfast through i didnt have it but saw others having it imagine a cast iron skillet filled with tomato and eggs baked in a wood burning oven id try it dont skip the limonana limon means lemon in hebrew nana mint these two things they go together
love jivamukti yoga the space seems very authentic the two things i noticed about the facility are the clean floors and the high quality of their mats not only are the mats complimentary for members and drop ins but they are also cleaned right after each use with their laundry machines the term jivamukti means individual liberation jivamukti yoga school embraces the philosophy of ahimsa bhakti yoga raja yoga karma yoga nada yoga dhyana and chanting the instructors here are very professional and they make sure each student receives a hands on adjustment while the breaths are also counted for awarenessi love the spiritual warrior class it is an hour long and unlike most practices it starts off with an inversion and a backbendits different but it works the mats are lined up against the wall and the flows are simple but the way they sequenced it does work a sweat jivamukti open is an hour and minutes long that starts off with oms a chant and a philosophical speech before the physical asanas begin unlike the spiritual warrior class the inversions and the backbends are saved toward the later part of the class when the heats are built the practice ends with a seated meditation follow by savasana on the downside theres only one shower and no mirror in the changing room and the lockers are really really small and its for rental onlyif you have a large bag it wouldnt fit they also have a gluten free vegan caf√© attached its cute but some items are overpriced like to for a quesadillaoverall for someone who must have her inversions and backbends to call it a full practice you cant go wrong with jivamukti however it would be amazing if we can have hanumansana and gong savasana added starsps they also have mysore ashtanga

there arent too many places in the city that have a burger that can stand against salvation burgers salvation burger think steak on a bun like peter lugers and minetta tavern this burger belongs on that listfor those that dont know after winning separate michelin stars at two previous restaurants spotted pig and the breslin primarily for the burger offered at each james beard winning chef april bloomfield decided to open a joint in midtown dedicated to the burger and it does not disappointbloomfield selected her cattle ranch and slaughterhouse personally upstate uses only locally sourced ingredients has a few butchers in the basement all in the name of having complete control over the burger and its contents the meat on the burger is expertly cut and ground inhouse with a high fat ratio that is tough to get right from distributor or store bought meatthe burger patty was about the diameter of a hockey puck and about thicker we had in our party and ordered salvation burgers all medium rare they all came out hot and fresh all cooked to medium rare perfectly all topped with the same crispy onions and perfectly toasted sesame bun top and bottom the flavor of the meat shone through seasoned minimally with salt and pepper and maybe a few other undistinguishable items but focused solely on bringing out the flavor of the meatbloomfield cooks all of the meat over a woodfired grill that is unheard of for a restaurant of this size that is pumping out this many burgers it added a tiny bit of smokiness that complimented well with the onionsaside from the burgers the mcdonalds inspired thin shoestring fries were spot on and the shakes omfg the shakes were amazing i highly recommend the toasted marshmallow shake which captures the caramelized marshmallow taste in a cup lined with caramel sauce and thick vanilla ice creameverything was perfect but there were some bad points on our trip the server lost our name in the app used to track tables when we went back after dropping our name to check they looked it up and twas nowhere to be found they did end up hooking us up with a table immediately but what if we never came back to check and just waited for the textthe place is pricey with the salvation burger a whopping i think it was worth it being in the upper echelon of burgers in the city but damn good burgers can be found for much less in the city elsewherethe ambiance of the place at least at night is a little dark for my taste more nightclubby than fancy burger joint pop some candles in there or something people want to see each other and this amazing burgerstaff was well trained and helpful despite only being open for weeks at the time of my visitoverall stars which rounds up to a rare from me for salvation burger i hope you get another michelin star chef bloomfield you definitely deserve it on this one
id been looking for a way to vary my workout routine once i felt like id reached a plateau for some time now women all around me have been raving and going crazy about pure barre im here to join the crazy train and support all of the hype about this form of exercise to be fair you could find a cheaper barre class at another gymfranchise that isnt trademarked like pure barrepure body vixen crossfit zumbabut i went with pure barre and signed up for their new client special for which grants you access to unlimited classes for one month then youre required to either pay for individual classes to the tune of or sign up for a real membership which i have not yet looked into that said i love pure barre bronxville i would recommend going to a breaking down the barre workshop which i had the pleasure of doing with mariellen this workshop is great for those of you who havent yet taken a barre class so that the instructor can really take the time to demonstrate the proper form and technique i say this because classes are fastpaced and expensive so you definitely dont want to waste your time and money being too far behind the other people in your class youll walk in take off your shoes and be greeted warmly by one of many women with a friendly smile classes are done without shoes and in socks so you can buy your handy pure barre socks with foot grips for in any studio yes its another expensive thing and you probably can get through your classes with your normal gym socks but i find that the grips help yes i could buy my own grippy spiderwoman socks but i just bought a bunch at pure barre and called it a day classes are challenging but thats why you came here right you want to earn those muscle shakes when youre on the bar come into your seat now lift and tuck and squeeze and tuck im actually obsessed with this program you might think that nothing is being accomplished by moving parts of your body just an inch but you are really working i dare anyone who thinks they are in prime shape to take these classes and not feel like theyre working muscles theyve been neglecting so far ive had class with mariellen erica jill p stacey and sian all of these ladies have been wonderfully helpful to a beginner like me and have taken the time to answer my questions thoughtfully i feel like im really getting my money and times worth and i love the environment im sure there are larger pure barre locations in more densely populated areas but the pure barre bronxville has only one studio and that seems to be sufficient downloading the app makes it super easy to sign up for classes which you must do if you expect to participate walkins are allowed but not for platform but its more likely than not that you wont find space in the walkin of your choice because theres usually a wait list before that as i mentioned pure barre is trendy and everybody wants to get in there to feel the burn and build that lean muscle i have no regrets besides not starting this program sooner i feel that its a challenging supplement to my usual routine and i noticed an additional lb drop in my weight after alternating pure barre with my cardio and lifting routine i intend to continue that and really push myself pure barre instructors will help to push their clients too one of my favorite things ive ever heard in class was dont let your body decide when you give up its all about trying to get yourself to a point where you can mentally push past the pain and the muscle spasms once you do youre goldmy cousins wife came with me the other day and we had a blast no im lying we both were dying and having uncontrollable leg spasms but dammit it was worth it seriously i plan to be a pure barre junkie some day and cant wait until i can call myself a member of the club this studio is clean located right in town and youll leave every class feeling great about you what more can you ask for
aside from being very convenient for me literally right across the street ive only been to starbucks once and its because the hours here are shorter on weekends having said that i wanted to wait to write a review since i knew id be coming here frequently if worth it i got the matcha a couple times and although the craze of taking pictures of this green drink has swept instagram recently i was never compelled to try it i saw a couple weeks ago how matcha actually has a good amount of caffeine but there are more health benefits than coffee and theres no crash so i tried it and its not bad however i dont have any other place to compare this one to the cappuccino and flat white were also good another place within the past two weeks that i found that doesnt need sugar thats how you know its good coffee even howard stern has said you dont like coffee if you have to add sugar and its so true ive never been a big fan and always ordered vanilla lattes or mochas to mask the taste the avocado smash is also a recent hot item to order for brunch all over the city why now im not sure ive been eating avocados forever its pretty much the only green thing i eat but it is nice to not prepare it yourself how lazy do i sound price wise i understand it doesnt make sense to spend however much it costs since ive been putting avocado on toast myself for years but they do make it well so if youre lazy or in a rush order it this is my new coffee place

covina so hot right now covinathis place is blowing up and its blowing up fast get your reservations in now before you start the futile fight with opentable its already reaching that level and its only been open a couple of weeks came here on a tuesday night at and the place was absolutely packed foodies all think the same it seems as other reviewers have mentioned theres an odd little cafe in the front which is very casual and seemingly out of place but saunter on down to hostess post new band name and youll start to see the grandeur that is covina expansive bar and an absolutely massive dining area so while it was packed the feng shui made it such that it didnt feel claustrophobiccramped in any way its upscale but approachableupscale and despite the size theres a lovely warmth to this place its intimate but in a totally platonic way everyone present staff included just seemed particularly joyous before i jump into food ill make a few notes about their cocktail program itsdifferent not bad different just different when anything seems original and inventive im going to take note and ill likely think of it fondly so before dinner you get you guessed it the before dinner drinks menu like all cocktails here they dont tell you the whole story on the menu dont give it up to soon make em wait leave something to be desired play hard to get but not with me im too old for mind games anyway i love that approach when it comes to food so why not drinks before dinner i went with covinas take on a lemon drop and chose gin over vodka as my base i always opt for gin if i can impeccably done complete with a generously sugared rim my dining companion went with the boulevardier which was fantastic as well one of my favorite classics remember that part about leaving something to be desired they did that with the actual drink menu we knew the before dinner list couldnt be it for whatever reason we didnt get that menu initially but our bubbly wonderful waitress fixed that promptly from this menu i tried the rose hill sour ice pictured made w roseycucumbery gin mezcalrose cordial lemon juice and cucumber ice which was dynamite refreshing and wellbalanced and that green ice cube i then tried the pass that dutch pop that pop that jiggle that fathail to kween missy which is ginbased dutch genver w apricot and amaro dellerborista rich and boozy perfect nightcaptext here raving about the service me trying to find adjectives to do everyone justice failing miserably moving onto the foodfresh sardines w pickled roasted red pepper and fennel aathis was all kinds of fresh and a very inventive preparation im not sure ive ever had sardines but regardless ive never seen them presented in this way they are very very fishy so if you dont like thatsteer clear but the pickled roasted red pepper added a great flavor antidote to the saltiness of the sardines so my full bite rating remains highhungarian fry bread w smoked salmon kefir ranch herbs athe star the star i felt like i needed to call every single one of my family members after each bite of this dish my mom would remark im kvelling my grandmother would call the flavor mashugana and would demand to meet the balabusta who created this divine dish my dad would try to pretend he knows yiddish and say some phrase involving the word schlep the point this is one of the best things ive eaten in a very long time im not sure what went into making the kefir ranch but that handsdown made the dish yogurtdillcaper semen of the gods the jewish god obviously and the bread was unbelievable as well slightly crispy but perfectly spongy ugh woodgrilled gulf shrimp w red flint florani polenta smoked oaxacan pasilla chile sauce cilantro ai think im on record as saying i dont like polenta but this wasnt your average polenta it was quite grainy which i adored im a sucker for texture i like chunky peanut butter pulpy orange juice cookies and cream ice cream and coarse grain mustard so this was right up my alley the shrimp were grilled to perfection and i expected nothing less but the confluence of flavors in the polentachile sauce combo was seriously something as far as execution goes this baby winshousemade salsicia pizza w roasted red peppers house fior de latte mozzarella tomato ai first need to say that this pizza was my choice i would have preferred the funghi or the fontinabrussels sprout my dream combo but my company hates brussels sprouts and is allergic to pine nuts so our options were limited this all said i still seriously enjoyed this pizza the sausage was everything that homemade sausage should be the mozzarella was fluffy plentiful and heavenly ive probably had better pizza in my life but this was as welldone as ive seen
yum yum ambience cute its a basic pizza shop but cute rustic feel to it with intimate seatinga bit too intimate at times when the place is full we practically had dinner with our neighbors which was sorta semi awkward lol but its what you get in manhattan staff loved our waitress we ordered individual slices but she made a suggestion that saved us money with the entire pie and for seating she tried her best to get us a group of seated although the wait was about hour on a saturday night food yummmmm and so filling one slice is enough in my opinion we got the classic spinach artichoke pie which they are famous for and was not disappointed perfect crust none of that pizza falling apart in your hand nonsense the crust was well baked and could handle the heavy sauce and toppings it wasnt too oily and was perfectly fresh when we got it price the entire pie is and we split it so ended up being about a person talk about a steal no dollar slice pizza but id rather pay for this pizza than for an overly oily street slice with sloppy crust will i be back yes becausepizza
how could this be anything but five stars the inside space is immense and the filtered light is majestic i knew the space was open and we asked one of the traffic cops where to enter at this time because the outside entrances arent finished we had to enter on liberty street south of the station and take an escalator down a few flights once you are in all you have to do is follow the signs to the oculus its worth it the entire development is still far from being finished however the raw marble clad space is terrific once all the stores and restaurants are open it may be too crowded to appreciate currently you can walk all the way through the station and passageways under the highway and up into brookfield place without paying for a train ticket
i was introduced to my very first ramen and pork belly bun experience at ippudo ny in the east village over five years ago i had no idea what to expect then and now years later here i am a selfproclaimed prowell not really i had some time to kill and wanted to eat something before a yelp offbroadway event so i searched my yelp app for asian cuisines nearby and noticed this spot was a mere two blocks away i arrived to this westside location a few minutes before and there at the empty entryway were two patrons who at that exact moment were being directed to their table by the hostess perfect timing the efficient hostess returned promptly and immediately guided me to the last seat at the modern looking communal counter little did i realize i lucked out getting seated so quickly just like the east village location every single customer is greeted with a japanese welcome which thank goodness isnt as loud and intrusive here on the westside considering its more intimate and warm atmosphere i was tempted to order an appetizer but i know ramen servings are always plentiful so i chose to have ramen only the drum heart ramen the listed ingredients looked like a perfect combination that i knew i would enjoy as i waited for my meal i looked around the counter and it seemed as though i may have been the only one ordering this soup and now i started thinking that i may have made the wrong choice but once my order arrived and i took my first taste of this soup the umami jumped right out of that spoon offering hot spicy sweet sour salty earthy fragrant rich bold unctuousnessesoh my goodnessoh my goodness it was a titillating palate dancer of flavors which consisted of fresh herbs pork belly cilantro and all others including the largest perfectly poached egg i have ever seen all of these surrounded in a broth that had this look of charcoal and look of deep dark chocolate which looked scary and intriguing all at the same time all of my senses were engaged in this ramen experience i never finish an entire bowl of ramen but for this i had to i will say that i am glad i came in not reading any prior reviews that may have swayed me to try what the masses had been ordering my decision turned out to be a very good one indeed for an impromptu visit i was happy with everything the impeccable service of the waiters hostess bussers chefs all efficient and friendly and run this operation like a well oiled machine an experience i would love time and time again my last note upon leaving a little less than an hour later i could barely get out of the restaurant as the previously empty entryway was now hella crowded with patrons waiting to be seatedippudo westside well worth the wait
the food here is consistently great and cheap my go to is the duck with rice and the chang fen with fish balls ah writing this is making me want the food the man packs each lunch box to the brim with food so you definitely get your moneys worth the roast pork is delicious as well you can get an amazing meal for about or less there is a long line always for the duck but i believe you can skip and just ask for chang fen if you want i havent tried that but thats what my friend says
when i moved to new york from california san francisco my family thought i was crazy how will you survive the winter they said will you live in a safe neighborhood wont you miss your friendsdo you have health insurancemy short story begins when i am sitting at home in my new apartment in chelsea about weeks after my move hmm you know what sounds good mexican i text my new nyc friends where can i get good mexican cafe cubano horchata pedros tacos they say tacombi would not disappoint i was assured i cannot express my disappointment when i tried these places these places are not authentic mexican and they lack in the flavor department i never would have thought the real reason why i would consider moving back home to the bay area would be lack of real tasty mexican food in new yorkim so glad i found los tacos i will wait in line until they close just to get real tacos i dont care what it takes the salsa is on point and is actually spicy my favorite are the pork tacos and i always get a side of guacamole thank you taco gods
what a breath of fresh air a vegan restaurant without any soy protein in sight purely focusing on plantbased foods and making them absolutely delicious for we shared toasts cold dish and hot dishes the carrot toast and fennel hummus toast were both very tasty great flavor and texture combinations the salt baked sweet potato was like a hearty potato salad quite a substantial dish and so pretty to look at the maitake mushrooms was my favorite its easy to love these mushrooms great sear meaty interior with a few bits and pieces of other vegetables to pair bites with the basmati rice is a good option if youre looking for something more filling its similar to a risotto and again the presentation was gorgeous make a reservation since its so easy to because the space is pretty small and request a seat at the bar so you can watch all the cooking in action service couldve been more attentive but everyone was nice including the chefs perfect if you want a lighter meal especially for springsummer and of course perfect excuse to grab ice cream afterwards could not resist big gay ice cream across the street
brunchit all started a few decades back on a small farm in southern ireland a black rooster sat motionless on a fence for years until one day it flew across a kitchen window and startled an irishwoman look at the black flying cock she yelled her young son astonished by his mothers reaction opened this restaurant in honor of her memory who nyc professional brunch crowdwhat bottomless mimosa bloody marys and bellinis the alcohol is flowing without a question and frequently and generously refilled into pitchers the minute limit is more of an effort to keep you alive than to kick you out of the restaurant the brunch menu caters to those seeking creative breakfast options as well as those who are ready to jump to lunch when the brunch crowd thrives from where murray hillwhy if you looking to mask the sunday scaries with a strong bellinibuzz while you eat fantastic food this is the spot the menu has something for everyone and the service is fantastic they do not take reservations but they encourage you to start your bottomless at the bar while you wait for a table for you can enjoy several beverages and a great meal after this meal ill never go back to the smith or sarabeths again overall this place deserves a strong recommendation
organic farmtotable local sourced ingredients korean food chandlers voice can it get any better than this my friend and i came at lunch time around on a monday there were a other tables occupied there was more enough seating its pretty spacious for restaurant in manhattan for now the lunch service is cash only foodwhat we ordered lunch special uni bibimbap with optional nutty salad and vegetable dumplingskalbi dumplings tofu and kimchi uni bibimbapim incredibly in love w uni theres a lot of different textures going on in your mouth the soft butteryness of uni the crunchiness of the quinoa three different types of sweet and salty masago fish eggs that pop in your mouth comes all over a bed of white rice it also includes a side of chopped up kimchi koreanstyle pickled cucumber lettuce and spring greens its recommended to mix it all up i like to keep it a little separated so you can experience the flavors of the ingredients individually and your mouth doesnt get too bored but its far far from boringit came with a side of slightly spicy miso soup w green onions nutty mixed green salad kimchi and vegetable dumplingsvegetable dumplingsi didnt even realized there was no meat in there its lightly fried sprinkled with sesame seeds and seasoning and yum kalbi dumplings according to my friend the kalbi dumplings tasted like real kalbi but now instead of get big serving size you can get it in dumpling form comes with pieces tofu and kimchi the tofu were little fried nuggets of deliciousness with a side of wilted kimchi the kimchi was aged perfectly and had the right texture that complimented the bite size tofu all my plates were clean and empty a sign of a good meal service its so awesome when restaurants leave a bottle of water at your leisure whenever your glass get empty when our vintage milk water bottle was empty it was quickly replaced by the server the staff didnt rush us at the end i love that decorlove it feels upscale hipsteresque metal chairs wooden tables wooden trays wooden walls wood everything very sustainable my friend and i joked about how the big moon in the middle is actually representative of a big radish tip free cocktail soju w check in saving it for a rainy day
i first came here around years ago so was overdue a return visitnow im a resident of manhattan what seemed cramped now becomes cosywhat seemed noisy now becomes atmospheric and thus so it was with palma it was significantly better than i remembered it to be simple and superb italian food in cosy and atmospheric surroundingsmy advice keep it simple here and the quality of the ingredients and cooking comes to the foresimply delicious pastai wont be leaving it to my next visit
this place reminds me of little house on the prairie for some reason walking in place is narrow railroad like kind of restaurant country looking from the front looking and walking in it looked like seatings where limited but they had a secluded like section seating towards the back and a little outdoor patio the patio is so cute we were seated right away in the back party of this place does not take reservations so first come first serve drinks half a pitcher of bellini brunch menu benedict royal brunch served w smoked salmon egg cheese sandwich w fries mussels chicken waffledessert brownie hazelnut w vanilla icehonestly and surprisingly everything was delicious i was surprised that they served mussels on the kids menu and did not have that on the brunch menu we adults love them more than the kids so we ordered of the mussels the portion and the size of the mussels were quite appetizing where as other places served pea sized mussels kids menu they eat free during dinner hours i believe if i read correctly service was great and attentivewill definitely be back
this is the perfect spot to have breakfast lunch or a coffee date the whole family were running around the city and while we waited for my husband my son and i stopped in for some brekkie based on the yelp ratings i had a good feeling about the place plus the food pics were appetizing its a cozy caf√© but they made use of every corner to allow for ample seating its way bigger than it looks upon entry we chose a sunny table at the front entrance and the employee taking care of the counter did double duty and came to get our orders they have a large tea selection that i couldnt choose from so i went with the fresh squeezed red grapefruit juice my son had one of their tropical smoothies made with coconut water we both ordered the nuotatore sandwich which had a little cream cheese smoked salmon tomatoes and spring greens it was served with a small lightly dressed salad and was really good it was just enough food to satisfy us while in the city but i wish we wouldve ordered one of those sandwiches and a quiche so we couldve had the opportunity to try a couple of items hindsight is have a small menu and food is prepared well and if ever in the area again i would definitely have to stop in
the last time i saw the rockettes live i was a kid we had an opportunity to see it on july and i grabbed at the chance my bf hasnt seen the rockettes either in many many years lets just say i got really excited at the first scene when the rockettes came out i love the way they dance in unison there must be about of them the costumes that the rockettes were wearing in each scene were really nice too they are mesmerizing to watch with their perfect formations and perfectly unison kicks and choreography i love how ny the rockettes are the story plot is pretty light its about a family visiting nyc on vacation and the two kids get separated from the parents in grand central subway station so we follow the kids as they go through a nyc adventure as they try to find their parents again we follow the kids to some pretty iconic nyc sites such as the met wall street and the bull nyc public library main branch with the lions central park and the alice and the wonderland statue statue of libertyellis island empire state building grand central station and of course the rockettes the famous statues all over nyc come alive to help the kids reunite with their parents i felt like i visited everywhere in nyc without leaving my seat that was pretty awesome this show is a tribute to everything that is nyc the special effects lighting visual stage design costumes puppetry choreography etc were all awe inspiring the egytian scene was cool the rain on stage looked fun the couture costumes everything was top notch in this show its definitely worth the money a lot of the numbers and scenes just wowed me i never realized how big the stage was until i saw it from the mezzanine to fully see the wonderful rockettes kick line and multiple dance formations the best seats are from the front center mezzanine to also see the special effects that light up the entire theatre the front mezzanine is the best seat if you sat in the orchestra youll miss how the rockettes dance formations look like from the top and you would totally miss the action happening on the sides of the theatre that are eye level with the mezzanine there is also no way to see from the orchestra the special effects and lighting of the entire theatre in a lot of the different scenes which all were very impressive there is definitely more special effects and lighting design in this production than the majority of the shows on broadway i would totally recommend this show over others on broadway if you are looking for flash or pizzazz it was definitely a really fun show
this is my goto supermarket whenever i am in the chinatown area i think i am very partial to it because it was here where i was able to accomplish one of my life goals walk into the middle of a top chef filming when they run through the grocery store to prepare for their next challenge it was during top chef allstars which was even better because i recognized everyone running around now i am digressingback to the supermarket this place has a plethora of asian sauces snacks vegetables fruit dry noodles and meatsjust to name a few things i think what they are most wellknown for is their cheap good sushi you can get a full salmon roll for less than and the quality is not bad at all overall a good reliable supermarket where one can get a wide variety of asian goodies
i lived in la for five years before moving to nyc this place has this comforting feeling and the best tacos in new york city and trust me i have been on the hunt for a good taco for a year nowheres what you need to guac tacos marg less than in new lengua tacos lengua tacos you need to get them the margs are real and they be real the menu makes me laugh damn right they dont got fajitas la teams are featured here as an avid bay area supporter i only state this to establish the environment of the i may or may not dream of the guac cause im so far from cain terms of the turn up this is a restaurantbar with more emphasis of the restaurant if you want a bar vibe this probably isnt the spot for youwhen it comes to deals versus quality of food versus vibes this is easily one of the top places in nyc i highly recommend this spot if youre in ev its a local hangout with some of the best mexican food you can find in the city
five stars for service five stars for taste five stars for making us feel welcome and special portion size five stars and selections five stars it is hard to find anything wrong with tonights meal i wont sleep tonight im so full ive got a couple more photos on my daughters camera there were so many courses i cant remember all the names they asked up front about my allergies i feel comfortable knowing my food was prepared with my health in mind they even have a little stool to put your handbag on instead of on the floor lovely atmosphere not overly gaudy im definitely not a food review writer this was a once in a lifetime experience for methanks to everyone involved for a memorable evening my photos will have to tell the story
i think it is safe to say i fell in love with wonderful establishment at first sight i have seen a couple of blogs and press releases written up about this amazing space and it has everything needed to breathe life in to this part of harlem i think it was a number of things won me over such as the ambiance decor service drinks and bar menu i went on a saturday around because i was just meeting up with a group of friends for a drink of two it was rather quiet and mostly that is because they were probably switching over from brunch to dinner time the mixologist cyllan was inviting and very informedlets make this clear he has his craft down to an art and he is serious about it drinks are about bucks a piece but i consider worthy of forking over my hard earned dollars after several drinks i decided to try a dish off their bar menu and the cod fritters sounded great after having a drink or two it was a great appetizers and definitely had me wanted to come back to try the dinner menuaround or ish it picked up and almost every table was full with patrons along with the bar my advice to you my fellow yelpers is get reservations this is a place you want to bring your lady or male friend to leave a lasting impressions grab casual drinks or have a fab ladies night out i look forward to coming back soon
ah the glory of gotham there arent too many places like this left from the imposing entrance at the corner of the block to the stout yet friendly security team that seamlessly lurk in the dark corners this place screams in a muted whisper the grandeur of all things vintage and charming the mystique of watching this place transform for each event is a luxury afforded to its employees only even if you happen to be hosting they will allow you entry only after the basic accommodations have been met akin to an opera singer prior to a show no secrets must be revealed i love that they can do so based on their expert attention to detail and professional staff the staff is both professional yet approachable despite the large crowd that this venue can hold in the main room and in the multiple alcovesrooms there is never a worry as the space is ample think fairytale ballroom it goes without saying that the place is immaculate carpets are rich and plush and the floor is heelstiletto friendlycatering is also well executed all of the items in the four course dinner were delectable and service was well timed sadly there are no food pictures because in this environment it is just uncouth bar service was efficient quick and courteous i can honestly say i enjoyed every aspect of the evening and if forced to sum it up in one word superbold school charm that makes the hustle and bustle of the city disappear must be acknowledged i would recommend for any special eventoccasion and i cannot wait to return
i thought this place was better than west malaysia and nyona its such a hole in the wall and i never knew this fusion restaurant existed until my sister mentioned it to me their roti was at least cheaper than many other places which is a steal and the pancake was such an interesting texture taste which i enjoyed plenty the chicken wings stuffed with sticky rice was also interesting it was really crispy and tastymy sister had ordered a tofu chicken and rice dish and the sauce they had smelled amazing and it was a good amount of serving and delicious i had the hainese chicken and their chicken serving was generous what really amazed me was that they served their hainese chicken with hainese flavored rice every other malaysian location i went to serves hainese chicken with basic white ricethe steps are a bit steep so i wouldnt come here if youre drunk as you might roll down the stairs but do try this place as they have great service are never busy and in my opinion serve up some delicious malaysianindonesian food
about a month ago at my work i noticed one of my coworkers beautiful knives after he removed it from its wooden sheath being that id only experienced those crapping plastic bland guards i was immediately in awe of this new set up after a few uses of this togiharu petty knife i was sold i had to have oneto my great surprise my wonderful mother took action before i could and purchased a togiharu petty and santoku knife set for me thanks ma d to make sure the knives would stay as magnificent as they were on the day i received them i traveled to korin to purchase proper wooden sheaths and ask about sharpening stones all i can say is i received the most educational and pleasant help ive ever received when shopping for knives or their accessories the attendants are so knowledgeable and friendly from the moment you get there they greet you and guide you through the store answering all your questions and giving you all the information you need to pick the right knives and accessories truly a serviceafter a few weeks of working with my new togiharus im so thankful to have come across them what absolutely amazing knives theyre relatively lightweight have a handle which fits comfortably in my tinywiny hand and have a slightly thinner bland then european style knives thus allowing them to be more easily sharpened and allowing you to perform precision cuts with ease butcher meat and fish like nobodies business hot knife through butter and not crack root vegetables when cutting just be sure to not leave this knives wet or exposed to acid for too long they will rust and discolormy advice to you if you are a culinary professional take the time to travel to this playland youll be there for longer than you think and leave with a lighter wallet but youll have a blast if youre a home culinary enthusiast still pay korin a visit youll find flatware that will be perfect for your next extravagant dinner party learn a ton about knives and how to care for them and maybe even get a show from their inhouse sharpener working his magic on the giant stone this place is so awesome
peter is definitely the man with the hands on chloe cs review and recommendation i came here after a massage therapist i like was too sick to work on me i like my massages the way i love chocolate better not to have a massage than a bad one but i was in severe pain i usually pass on these cheap asaian spas because i feel like i am taking advantage of an overworked underpaid drone and end up tipping percent for what has always been a mediocre session luckily my tip was not out of pity he has more feeling in his hands than many massage therapists i know and is professional and accommodating if you are open to a different style than swedish you can have your knots worked out here they end with a few minutes of hot stone picky person that i am i bring my own lotion and you can too the place is definitely no frills with tables with a hole for your face the tables are harder than at a posh spa but if you want deep tissue its better for that work anyway the rooms are stalls with curtains for a door so if you want quiet come at off hours it is clean its a win win if you plan it right the price is cheap enough at an hour so you can leave a generous tipi always hand it to them directly btw for an underpaid talented worker and you leave feeling better body wise and karma wise
goodies for cheap if your looking for some snack and candies glore but your looking for an upper classy feel then you would want to come here literally i come to this location for all my pocky needs japanese candy sticks they value at only per pack which is not bad at all especially because of the fact its considered an import five below is also known for having some rare candies such as those bottle pops pop rocks and those flavored jelly beans just to name a few they each value at roughly each so you can go stacking up and turning your own home into an old school candy storeother notable itemsthey have phone cases usually worth and selfie sticks to take that candid shot of your entire group they carry spots things if your looking for something quick to throw around at the park and you dont want to pay to much at places like sports authority or modells overallcome down here and get yourself some candy and cheap juices
yeahhh this is probably the best boba spot in all of nyc they have a wide variety of teas matched by a quality selection of bobas including almond jelly and classic tapioca pearls as many people on here attest the green tea and matcha latte are both excellent choices but i would also recommend you venture into the black teathai iced teas as wellthere really isnt much to say here other than that there isnt a ton of seating you will have to fight armies of hipsters to make it to the counter the tea is a little pricey but worth it and try to experiment if you can oh and dont feel like you have to get milk in everything like every pic on here has a tea with milk but i got mine without it was a jasmine green i think and it was absolutely delicious so dont feel like you are missing out if you go milk free anyway cows milk is kind of on the wane right now and i am not a vegan or anything but when you think about what it is it does become kind of baffling why people drink it at all moooooo
the quick french beautiful and girlie little macaroon shop where the treats are as sweet as the store tiny with not much seating but this little shop is just perfection the details some places live up to the hype and for me this tiny parisian shop is one of them the macaroons are small and each but they are the perfect texture and very flavorful the decorations and boxes are perfect down to the last detail the bow if youre in the upper eastside its worth stopping in for a treat the damage each you can order individuals or a box of six either way make sure to ask for a bag as they are beautiful
when i was growing up my mother used to make me sandwiches for lunch she was a very hard working woman who did her best to put a roof over the kids heads and made sure we were never hungry being as busy as she was she didnt always have the time to make the fanciest sandwiches or come up with a diverse meal plan for us we were on a budget lunch for school was often simply ham and cheese in between two slices of white breadi ate that for years or at least i tried to unless i was extremely hungry sometimes i would just throw the sandwich away im not sure what type of ham she would get for these sandwiches but eventually i just couldnt eat ham anymore i think i told my mother to stop making these sandwiches for me and she never did again i was a very unappreciative kid to this year ive never willfully ordered ham of any kind bacon pork belly and the kind are a different storyfast forward years later and im told about one of the best bakeries in new york cityarcade deciding on what sandwich to get i wanted something on their famous baguettes but when i read the menu i saw the ingredients in the sandwich cheese butter and hamnot wanting any other type of bread for my sandwich i swallowed my old hatred for ham after snapping pictures of this plain looking sandwich i delve in a big bite for this crunchyontheoutside slightlychewyontheinside baguette my teeth sunk in getting into each layer first into the subtle butter then into the cheese and the ham simultaneouslythe harmony of all four simple ingredients in my mouth had me wondering what i was eating was this how sandwiches were supposed to taste with ham this could possibly be the only ham sandwich i can ever eat againnow i understand what my mother had to do to feed three children at the same time while holding down a fulltime job working overtime and trying to get her degree at the same time this sandwich made me appreciate that it brought back memories of sandwiches i ate for years and threw away for yearsthank you mom for all your sacrifice and thank you arcade bakery for helping me appreciate her
weve been back here at least four more times and we love it every time the service is always so warm and friendly and now they take online reservations yall need to get on thatsince our first visit weve tried the sweetened nuts like praline nuts but honestly the cart is better and the kale dip with assorted breads would be better warm but the breads are funthe pineapple and pancetta flatbread is crispy light and delicious it reminded me of the rectangle pizza i used to get in grade school with the cubed pepperoni but far tastier the boy adores the peppercorn burger but my heart remains with the benson burger beets beef lifeits a shame not more people seem to know about the churro ice cream sandwich which has swirls of fried cinnamon sugared disks with vanilla ice cream and honey drizzle somehow light least it felt that way because we inhaled it and oh so satisfyingbenson we love you will be back soon

how to survive a tone house wear long pants that cover your knees unless you dont mind having your knees slide over the come min early so you can stretch the warm up is tough here and you will be sprinting like crazy so stretch its about team its all about teamwork you cheer everyone on you cheer till the last person touches that finish line show up workout hard drop dead in between then get up again then drop dead then get up again finish strong finish proud go home and sit on couch other useful there are cubby holes for your bags and hooks for your coats there is a unisex bathroom but no you are provided with a towel and a bottle of water there is also a water first timers get a special rate of you can sign up for classes tone house is on the second floortone house is the hardest workout in new york i take all sorts of classes at equinox run marathons but tone house was like random hard workout class its like your usual bootcamp class but on crack to be honest i was so nervous coming here i already felt like puking in my uber i dont even feel that nervous going for a job interview i got there early and started stretching i didnt know anybody going there obviously there were some others who showed up with their friends but the camaraderie and team spirit is so great that everyone will cheer for you that you will feel as if the whole team is your friend my coach was tamara and she was excellent half of my class happened to be newbies aka first timers so i felt a little less intimidatedwell as i mentioned above the warm up isnt some simple stretching the warm up is tough according to tamara if you can survive the work out you can survive the class we spent the first min sprinting over these blocks with the faster people going first and the slower people behind the faster people will catch up with the slower people so you better keep running you will have to jump over the hurdles and also jump over them sideways you will even do push ups in between those hurdles after the first min i was pouring in sweat and panting now for the real work out we did lots of bear crawls we also got into a plank position put sliders under both feet and dragged ourselves from one end of the room to the other with our arms tamara also divided us into little groups of people and each group would take turns doing certain exercises putting the gliders under your hands and pushing them with your legs getting down on all and hoping forward with your legs then moving your hand forwards then hopping again till the end of the room etc while doing these the rest of the class would cheer you on i wasnt the fastest at moving around on gliders under my feet while holding a plank position and trying to pull myself forward in fact i had to take lots of breaks on my knees which is why you should wear long pants that cover your knees and ended up being the slowest of my group i must have been with ultra fit athletes or something what got me through doing laps was the wonderful team cheering me on tamara even came beside me and did it with me and helped me get to the finish line i still remember standing up with sweat dripping down my red face and everyone was clapping for me telling me i had done a good job there was one girl in my group who hid in the toilet at times because she was scared to do the exercises my philosophy is to suck it up and do it and finish strong it doesnt matter how old you are or how fat thin you are just do it mind over matter however i would strongly recommend being in decent shape if not you will probably end up puking we also did push ups with gliders under our hands the last set of exercises that we did was lunging back and to the side followed by jumping lunges i have fairly strong legs i can run marathons however tone house had me burnt out i realized my quads were so exhausted that i could barely jump my jumps were getting lower and lower haha i was actually shocked that my legs were this tiredfinally we got into a circle and did all sorts exercises like burpees push ups running in place etc you feel like a hero when you are done i was so tired i had to outside and sit somewhere just to catch my breath i felt as if i was still panting and sweating min later yes its that hard of a work out its no joke i came home and sat on the couch for another mintone house takes working out to a whole new level you might want to cancel partying plans after tone house because sitting on the couch after that with a bottle of wine and some cheese trader joes is nearby is the way to do it

man this place is eerie at firstlike dusty victorian meets the porn music from walk through an art gallery and open the narrow door in the back left corner and youll find a cool secret oasis of cocktails and comfy furniture that immediately reminded me of ranstead room in philadelphia the cocktails here are fantastic vanishing point and midnight in paris were both fantastic and for apiece they were well worth it bartenders are friendly yet professional and the experimentaltrip hop music lends to a curious ambiance thatll have you coming back for certain
i normally dont review bodegasdelis but ill make this place the exception because i am impressed i also just really wanted upload a picture of my awesome salad unreal outside of chinatown super affordable prices quality meats by the pound chicken that is actually quality chicken breast rather than chicken breast and base salads i hope this place never changes one suggestion please update your seamless menu with more options eg specific ice cream flavors and snacks like clif bars for those of us who are truly too lazy to cook andor are hungry at in the morning
patience and fortitude conquer all things ralph waldo emerson andor fiorello laguardia five stars hot new bar in lescame here on a friday night not realizing theyd just opened the night before i read an article written in the fall about the bar but guess the opening had been delayed a bit it was so nice to experience the place when its less crazy because i know in a few weeks itll be impossible to get in also when i visited giuseppe gonzalez himself was the bartender the very handsome halfitalian halfpuerto rican as pablo the server described himto drink the tough room guinness and whiskey sour tastes bright and foamy but unmistakably guinness marissa l my adventurous companion trinidad sour rye lemon orgeat angostura if drinksflavors could have shapes this drink would taste round like a perfect circle its sweet but not deep but not heavy but light and in a weird way tasted like a chocolate covered orange please dont let that description read too specifically and turn you off thats just the only other flavor combination that made me feel similarlythe twin lion rye lemon sugar egg white wine pretty drink with four visible layers frothy and foamy on top with the egg white then silky then the hit of wine very fun czarine vodka dry vermouth apricot liquor bitter mmm tasty marissa again to eat thai chili wings these were perfect right amount of crisp on the skin but soft from the meat served not too hot as wing often are and the thai chili flavor was sweet and tangy without being too thick or syrupy sweet again how these wings usually are i think there were wings they come with a sauce that tastes sour creamyy and an oniony slaw i didnt love either accoutrement alone but the trio of chicken sauce and slaw was divine shrimp cocktail thick big shrimp served on an asiany carrot slaw the cocktail sauce was bomb thick chunky spicy and red lol again i really enjoyed the shrimp sauce and slaw all together short rib buns order comes with two the short rib is good if a little salty dish comes together nicely with a fresh mango slaw on top lots of slaws hereever write a word so much you start to question if its a real word and if youre spelling it correctly yeah slaw just be careful with these because the paper theyre served in stuck to the buns which aided in their disintegration music was a loud but cool mix of alternative rock i think just imagine lots of the killers two servers were working together the aforementioned pablo and a very nice girl named caitlin girl seems diminutive but lady seems aging le sigh caitlin was super excited about all the cocktails and did a great job of explaining them and aiding in our decisions i hope to see her behind the bar soon when we were done i kindof elbowed my way up to the bar giuseppe looked up quickly and said ill be right with you oh thats okay i just wanted to say thank you his face lit up and i could see his pride and excitement pouring through with his ear to ear smile finally super cool the two lions on the logo are patience and fortitude from the nypl main branch apparently when giuseppe was a kid during nycs dark days he wasnt allowed to go anywhere after school except the library swoon tldr get here soon so you can say you went before it was famous and yes ill go with you
holy caffeine batman this armenian coffee tastes just like greek coffee or turkish theres really no better way in my mind to top off a fantastic mediterraneanmiddle eastern meal than with the traditional boiled ground coffee bean concoction but first almayass is absolutely my favorite restaurant in manhattan they are going to be huge you are going to be amazed i tell you its terrific i know food nobody eats food better than me sorry just finished watching the sunday morning political shows but seriously everything that we ordered was in itself an exemplary culinary experience perhaps the best lamb chops ive ever had and they were even enjoyed by my guests who arent lamb meat lovers the list of things we ordered includes over twothirds of the appetizers so im not going to list them for the main we begrudgingly because we were so full consumed the mixed grill ultra highlights of the mixed grill were the lamb chops and the chicken they entertained all my absurdities for instance i insisted they bring me a whole lemon and they did on a plate with a knife to cut it myselfprecisely as i had demanded they are going to become really sick of me
my friends know i like to spin i like to spin a lot in fact if you are one of those cool kids who follow me here then you know i am a complete cyclepath so when i was asked to take a ride up to test out a new spin studio on classpass i said absolutely lets do it i get somewhat complacent in my class grove with my classpass routine so i love when people recommend a new place admittedly i havent ventured up to harlem for anything besides dinosaur bbq but this was worth the trip and i was down for an exploration it is conveniently located right by the so if coming up from midtown or uws it is pretty easy seriously dont be lazy explore your city the studio reminds me of a former beauty salon or barbershop just without the mirrors and salon chairs everywhere you will see what i mean you walk downstairs into a reception area where an extremely friendly front desk girl checks you in from there you walk into the spin room where there are cubbies for your things as well as bathrooms in the back to change the bikes are all brand new they have baskets for those wearing sneakers and clips for any pros with their spd shoes i love that they have the monitors on them so i can think in terms of rpm while i spin it makes for a much more efficient workout harder to slack off your bike comes prepared with water and a towel for you i love that personal touch the studio is also extremely clean i understand you are there to sweat but the last thing i want it to grip onto a bike and have to worry about the sweat residue of the person before you you wont have that worry here at all the class i took was a reggae themed ride what is that you may ask well you are spinning out to reggae music do i know much about reggae no but who cares it was dope if you are new to spin thats totally cool this place is probably perfect for you i love themed rides and reggae made for great spin music due to its controlled nature specifically it was awesome for climbing the instructor did a great job of getting new riders set up and comfortable on their bikes before walking them through the different hand positions with no mirrors it is a judgement free zone in here you focus on yourself the music and the spinning it was a tough class but definitely a good kind of tough i walked out of there with some happy jello legs it felt greatafter class the owner tameca greeted everyone with a nice little surprise of bananas energy bars and coconut water such a nice treat not sure if that is standard but definitely unique to other classes i have taken also the reason i didnt collapse before dinner later thanks again loved the class
besfren is located withinbehind the korean ginseng store on the corner of and blink and you could miss itseriously this is some of the best asian dessert ever after a meal at her name is han around the corner my friends and i dashed real quick around the corner to make it minutes before they close at on sunday this place serves all sorts of baked goods and sweets from truffles to canelle to petit fours they also sell gelato by il laboratorio del gelato however the piece de resistance the roll cakes in multiple flavors and the chiffon donuts so many things so little room in my stomachi had bites of my friends roll cakes and oh my goodness gracious i was wishing i had gotten those the jasmine green tea is different because it actually tastes like jasmine tea not just the normal hardly flavored matcha flavor the salted caramel is the perfect marriage of salty and sweet the cream for both are not too sweet a very fresh milky flavor and filled with vanilla beans which are my favorite i will most definitely have every single flavor of these the next time i stop by this dessert shopfor myself i ordered the jasmine green tea chiffon donut which was unique kind of its nothing like a donut at all really more like an asian pound cake it tastes like the honey cakes you can get at the asian supermarket and is a little moist with some sort of honey or sugary sap the green tea flavor isnt as pronounced in this cake but its still very delicious though sweeter than the roll cakes the white chocolate on top makes the donut a little hard to eat since its hard on top but nevertheless its a great dessert i just prefer the outstanding roll cakes morenot much seating inside so id suggest this as a take out dessert place theyve also got a nice array of interesting hot and cold drinks on their menu also ranging from ginseng lattes to grapefruit yuzu teawill definitely be back
while this reservation is incredibly difficult to secure the food and dining experience are unforgettable my grandfather knew someone who knew people that could get a table and as a birthday gift brought my family to dine therethe first thing i was taken aback by was that a waiter came out and started asking what we wanted to eat and spouted italian options that ran the gamut from seafood salad with lobster shrimp crab and calamari to all sorts of pastas veal chicken meatballs sausage clams a basil and breadcrumb coated fried mozzarella and paired with a simple tomato sauce to create a caprese and other dishes i did not recognize or forgot in the deluge of options they did this in a way that was very charming although it was overwhelming to have these options thrown at you rapid fire it made you feel like they wanted to get to know you as a diner and prepare the meal specifically for you as we were a party of the spread that they eventually presented was incredible and had all of the above mentioned itemsall of these things were cooked beautifully and you could taste the time and energy that painstakingly went into producing every slow simmered sauce and accompanying item and the proteins were all succulent as someone who is fairly wellversed on food but certainly not an expert on all available italian dishes i would say that if youre open to a wide variety of options to ask what the waiter recommends or ask other diners what theyve enjoyed if you feel so audacious as i guarantee it will be unique made to order and absolutely deliciousif you can get a table here cancel any other plans you may have had this is an experience that simply cannot be replicated elsewhere

barneys is in a league unto itself very different from the other big bs bloomingdales bergdorf the store windows are usually decorated with avant guard fashion as you can see from the picturesthe first floor is a wonderland of high end nontraditional department store handbags and accessories celine goyard the bags arent locked inside glass cases if you want to touch one look inside or venture close to a mirror to see how one looks with your ensemble you are free to do so they also have a beautiful display of jewelry from less well known but extremely expensive designers their fine jewelry department is also breathtaking this is the only store in manhattan that carries hermes outside of well hermes the selection isnt huge but the fact that barneys has it is pretty amazingdownstairs is the beauty level which definitely rivals the one in bergdorf bloomingdales doesnt even come close it is a wonderland of highend cosmetics dont come here looking for mac clinque or estee lauder lilab serge lutens cle de peau beaute will laugh at you all kidding aside the sales staff is super friendly and accommodating be mindful when purchasing perfume the sales staff defers to the larger sized bottle without asking you have been warnedthe clothing is beautiful and wearable unfortunately not affordable then again what do you expect from barneys
after having dinner in the area we decided to stop here for a drink after making our way down the stairs we made our way inside and there was a guy waiting there ready to sit us they had the option of a table or at the bar i wouldve loved to sit at the bar but because it was really full we went for a table near the entrance the bar itself is one large room with the bar closer to the bathrooms which are all the way in the back of the establishmentafter being seated and given menus about two or so minutes later we were approached by our server he took a seat as he could tell we were still going over the menu and maybe needed some guidance he asked me what alcohol i preferred taste etc and gave me his suggestions which i took and were greatthe entire place is very dim but it gave off a romantic feel imo they also had some food on the menu which i did want to try but because we just ate i just wasnt going to be able to fit much more into my stomach it came down to deciding between more food or alcohol i chose alcohol xfor me this place is really just great great location great ambiance great service great drinks great quality all around i will definitely back over and over again
wow no wonder its always crowded and the wait is long i was hoping to eat there again a lot sooner but when im hungry i want food like now so waiting almost an hour was a little frustrating when i walked in i was handed one of those buzzers like the ones from shake shack to let me know when there was a table available there were two chairs available at the bar so my friend and i had a couple drinks while we waited the bar tenders were really nice we almost ordered food at the bar but our buzzer went off so we went upstairs where the seating is every table was taken so we sat down and went over the menu and i wanted to order almost everything however i already knew i had to order the pork belly sliders they were amazing we also had the chicken pot pie also really good i forgot what else we ordered but everything was above average i was so hungry and excited about the food i didnt take picturesalso their cocktail list is extensive and unique other than the long wait and crammed seating this place should appeal to almost anyone

i dont care that it will take me over an hour to get here this is the best nail salon i have ever been to and i will be coming here every weeks to do my nailsmost nail salons make me feel awkward and uncomfortable either the manicurist will silently do my nails while avoiding eye contact or try to engage in awkward small talk fresh was not at all like that sabrina was friendly from the moment i walked in the door and fun to talk to in addition the other girls in the salon were all striking up conversation as well that is how a nail salon should bei came in with a photo of mardi gras inspired nails and asked sabrina if she could do it together we picked out colors and discussed how to execute the design and she made it come out even better than the photo i have never gotten glitter on my nails but i am absolutely obsessed and will be getting glittery nails every weeks nowi came in for the mani massage combo but of course paid more for the designs and the massage was greati cant wait to come back in a couple weeks for my next fun nail design thank you sabrina

the easy review is to say if you loved the chapelle show youll love mics but its deeper than that the hiphop that greets you as you enter the theater makes me wish they had cocktail service at the lynn redgrave the vibe is definitely comedy club lounge but again its more than that the titular mics and stools are it as far as staging sorry ive been dying for an excuse to use titular in a sentence for a week now the third mic gets a great workout neal brennan delivers solid straight up comedy club material wicked funny with a cross cultural sensibility that only a white guy who wrote shoulder to shoulder with dave chapelle can bring the first mic not so much the bits are very funny dont get me wrong but it seems a bit tacked on because calling it mics just doesnt have the proper symmetry i was all about the mic though brennan got all up in my feelings we are close in age and creepily close in life experiences no im not a successful comedian writer producer director but when he described his experiences with depression and an emotionally unavailable parent bam and yes dude henry rollins is a piece of shit im currently benjamin buttoning my way through life as well just not nearly on brennans level so to the yearold guy in the audience who said he felt old yeah just wait your midlife crisis is going to be spectacular this is one of the better shows ive ever seen the best oneman show by far these types of shows live or die on their pacing and the writing theres nothing else to distract you neal brennan is a talented writer simple as that hes got you fam his comedy game is bananas
we went there for brunch on saturday about noon there was close to an hour wait for tables but we spotted a place at the bar no wait at all we split a bottle of rose cost a whopping and was not bad at all we ordered the avocado toast to split its a bagel cut in half covered with very good avocado with a warmed tomato slice on each half each topped with a poached egg fantastici got the fish tacos made with large pieces of black cod they were the best i have had julie got the kale salad with substantial amounts of mackerel cooked to perfectionwe like eating at the bar because you can make friends with the bartender and get inside info on what to order and other interesting info there is also a never ending show featuring mixology and witty rapport but i digress we had a great time at seamores friendly food and terrific service we will for sure be back
aye i got myself in trouble with this one i was at the spa next door and i was looking up places to get something quick and i dont know why i chose to walk in here because i have been working out so hard and eating so healthy and i will probably gain million pounds after this placecute charming and smalla simple menu designed to make it easy to order which of course you can still make your own sammy but i chose to order from their array if you dont like proscuitto then i hate you i mean dont come here most of their sandwiches consists of it if you dont like mozzarella or burrata then you need to die i meant dont come here they make their own and its simple and fresh and added to a lot of their menu items anyways their proscuitto was sliced like tissue thin not paper thin but thinner so light not too salty probably the best proscuitto i can think of i got it on a baguette with the burrata dripping out of the sides ooey and gooey with just some tomato and arugula mainly for color jk i devoured it i didnt even give it a chance to look pretty and i still regret giving a piece to my friend who said thats fcking retarded because thats how good it was i really still am bitter about itand the service was nice both pretty ladies genuinely smiling oh and you get a free drink with your order and also the prices are way off online its way cheaper when you go there including their truffle and burrata sandwiches

ive never wanted a place to stay a secret this much id be doing a huge disservice to dinnertablethe world if i didnt report on my sublime experience here but in a few weeks time this place is is going to be utterly impossible to get into so man am i glad i got here this early in the game ive had a number of fantastic meals in my life but my experience here was just specialfirst things first dinnertable is what they call a reverse speakeasy it may be the only place of its kind in the city nestled behind a curtain and a fun little door your only way to this teeny tiny space seats max w one communal tables and a few smaller tables around the perimeter is by navigating through the garret eastwhich is a pseudospeakeasy itself though im not headoverheels in love with the garret its a damn good place to get a drink while you wait for dinner and regardless of how good their drinks are their profits are going to quadruplequintupleand beyond thanks to dinnertable and the waits that will ensue though according to the friend i went here with theyre all part of the same ownership group so its one in the sameone more note for fans of quality italian dinnertable is brought to you by the same husbandwife team even better you can watch them work not only is this one of the tiniest restaurants ive ever been to but theres also no kitchen here or no separate kitchen at least behind the bar the dynamic duo is working awayand are very social while doing so like i said my experience here was its own kind of special before i go right into the magical wonderland that is the food here i will warn you about time when i arrived at on a friday night there was no wait here i was floored well my friend showed up about five minutes later and we made what would ultimately be a very dumb decision that being to have one drink at the garret before heading into dinnertable minutes later we were slapped across our proverbial faces with a minute wait serious ouch but we werent going to miss this given that dinnertable is a small plates venue we shared everything plates drinks it felt like a total steal the major redundancy of the night flavoreggplant carpaccio w farro spicy peanuts mint aideal dish to start off with though id said this was my least favorite citing the world relative has never been more important this plate was fantasticthe rest were just more fantastic the preparation was light yet rich the peanuts added a lovely crunch to what would have otherwise been a soft texture profile and the farro added a good dose of heartinesssmoked short rib tartare w horseradish marble rye aany variation of beef tartare paired with horseradish is going to get rave reviews from me a combination for the ages this plate nearly made me cry because i wanted this dish and we only got it well unbelievably flavorful smoky rich subtly spicy and all atop a perfectlytoasted piece of breadbaked mussels w pepperoni rice awhat a brililant creative preparation ive had some pretty unique mussels preparations due to my mussels obsession but nothing quite like this some might say the fact that these are baked takes away from the flavor of the mussels but i didnt mind one bit more on that flavoryou get pretty much everything here briny salty some spiceincredibly wellrounded the picture doesnt do these justice the dumplings w potato pecorino a to infinity and beyondthese are called the dumplings for a reason the pomp is so warranted i assure you this is coming from someone who never eats this particular type of food these are buttery and creamy and carby in all the rightwrong ways depending on who you are though theyre not posted online dinnertable offers a few cocktails of their own as well pictured is the bourbonchilestrawberrymint concoction which was honestly better than most of the drinks ive had at the garret im a whiskey girl and a huge fan of anything spicy so this wasand ismy ideal drink
its all about the lunch lunch days a week course lunch for bucks sounds too good be true but its the real deal the service is tip top and food is fantastici woukd definitely recommend the duck confit or sea bass with cauliflower as entree and finish with the infamous chocolate molten cakeeven though its prix fix there are plenty of options and healthy portionsi cant wait to come back and do it all again
to those who have yet to experience the joy that is raclette i ask you this why the hell notto put it simply raclette is freshly melted cheese poured over some potatoes cornichon pickles and cured meats it may not sound delicious in words but trust me on this you have to try it first raclette is the size of a broom closet only a slight exaggeration seating around people only but the size of the cheese wheels and the hospitality of the servers is not to be underestimated orders of the raclette come with a refill of cheese which the server pours straight onto your plate from the hot cheese wheel which sits under heat lamps in between servings each time the server comes around with the wheel you cant help but stare and admire the chemistry that went into putting this yellow gooey deliciousness on your platehere is my recommendation for diners at raclette make a reservation did i mention this place is small grab up to seven friends bring a couple bottles of wine and simply enjoy
love uws speakeasy a gem with fantastic old school ambiance outstanding service and the best custom cocktails we were led up a back stairwell from burke and wills the australian restaurant downstairs an added bonus of dining there very cool otherwise theres another entrance ambiance old school class cricket club inspired comfortable leather sofas and chairs dark wood bookshelves with old books that if you take a close peek have the vintage feel and smell somewhat dimly lit with small candles on the tablenot crowded and seating is wonderfully arranged in personal cozy sections so whether a couple or group you will feel you have your own semi private seating area service outstanding our server april had a tasteful period look with her hair and attire she was incredible attending to the tables with confidence and a serving style that showed enthusiasm of a new employee but knowledge and confidence of an experienced server assessing what each person liked to get their best drinks witty friendly attentive and so on with her recommendationsrecommended thee perfect heavenly drink creation i cant wait to have again i was asking about their drinks a list of interesting cocktails with creative and amusing names but not sure what to get she asked about my likes i said i love mezcel and i love chocolate bam she said i have the perfect drink for you with both hmm interesting wow wow chocolate and mezcel heaven with the mixologists addition of some mexican spices apparently they have herbs and spices selected and changed regularly for the mixologistshuge five stars for the amazing service server and and mixologist jason i believe was the name she gave working at the bar last night for the perfect custom and off the menu cocktails we had as well as above and beyond outstanding service highly recommend coming here with friends a date anyone actually this is a fantastic uws gem that wont disappoint
my girlfriends and i a long overdue reunion decided on this centrally located restaurant blocks from the st stop i am not normally in this part of town as i work and live below st but this place was excellent cozy ambiance helpful waitstaff and delicious healthy mediterranean food we also used a groupon here for two people which included beer or wine appetizer and entrees i ordered a brooklyn dark lager and my friend had the white wine sangria she said the sangria was tasty one of my friends and i shared a cauliflower mezze which basically means tapa or appetizer for groupon purposes the cauliflower was one big hunk not exactly what we were both expecting it was decent but i would not get this the next time around i would suggest the eggplant or falafel or another more traditional mediterranean mezze for entrees i had the veggie patties platter served w lentils and rice and my friend ordered the shakshuka minus the optional halumi or feta cheese both of our entrees were a good size my dish was excellent and the veggie patties were so flavorful didnt need any of the accompanied sauces but the waiter was nice enough to give me both the tomato and tzatziki sauce on the side to try i was pretty hungry as i hadnt eaten much all day and biked from les to this location so i polished off my dish and was very satiated my friend finished half her entree and took the rest home our friends got a combo of mezzes for and a small mediterranean pizza they both said their meal was tasty and satisfyingfor dessert they were out of the vegan carrot cake bummer we then decided on baklava and malabi baklava were three wee small pieces very adorable presentation but the flavor was a bit lacking i would pass on this dessert our friends that had the malabi enjoyed it quite a bit so i would recommend ordering that if dairy is ok with you and with the groupon plus the dessert taxes and tip should tip the waiter off the original food price we ended up paying in total not a bad deal really this is a conveniently located proveggie mediterranean style restaurant with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere tucked in a lower level service was good and food was solid i dont think you really save that much with the groupon but its an option i definitely will be back and will also visit the west village location
this place is perfection for me not only is it a few block from home but their drinks food and service is amazing weve been here or times now and every time its a solid experience some of my favorite drinks here are the classic sazerac and pin up girl theyre a must try i would describe their food as good ol cajun cooking with an upscale twist in other words its damn good hearty food with a kick my ultimate favorite is their roast beef po boy its soooo flavorful it will leave you wanting more their fried chicken is cooked to perfection its moist and crispy and they give you dark meat also their braised collards are the best ive ever had you got to get themeverything ive ever ordered here wether it was a cocktail or a meal ive loved the restaurant itself has a very relaxed vibe but its stylish and cool they also have a great happy hour mf from on drinks and food all their staff is so friendly they go out of the way to make you feel at home this has definitely become one of my favorite places in the ues
the pennsy is a delightful new edition to the mediocrity that is midtown food choices around this area leaves one to be lack lustered yes there are enough food chains or carts around the area those who need not be named tgif im looking at you the layout of this upscale food court is easily navigable after all if your on a lunch break youd want to be in and out as fast as possible whatshesaid the space is brightly lit with modern d√©cor of cafeteria style dining thus this is easily a great location to bring a group of friends and sample different foods from each vendor by sample i mean eat till your stomachs content they have numerous restaurants including coffeebar in the back the most notable being the cinnamon snail frankly its what brought me to the pennsy in the first place the staff could not be any better from the greeters who actually seem to care to the bussers who are consistently on the job keeping the space tidy ps the cinnamon snail is a beast on its own although their menu has seen a downgrade it stills hold a prominent place in my vegan heart after all the food here is nothing short of exceptional the beast mode burger made it to the new menu and is still one of my favorites mac cheese coconut bacon and seitan patty on a pretzel bun who could ask for morepss i think my boo might kill me when he finds out i got the beast mode burger without him hahah im sure the maple bacon donut will make up for it yep lol
its tough to get tickets i got mine because of a great standby ticket number but if you get in its fantasticonline you have to have your device ready to select the tickets at the exact time he announces on twitter even that isnt a solid bet unfortunately for standby youll have to wait under the nbc marquee at a ridiculous hour but usually the top tickets have a great shot of getting into the show expect more for a major storm i think there was a major snowstorm in upstate ny on the day that i got in along with others sorry for you happy for mei honestly cant remember who the guests were when i saw the show but i didnt even care jimmy fallon is entertaining funny all on his own he probably couldve invited a and i wouldve loved itno cell phones no bathroom breaks no food or drink think about it when you watch tv do you ever see anyone in the audience enjoying a snack or texting or doing the awkward scusemewhileicrawlliterallyontopofyoutomakeittotheaisletogotothebathoom shuffle nope theyre all there to enjoy the show i dont know if ill ever crack the code of online ticketing standby was pretty exhausting but if i dont get into the audience for this again im thrilled with the experience that i did have

whoever said pizza is the ultimate drunk food i beg to differ theres honestly nothing better when youre drunk or just super hungry at than tacos with chips salsa guacamole and probably more tacosthis place is open until and also delivers ive had their regular tacos as well as the grilled fish tacos i love the grilled fish ones the best i have also made the mistake of getting a grilled fish burrito once it was delicious but honestly no one needs that amount of food at such late hours the salsa is super spicy and they give you a lot for the order more than most places give which also comes with a large box of chips
review on yelp and it just happens to be on of my fav places in the city to grab a quick bite why you as ask they are always consistent i order from them pretty often because i work in soho and regardless if i do pickup or delivery via grubhub i always receive it on time and food is always correct when i say always i mean always the food always taste fresh and well seasoned lunch time is definitely their busiest time of the day and along with late nights as wellmy favorite food at this fine establishment chicken tortilla soup any of the tacos chicken sandwichpick any of those three and you will be a believer and lover of la esquina during the spring and summer they have outside seating if you are lucky and there is seating inside but it is extremely limited if you come during lunch without calling ahead you will be waiting a good minutes to get food but trust me it is well worth the waiti have been to the lounge downstairs twice and i have thoroughly enjoyed myself on both occasions it is rumored that is one of beyonces favorite spots the menu is alot larger then they have upstairs the corn is to die for the selection of mezcals and tequilas is out of this world stop reading this review and just go you will thank me later
when you are craving pizza in the big bad city and dont want to brave the black ice and the crowded trains winter coats add volume to the commuting population to take you to di fara in faraway brooklyn you will find a contemporary pizzeria in marta in the madison square park areamarta boasts of danny meyer pedigree and is an ecosystem that also includes the martha washington hotel and a sizeable bar that doubles up as a waiting area for the restaurant just the other day i went with a good friend and former colleague who lives in the area and the experience was flawlesshigh ceilings a communal feel great service and especially good cracklycrusted pizza what more can you ask for the mezzanine area lent itself to quiet conversation we discussed work gossiped about common friends plotted a few clever moves and then agreed to catch up again soon i consumed a pizza and a half and most of the ricottahazelnut appetizeri will return to marta soon not so much to experience the diversity of the menu as to simply indulge in what i like mostgreat thincrust pizza hopefully i will have equally delightful company for my future trips

we often say love cannot last forever and yet what is forever to us there isnt a single aspect of our lives that exists in perpetuity not ourselves not our homes not even the art we create which will likely disappear long before the sun swallows the earthi personally think it isnt the great cathedrals or statues or gods that are eternal for us rather it is the most fleeting things that kiss you will always remember the look on your sons face you think of every day an accident you wish you could changeit is these infinitely small transient things that are the true monuments of life that stay with us always so if you are sitting here with someone you care about sipping an espresso for a few minutes know that you are making a greater and more true history than anything read in any book and honestly the espresso pulled here which is some of the best on the uws is well worth making these kinds of moments i often think how sad and sorry a thing like a government or even an entire city is compared to two people sitting in the corner of some coffee shop sharing the briefest of kisses
this place is basically a little haven for sushi deliciousness no frills when it comes to the exterior and upstairs it is very simple and clean with impeccable service chef is always impressive he is masterful in his craft and it shows do the omakase and let him showcase his talent everything is beyond fresh here they might as well have just brought it in from the ocean before you sat down also always love the sake here
its a rarity to find a lunch spot in midtown where you can actually eat fresh and healthy food if healthy and delicious is what youre looking for then you should check this place out but dont come here too often because i dont want to stand in a long line i think the name between the bread is an oxymoron because most of their menu focuse on salads and bowls and not sandwiches you choose your protein and then pick two sides the proteins include grilled or herbgrilled chicken salmon catch of the day or shrimp the salmon looked great but on this particular day i chose the catch of the day which was a beautifully cooked white fish sides include roasted pumpkin brussels sprouts fire roasted cauliflower beet salad and kale grains include wild rice couscous or quinoa i went with the kale and beet salad both were delicious and healthy portions are not too large but just enough prices are not bad either id happily pay more to eat healthy everyday very little seating here so most likely youll have to do take out
overall an outstanding dining experiencei wanted to do something special for the lady to celebrate the holidays we have dined at many upscale restaurants in nyc and per se was next on my list i called the reservationist two months in advance to ensure a table at a reasonable hour given the restaurants longstanding reputation and high accolades you are required to provide a credit card to secure a reservation and their cancellation fee is per guest if you do not notify the restaurant within days of your reservation date they also enforce a dress code which requires jackets long pants no jeans and no tennis shoes for men and no shorts or tennis shoes for women we dined at the restaurant last night and i wore a suit while my girlfriend wore a dress we were not overdressedthe restaurant was elegant walk through the large blue doors on the fourth floor of the time warner center to find the hosts and a classy salon we were greeted promptly and escorted to the dining room which was beautiful the d√©cor and table arrangements were upscale and the room featured a fireplace and unobstructed views of columbus circle and central parkthe service was excellent all of our servers were approachable we appreciated their willingness to accommodate any of our requests they were extremely knowledgeable of the menus and they even took the time to get to know us on a more personal level the presentation of our drinks and food courses was professionalthe drinks were great the restaurants wine cocktail alcoholic and nonalcoholic menu is roughly pages they also allow guests to bring wines that are not represented on their list for a fee of per bottle my girlfriend ordered their version of a gin tonic which she found to be refreshing i started with a blood and sand including a mixture of johnnie walker blue cherry heering and carpano sweet vermouth which was very tasteful i capped the meal with a single malt scotch which was a glenrothes from the macphails collection this was served with a small and single cube thanks to the recommendation from our waiter and it was outstandingthe food was delicious they offer two daily menus which are a vegetable tasting menu and the chefs tasting menu we both ordered the chefs tasting menu without any supplements this included two starter courses seven menu courses and an assortment of desserts we enjoyed every course with the oysters and pearls fillet of mediterranean lubina maine sea scallop and pekin duck breast as some of our favorites another notable course was the beef short rib which was braised for hours their description of an assortment of desserts is an understatement we were served at least four different desserts including a box of truffles that were made onsite which my girlfriends sweet tooth thoroughly appreciatedwe had a great time and concurred that this was one of our more enjoyable fine dining experiences we look forward to coming back again soon
ok this is where the big boys and girls eatas good as it gets for experience ambience and foodthe bar and dining room are perfectly lit the staff are just there but not overly fussy and food aside this place feels special on a higher level to pretty much else anything else ive tried in new yorkthe fact that the food is simply delicious mouth wateringly so cements an easy star reviewi normally wait before posting a review to see how i felt about an experience on reflection no need here the greek is quite simply the nicest overall dining experience ive had in new york citytake a step of those tribeca cobbled streets and get inside i can honestly promise you will not regret it fantastic
the quick from start to finish a five star very expensive and noteworthy experience the service is amazing the atmosphere is casual and inviting and the sushi with sake pairing is what dreams are made ofthe details i wish i could afford sushi nakazawa regularly because i fear i am ruined for all other sushi the food was out of this world its roughly courses with all different types of fish hand curated perfectly for consumption even the homemade pickled ginger it was delicious no soy sauce or extra wasabi needed the meal really was an experience interacting with the chefs the whole evening was sort of like a show you must sit at the sushi bar or its not worth the expense note the staff is extremely fancy but patrons can wear jeans its a nice mix pro tip if youre a couple i recommend people splitting the sake pairing the pours were very generous and one person would likely leave wasted if thats your goal by all means live your life the damage person for omakase with the sake pairing the bill was before tip and we already want to go back
some friends and i recently went to have a wonderful feast on a thursday evening at about on a cold night right off a cobble stone street in the meatpacking district i arrived to a warm welcome at bagatelle before i even reached the bar to wait for the rest of my party to arrive i encountered five different employees all greeting me with huge beautiful bright smilesthe restaurant that happened to be the setting for our evening was what might be considered the birth child of when classy got with hip or perhaps a better description it was the result of when a bunch of undercover hip people including the staff showed up at a classy restaurant this all became very evident reaching the point of being unmistakable as soon as i laid eyes on the cool suggestive artwork donned by the walls then again the restaurant might have described itself best the chic st tropez meets paris this place is legendary for its epic partylike brunches but now can also be touted for its great food with the masterpieces from chef s√©bastienonce my entire party of arrived we commenced with our communal style meal with appetizers and wine at about pm we started with salad grilled octopus homemade gnocchi black truffle pizza ahi tuna tartar king crab leg and main diver scallops like myself the entire group enjoyed everything but i also had a few personal favorites of my owngrilled octopus aka poulpe grill√© √† la planchawhite bean hummus crispy yukon gold kalamata olives aioliwas juicy tender and flavorful suddenly i dont know if i can ever look at ursula off the little mermaid the same way again where you may see evil i see potential a lot of delicious potential whoever thought octopus could taste this goodhomemade gnocchi aka gnocchi truff√©s √† la parisienne de nicolasblack truffle pesto filling truffle saucewas perfectly cooked with an excellent texture and by far the best i have ever had thought to originate in the middle east whomever first created gnocchi would be very pleased with what has come of it at least the gnocchi i hadblack truffle pizza aka pizza √† la truffle noireblack truffle flat bread cr√®me fraiche scamozawas extremely flavorful decadent in a good way but also well balanced to even call something that taste so unique but still so good pizza seems blasphemous yeah i was lucky enough to have two slices due to everyone elses efforts to king crab leg aka ceviche de crabe dalaskaking crab leg habanero citrus leche de tigre smoked trout roewas remarkable as the sweet flavors of crab danced with acidic citrus and lightly spicy habanero this was a threesome i am fully willing to stand behind anytime if it looks like thisafter our light and not so light apps the more hearty heavy hitters came out we had wholetruffle chicken center cut beef tenderloin and pan seared marinated hudson valley duck breast of the three i enjoyed the ch√¢teaubriand pour deux best oz center cut beef tenderloin truffle potato pur√©e red wine and peppercorn sauce for two the truffle potato pur√©e might have been the best mashed potatoes ive ever had they were thick and richly flavorful not really sure what else i should say about them i will just add this though immediately i formed a gripe towards every other establishment ive ever had truffle anything from every single thing chef s√©bastien put truffles in or on that we ate was simple amazing hell i didnt even think i cared that much for truffles before bagatelle up until this point ive been cheated of great truffle experiences and someone owes me answersnext came the desserts we had italian meringue crisp white chocolate tart dark chocolate mousse and caramelized hazelnut mini choux puffdrops spoon the chouchou caramel though wow caramelized hazelnut mini choux puff and milk chocolate caramel sauce was incredible on your visit you should tell your server sheldon sent you then ask for it because it isnt on the menu okay that will most likely increase your chances of getting the chouchou by but it sounded good hahacenturies after spices and food from around the world was made available to the rest of the world a mad scientist figured out how to pair these ingredients together perfectly chef s√©bastien is an evil genius with a life goal of dooming everyone who is fortunate enough to partake in his delicious creations he wants to doom us to eternal gluttony im convinced of it and cant wait to partake again
so who grew up the bronx and didnt take a school trip here probably no one okay maybe someone but odds are if you live in nyc or the surrounding areas youve been here at least once the bronx zoo is deeply intertwined with the history of the borough itself opened in the zoo is owned by the wildlife conservation society wcs does work all around the world and they also ownoperate four other nyc parks central park zoo queens zoo prospect park zoo and the new york aquarium at acres the bronx zoo is the largest park wcs runs and is also the location of their headquarters theres a lot to see and do you definitely get your moneys worth with the amount of animals youll see they have a good representation of most types of wildlife some of my favorite exhibits are jungle world congo gorilla forest the sea lion pool and the sea bird aviary its a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes though they have a shuttle that goes from one side of the zoo to the other which i believe they charge for food options are okay there are concession stands throughout the park and a large counter service eatery called the dancing crane cafe located in the center of the zoo for something less runofthemill i would bring my own foodsnacks theres also a large gift shop in the center of the park where you can pick up your bronx zoo memorabilia and a stuffed snake the zoo is pretty accessible there are four entrances and four parking lots they charge for parking additionally its not a far walk from the subways metro north and city buses wednesday is suggested donation aka free day though you may be tempted the crowds are crazy so i would avoid it admission isnt exactly cheap but its worth it the bronx zoo is definitely a place to visit at least once definitely makes other zoos pale in comparison
reservation recommended unless you want to wait hoursprobably my new favorite place for ayce hot pot but the wait here as with most hot pot places is absolutely ridiculous however if youre like me and the craving for hot pot is just so real and you called and they already had reservations left a hour wait is worth it was it worth it verdict yesafter the crazy long wait we were finally seated at our table but we only had you have the choice of having large pot split into or to share among the table but we decided to each get our own individual pots instead free of charge you can choose from original herbal spicy curry or tom yum soup basesof course i went with the spicy soup base as i do with all hot pot places it was just i expected spicy but not too bad and actually not ridiculously greasy like some places have it there were plenty of numbing herbs and whole garlic cloves as wellthe ingredients at hometown seem very fresh from the watercress to the seafood to the meat i highly recommend the lamb it was really good here and i usually dont eat that much meat when i eat hot pot watercress is my absolute favorite no comment on the rest of the ingredients its just really what you prefer to eat or not eat just know that its freshservice is much much better than that of favor our waiter was all smiles and really nice i also liked that there seems to be much more space to move around here and not feel like youre eating in a box with a million other people sitting too close to you the decor is modern and quite comfortable both upstairs and downstairscurrent ranking of chinatown hot pot hou yithey charge a pound for uneaten food but im not sure its really enforcedventilation is not that great in the downstairs area beware you will smell after leaving the restaurantgood for groups as they have massive tables downstairs but definitely make a reservation
i have a long history with scarpetta when i was a young deer in headlights at years old a little baby fawn in my first year of ever living in manhattan i came here for dinner with some friends there is no sign in front of the restaurant and i completely forgot the namewhere this restaurant was i always did remember it as the best spaghetti i ever hadfast forward to when i moved to miami and dined at scarpetta where this glorious spaghetti again touched my mouth i instantly remembered the flavors as being from the same restaurant in nyc i finally realized that it was scarpetta that i had dined with that lovely eveningever since then i have been to the scarpetta in la vegas miami and back in nyc i have never had a negative experience at all in this restaurant ever that is pretty hard to pull off the food is extremely consistent and absolutely delicious raw yellowtail light and refreshing although i wish there was some ponzu sauce or a bit more flavor to it thats just my opinion a lot of people like it the more traditional way with less sauces chilled corn soup i was never a fan of cold soup until having this dish at scarpetta it changed the game and now i love chilled soups it has the perfect texture and flavor its not too heavy but not too light either scallops amazing but you only get so be prepared it is a smaller dish spaghetti to die for period duck foie gras ravioli awesome dish but very very rich heavenly theres nothing else i can really say about scarpetta other than consuming all the carbs here is actually worth it and i dont say that about many italian restaurants yum
dropped in on ramen lab last friday and as you know they consistently host a cadre of formidable talent from japan that take up residency at this famed yet tiny establishment to showcase different styles of ramen theyve got our in the bag and heres whyquality ramen in the us supplied by sun noodles goes pretty much hand in hand with every great establishment in new york its no secret that ramen lab would lead the forefront of this charge from when they first opened with chef jack nakamura operating and setting the tone for others to followi met up with three others around as theres no reservations you write your name down on a board by the door entrance within the vestibule the wait time lasted for no more than a half hour decent given the time we showed up if you arrived an hour earlier theres probably little to no wait at all their choices are listed on the wall and theres little in the way of ambiguity of decisionmaking which makes ordertaking simple efficient and straightforward that part happens when they call your name to enter its standing room only as can be expected and cash onlythis season ramen tetsuya from sapporo japan holds residency the same tetsuya brothers ramen known to specialize in shoyu oddly they offered miso tonkotsu here and serve it particularly well i was not decidedly hungry so i ordered a regular my friend ordered one with the seasoned eggthe ramen arrived lightning fast well within minutes of entering and we were able to snap photos yet still have steaming hot ramen awaiting us after ten minutes of photosnapping obnoxious funthere were a couple pieces of decent sized chashu sitting above the broth but the broth is what made the meal in addition to the nice chew from the ramen noodles i nearly finished the broth it was that good its no secret that other restaurants may offer an extra side of noodles so you can finish it along with the broth but that is not an option hereas the staff here were very professional and worked quickly there were no complaints to be had other than the familiar waiting period and that there were no seats to be found except a couple of makeshift ones outside by the vestibule beyond that theyve earned their stars
dinner was absolutely fantastic made a reservation for a thursday night about a week early and had no problem getting a table i love the ambiance of the place you can tell its been around for a long time the wait staff is extremely nice and attentive the oysters were delicious and fresh the steak au poivre was perfection i got it cooked medium rare and it was spot on the peppercorn crust and sauce give it an incredible flavor the spinach and fries that come with it are also delicious the lamb was tasty and cooked perfectly but couldve used a little more flavor the profiteroles were insane you have to get these they look dense but theyre light and airy and the chocolate sauce is insane i found myself eating it straight from the gravy boat this isnt a cheap place for dinner but for a celebration as was mine its a great spot that everyone will enjoy
the best thing about having friends visit from out of town is taking them to all of the places i normally wouldnt make it to er other than seeing the friends themselves levain was at the top of my list because unlike other new york heavyweights looking at you shake shack and momofuku they havent felt the need to spawn and spread themselves too thin having seen the crazy lines at the location i decided to chance the fredrick douglass one and there was a line yep i was stuffed from a winner winner chicken lunch at pio pio a few hours before but after watching my friend wolf down the chocolate chip walnut cookie i knew i was in for a treat the cookie was still gooey and chewy even after sitting out on the counter for a few hours so good id even be willing to try the oatmeal raisin version shaped like a scone a little dome of nutschips at the top a perfectly crunchy ring and best of the best the molten middle i have to confess i dont understand most of the food that people go insane for hours for ramen waking up early for a cronut paying out of the nose for avocado toast with some chili flakes feta and pumpkin seeds guilty and ive been making my own avocado toast since but this cookie deserves the hype next time dark chocolate and pb cookie i love peanut butter in any kind of dessert form so im a little terrified at how gross i will look eating it but its a sacrifice that im willing to make
found my new fave dinner spot came here for mistress valentines a joke by the hubby because we couldnt get a table for actual valentines day so we opted for a substitute celebration whatever valentines schmalentines hate to ascribe to it it had been awhile for us in manhattan where everything from taste quality service synced beautifully together to create that perfect dining experience but it happened here service was phenomenal from the minute we stepped into this place til the moment we left the set menus plating and ambiance really made us feel like we were truly dining in japan also was great seeing a lot of japanese people dining here as well to me that is the true mark of awesome japanese farewe started with the handmade soba noodles with dipping sauces to start and it was just perfect sooo good i forced the hubby okay gently directed him to order the kaisen don set which he didnt really like but that uni yes it is as sweet and umamitasting as everyone has described i would order that separately but thats just me my katsu toji katsu fried pork loin in salty sweet soy broth was definitely the star of the meal my hubby couldnt keep his chopsticks away from it with the set it comes with pickled vegetables ok pork and vegetable miso broth hubby really loves this steamed egg custard yummy unless youre like my hubs who actually thought he was getting ice cream custard and yes that heaping bowl of rice theres also the option of ordering soba and addons for an extra price which had we known wouldve done that instead of getting the soba as a starter even though we were both stuffed midway into our meal we just had to finish off with dessert ordered the strawberry parfait which contained buttermilk mmmm and strawberry ice cream with a powdered sugar cone strawberry sauce and marshmallows these really kinda took away from it all if you ask me paired all this with hot yuzu sake and a pitcher of sapporo which we realized was just excessive at this point given how much food they give you i havent been able to stop thinking about this place and cant wait to come back again all in all a great traditional japanese spot with options of getting sashimisushi yakitori dinner sets or churashi i highly highly recommend this place
ill up it to for the extra friendly servicegot one dark peanut butter cup with sea salt for it was absolutely delicious like melted peanut butter inside and the sea salt really added to the flavorgreat hot chocolate not soupy or too rich like city bakery and definitely better than la maisons for bucks at bucks definitely one i would return forand one of their small chocolates
a few small issues but rounding up because the food and wine were out of this world like actually im not sure if these things were created by earthlings order of the spicy tuna plates and maybe of the beef tartares okay maybe just come here for dinner every night and deal with the whole going broke thing later sound reasoning nocame here around on a thursday night as others have reported theres going to be a pretty substantial wait if you dont come between no reservations the hostess was incredibly scattered which was one of the minor issues we experienced during our visit im not sure if she was overwhelmed or what but there seemed to be no organization whatsoever when it came to seating people efficiently so while our first impression wasnt good we were determined to stick it out thank god we did the wait ended up being about minutes they told us but we were rewarded for good behavior being sat right in front of the kitchen some might prefer a table but my fellow foodie friend and i were thrilledjust to clarify when i say foodie im not one of those voracious timeseatergrub streetinfatuation readers who knows everything about every restaurant opened by this team or that team or the brainchild of the creators of so and so what i did know going into it was this i had been wanting to try the tasting menu at contra for quite some time and when i heard that wildair was the more causal wait for it brainchild of the contra folks and a la carte to boot it shot up to the top of my list first wine i know cocktails very well beer pretty well and wine not well at all so when im confronted with a wine list such as the colossal display at wildair i get really intimidated thankfully there were plenty of servers around to help guide us in the right direction and all of them were quite patient with our amateurism i ended up trying two different reds which were both fantastic we both opted for wine by the glass so we were able to give our prospective options a taste before deciding the wine here along with being overwhelmingly diverse is naturalorganicbiodynamic so like the food the feel is very clean and refined food the way that everything is listed on the menu youd think the food here is oddly minimalist this is not the case they list the key players in each dish but the subtleties are left a mystery im a fan bread and olive oil apaying for bread seems silly to me but theyre known for making some standout bread inhouse here and the rumors are true the only thing silly here would be not to order it not much more to say you gotta experience it yourself beef tartare smoked cheddar chestnuts ai dont eat red meat too often but after perusing the yelp and the google for a bit before coming here it seemed pretty unanimous that ordering the beef tartare at wildair might be the best decision you make all day again the hype was warranted the texture and flavor profiles of this dish were sublime the tuna was my favorite dish of the meal but my inner foodie knows this baby was by far the most inventive and beautifullyexecuted plate we had apparently beef can be made light and fluffy thank you wildair for enlightening me just a note this plate is slightly spicy thanks to the addition of some horseradish this made the dish for megeorgia white shrimp celery cilantro ayoure encouraged to eat the skin its not necessary but it made the dish for me i wasnt head over heels in love with the shrimp honestly but it was masterfully prepared as everything here seems to be spicy tuna scallion tomatoes aserved on toast party in your mouth good i suppose its not as refined as some of the other dishes here and certainly not as complex but the resounding flavor is incredibly powerful the tomato and tuna blend together in the sweetest of harmonies now thats what i call a power couplechocolate hazelnut tart a i basically dont eat desserts because consuming food high in sugar does really weird stuff to my chemistry that said i caved and had a couple bites of the tart after hearing nothing but squeals of glee from my equally adventurous dining companion they were warranted i assure you the tart looks quite simple deceptively simple i dont know how they make this little piece of heaven taste so damn good the salt on top doesnt hurt but whatever they do they better keep doing it sweet rich creamy but not too heavy
hale and hearty please open a store in the bronx no not just in the bronx but specifically in throggs neck okayi confess i am a soup lover i kid you not i could have soup days a year but only with one caveat there has to be a multitude of varieties and thats what hale and hearty provides a multitude of varieties aside from soups hale and hearty offers a choice of premade sandwiches plus an option to createyourown salad eh for me id rather just have my soup thank you very much thank you executive chef bruce rogers for bringing your philosophy of if you liked it as a kid youll like it as a soup basically it seems his thought process is any knife and fork meal could be basically turned into a soup and did so by creating different varieties that are constantly rotating on the menu boardto help you choose theres a dietary breakdown showing either vvegetarian llowfat or ddairy plus samples are offered to also narrow down your decision samples have helped me expand my favorites to curried eggplant lentil ginger butternut squash chicken pot pie tomato cheddaryummm tomato cheddar lobster bisque vegetarian split pea green yellow split pea with smoked bacon morrocan chicken and so many more this location during lunch hours can have lines out the door but the employees at the soup counter and the register are good at what they do and get you in and out quick fast and in a hurry upon checkout dont forget to get your green bean card stamped so you can cashin on a free soup after a bunch of visits soup is good food
after seeing these guys at countless pop up food festivals madison square eats broadway bites etc how fortunate we were to have them open up their only permanent storefront literally right across the street from usas much as you may want to customize your best bet is to stick with their prearranged signature options my favorites are the banh mi braised pulled pork or chicken w spicy aioli vinegar slaw fried shallots cilantro sandwich and the buffalo mac cheese side if youre indecisive youre better off getting two half sandwiches over a full one youll pay an extra buck or two overallnot only can you pick out two varieties but youll actually end up with something more substantial in sizefilling than a full sandwich
it isnt often you get to say that you had a restaurant experience that was perfect from beginning to end but my experience at ocean prime was one of them i was meeting a group for a birthday dinner but i arrived early this allowed me to spend some time at the bar enjoying a couple drinks beforehand the hostess was immediately welcoming and after a quick coat check i hung out at the bar to enjoy my cocktail i had the whiskey clover described on the menu as gentleman jack whiskey hennessy vs honey waterhandsqueezed lemon orange youd think with a description like that the drink wouldve been overly sweet but instead it was just the right balance of citrus sweetness and whiskey flavor i really enjoyed itas i sat at the bar i looked around the bar area which includes several comfortable circular booths and tall tables the bar area alone could accommodate a party the decor manages the hat trick of looking sophisticated but not pretentious the combination of dark wood white counters medium tone furniture and dim lighting creates a comfortable atmosphere that feels rich but not in an off putting manner the environment lends itself to everything from after work drinks with colleagues to a dateeventually my friends began to arrive and we all got to talking so much so we didnt realize that it was taking a rather long time to get to our table we had a reservation i highly recommend you make one the manager came up to us and was very gracious offering us the use of the private dining room near the bar area dubbed the rockefeller room since they had made us wait so long we of course accepted and happily sat down for a very different experience than we had expectedthe rockefeller room could easily accommodate a small office party of about people there is a large round table with a huge lazy susan in the middle there is a flat screen tv mounted on the wall and tasteful decor is the order of the day in the brightly lit room our waiter was absolutely professional and on point the entire night it wasnt just a matter of making sure our glasses were full of water his manner and event he way he addressed us spoke volumes about the training the staff had gone through we were all very impressedokay enough talk about the room and bar etc what did i eat heres a list of what i got to havefilet mignonnot wanting to be a complete glutton i went with the filet mignon medium rare the steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly while you can order items on top of the steak such as black truffle butter i wanted it straight to taste it in its most pure form im really glad i did when i cut the meat it was like butter and it was perfectly tender there was just the right amount of seasoning to make your taste buds happy but not overwhelm them it was also truly medium rare with pink in the middlejalapeno au gratina side dish this comes in a rather large bowl and there was enough that all six people at the dinner were able to get a couple forkfuls of this spicy dish jalapenos generally can go two ways either there is a kick or there isnt in this dish there definitely was along with some savory flavorparmesan truffle friesother restaurants have this and ive had it many times most of the time they are shoestring fries and theres not a lot of substance to them not so here these fries were huge and the cheese layer was obvious from several feet away these were absolutely addicting be warned you cant just eat a couplecreamed spinachwhat could have been a typical creamed spinach is elevated by a smokey element inside the dish most of us agreed it was likely bacon but there were no bacon bits to be found whatever the case may be this was a very uncommon creamed spinach that was full of flavorblack truffle mac n cheesei only got to have one bite of this but it was full of flavor the cheese was creamy and salty and the truffle flavor was definitely assertive ten layer carrot cakea signature dessert this cake was truly layers it was a literal tower of goodness the cake was so moist that you could push a fork through all ten layers and it didnt tip over it tasted delicious and surprisingly had no raisins in itchocolate peanut butter piepeanut butter mousse and bittersweet chocolate ganache come together to make one of the most delicious desserts ive had in ages the mousse is perfectly delicate but full of flavor while the ganache gives just the right amount of sweetness to balance the savory mousse special shout out to the coffee and bread basket both of which could easily be overlooked in any restaurant but here they were exceptional the bread basket had amazing pretzel sticks fresh baked and the coffee was french pressedi really enjoyed my experience at ocean prime and i cant wait to go back
i thought i should wait a bit to go here but i wanted to see what all the hype was about also my friend lives right down the block so i figured if we had a long wait we could at least wait there i went yesterday wednesday and got there around the line was to the corner of and so not that bad they opens at so they were seating people slowly and then when they were filled they would take names luckily both my friend and i were there and we were seated when we got up to the front it was probably overall a min wait the place is a good size we were seated in the front at one of the low communal tables there are seats at each of those tables and we were sat in the middle across from each other it was close you could hear everyones conversation around you but i didnt feel like they were eating right on top of me the place was noisy though so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation the waitress came over and took our drink orders i just went with a glass of the house white it was sweeter than i thought it would be but it was still good my friend had ordered the limoncello slushi but they came back and told us it wasnt ready yet so he went with the blood orange daquiri we had looked over the food menu and thought about what we had wanted we also heard a few recommendations from the waitress and then made our decisions we decided to go with small plates and no entr√©e and it proved to be a good idea we ordered the sirloin crudo ive never been a big fan of tartare or carpaccio i like my fish raw not my meat but my friend wanted to try it and it was a suggested plate to get so we did it was pretty good and i had some but i let my friend finish it if you like raw meat i think youd like it we didnt add on truffles to anything because i hate them but for an additional price you could add it this and the chicken and dumplings soup we got the shaved winter vegetables which are pickeled and served in a beef broth i liked it the presentation was pretty and it was light and refreshing another one from the appetizer section we got was the tofu i really liked this one the tofu was so smooth and creamy the trout roe on top was really fishy tasting but i liked it i finished that one off while my friend finished off the crudo winwin next up was the ceci e pepe which was probably one of my favorites the pasta was so good and chickpea hozon whatever that it was amazing im not a huge black pepper person but i even enjoyed that on top too last up we got the chicken and dumplings i really liked this as well my friend wasnt as big of a fan it was served in a thick broth with chicken thick noodles and mushrooms which i did not eat and had a bit of a spicy kick to it we thought about dessert but we were both stuffed so maybe next time overall i really enjoyed nishi everything we ordered was really good my friend doesnt love fish so there were a few dishes id like to go back another time and try service was good everyone seemed very friendly and attentive clearing plates and making sure everything was ok pricewise i didnt think it was too bad either for a drink and a satisfying meal it came to about per person no tipping its all included which isnt crazy for a nice meal in nyc i definitely plan to go back at some point

this is by far one of the best indian restaurants ive visited time and time again they never disappoint whether we come for the lunch buffet or a la carte the staff is always pleasant and attentive the bathrooms are always clean and weve never had a problem getting a table the lunch buffet has a wonderful selection of various curry dishes vegetable dishes and tandoori the price is right at on weekdays and on weekends they usually have one or two desserts my favourites being the halwa carrot pudding gulab jamun sweet dumplings and the kheer rice pudding every time we visit we leave full and satisfied their samosas have gotten much better since i last remember the dough is way lighter so you can actually enjoy the whole thing without becoming overly full their naan is always good its soft and warm and i love getting the garlic variety every meal comes with papadum thin baked bread crisp and a few condiments of tamarind sauce onions and a cilantro sauce i love their curries both phaal and vindaloo are my favourites and i usually pick either lamb goat or shrimp as my protein theyre extremely spicy but an order of raita will help cool it down the biriyani is top notch as is their tandoori chicken unbelievably juicy if youre feeling adventurous try some of their hot pickle condiment which is basically spicy pickled lime just writing about it makes my mouth water i would suggest that you take advantage of their buffet if you havent visited before so you get the opportunity to try a variety of items weekdays are less crowded bit get there early because there tends to be a steady flow of people throughout their lunch rush also make sure to fill out a comment card so that you stay alert with their events and specials

for every fast sushi places in nyc there is a sushi yasaka its not that any one detail is worth its own entry in ny magrather care and a careful eye are given to everything herethe values look like other places but dont let for three maki rolls miso soup and salad lull you into low expectations i already told you everything is better than you expect feel free to hope for friendly service quick water refills fresh hot tea and highgrade fish in those rolls unsurprisingly sushi yasaka is also pretty busy but they manage their wait times efficiently even on packed weekday lunchtimes
this place lives up to the hype and dominique ansel is a pure genius the only thing that annoys me is that things like the cronut and the cookie shot are served at certain times but thats probably better for the diabetes epidemic i had a friend come in for a day and i decided this was the most touristy things to do and i have never been here the bakery itself is very narrow and long so make sure not to bring something big with you there were some people that came with suitcases which made it a pain to walk around in the back theres a beautiful garden and on the way to the garden you can see the employees baking and like sticks of butter i have never seen so much butter in my life since i didnt know the cronut was a morning thing we ordered the dka the dka was delicious and was perfectly caramelized outer crust and was puffy and layered that bounced back after i bit into it loved it i was kinda mad that i forgot that they sold frozen smores which would have been to cool to get with my friend in town we then hung around till to get on the cookie shot line the line wasnt that bad for a friday we prob waited like mins max a few people go in at a time as to not crowd the bakery omg the cookie shot it is pure perfection we couldnt talk for like mins after and kept rubbing our bellies it was amazing the cookie was dense and chewy just the way i like it writing this review is making crave carbs really bad and want to preorder like million cronuts so im gonna stop now

great new bar where the mediocre neelys bbq used to be terrific beer list cocktails ambiance food ping pong tables pinball machines popcorn machine and flat screens all around holy cow a working fireplace tooplenty of seating along the bar high tops with stools and heavy picnic benches that seats couples or groupsvaried menu with a little something on it for everyone brats sandwiches finger foods salads and some main course entrees i found the prices fair for the area and for the type of craft beers curated on their list but may seem a bit pricey for rotating draught craft beers and ciders and a selection in bottles cask beer and hand crafted artisanal cocktails so there is a lot to choose from hot damn a few of us enjoyed a terrific smoked chipotle cherry milk porter while i decided on a refreshing ipa and pilsner so much beer lovethe cigar bar is still downstairs on the level below so if you want a puff on a stogie after a few brews the option is close by bathroom is down on that level toooh yeah get the monster sized pretzel huge soft hot sexy youre welcomeloved the look and feel of this bar as there is nothing else like it in the area fun vibe and friendly staff wonderful new spot on the ues to get your brews on

another excellent display of just how much the bronx has changed this time we are going to take a look at this wonderful hotel called umbrella hotel ill break down in a few parts to just why this hotel stands out from the rest in the bronxthe grounds this hotel is located in the melrose section of the bronx it truly stands tall and proud displaying wonderful inviting lights wanting for people to try this place thats what attracted this to me as i was trying to find a suitable hotel for my friends who were in town for a few days so i decided to checkin like any yelp pro would do and snoop around this placethe inside as i walked inside i was quickly acknowledged and greeted with respect i gotta say i was almost taken back by the the wonderful gesture it was as almost i wasnt in the bronx it was a simple hello welcome to umbrella hotel how may i help you today and of course with a smile that had me sold on putting my friends in here for the next day so i wanted to check out the rooms before i made any decisions so i decided to do my investigation of the area and i must say i was true impressed on everything i sawfloor by floor literally i peeked into a few finished rooms and i noticed the tvs were huge tvskings size beds with lavish bedding to accommodate along with it even the bathrooms were in excellent condition i judge harshly on bathrooms being a certain way but i was impressedoverall i ended up recommending my friends from out of town stayed here not only they saved month from not going to the city they were able to have that luxurious feel and be in the bronx so to umbrella way to represent and show the bronx is making statements
moving is such a drag it takes weeks makes you ask a ton of your friends and of your relationship with your significant other and for what well i guess for a place like this in this particular case my move however painful miss you already brooklyn paid me back with a few perks when i first heard that we would be seeing a place next to central park i figured it would be nice who doesnt love a walk in the park but nothing overly insane i mean a park is a park right wrong oh so very wrong of an assumption some parks are well better than others and the conservatory is amazing walking through vanderbilt gate a guy actually unlocks this in the morning i want to see what the key looks like you find yourself transported to a park hidden inside a park with flowing fountains and groomed walking paths the park is sculptured with angles and elevations that are laid out so spectacularly that they make this oasis in manhattan feel truly grand this place would do very well in paris no doubt about it the best part of this park for me is that it takes you out of the craziness of the city to a more tranquil place you can truly relax here and forget about your surroundings or the stress of the day if youve never had a chance to check this place out and happened to find yourself in the north side of the park absolutely stop inside note its good to be back new lab is up and running apartment is coming together and i actually have a few minutes to write a review hurray
ill keep this short and simple so you can save time reading my review and get that rearend in gear on over to om the dishes are superb they have a separate part of the menu for vegetarian and most things can be made vegan if not already although they serve wine and beer inhouse they still offer byob with no corkage fee including bottle service from monthurs only so note friday sunday theres a fee still the best deal since sliced breadnear major transportation prices are cheap and service is outstandingthey did not bat an eye when jennifer spilled two glasses of wine and water all over the table and floor nor did they mind when she spilled food on the floor at the new table what did i get myself into here they remained courteous and polite offering outstanding service despite thrillas best attempts to violently overthrow the establishment in a foodfightfrenzy
haha yeah the chicken sandwich here is amazing i mean i ate at fuku literally ago and i liked the one here slightly more and yeah you have to put in some time waiting for your bird but once it finally comes you will see that it is pretty excellentjust before being placed into the sandwich the fried chicken is slathered in this spicy vinegary dip that gives it this really unique tangy flavor it is also slightly spicier than most chicken sandwiches currently in nyc but not overwhelming however the spicy dip also dampens the skin a bit so just be aware of that but with the pickles crazy southern mayo and straight up normcore bun it is a pretty insane sandwich and probably one of the top fried chicken sandwiches in nyc right nowi also found the fried chicken here to be both comically large and quite excellent i like the shatteringly thin puffy golden skin as well as the extremely moist meat and ever so slightly spicy taste i also tried the potato salad which was really herbaceous and enjoyableas for all the people giving star because they had to wait mins guys welcome to nyc
i cant love this place more unfortunately it has turned me away from regular ol storebought yogurt and taken a huge bite out of my wallet recently like any other yogurtlovin gal i was all about the fage until i discovered the delicious freshmade yogurt at greecologiesyou get two yogurt options strained or traditional while strained is more similar to your typical greek yogurt i prefer the traditional it has a thin layer of whey on top and i like that its less thick but just as creamy to me the traditional has a bit more flavor and is much less tart if you go with the rose petal preserves be prepared to try nothing else for as long as you live i thought i would be adventurous with the menu each time i walk in but ive not been able to wean myself off the rose petal preserves just do it its a magical combination and best of all you can buy a jar of the rose petals to add to your own yogurt at homethere are plenty of savory items on the menu ive had the greek salad which is superb all of their ingredients taste great and look like they belong on a blog the service is topnotch and the space is big and comfortable theres a garden in the back and plenty of seats because of the price point you usually dont find this place packed with tourists like everywhere else in nolitasoho nice place to duck into after some shopping for a healthy delicious treat
how do i love thee let me count thy ways this is basically indian chipotle you guys indian chipotle i love how flavorful all the bean and entree options are without just being overwhelmingly oniony i hate onion overkill unlimited chutneys and sauces i highly recommend mango and coconut so many vegetarian and vegan options the corn and avocado curry is brilliant as is the kale and cauliflower i love the size options the petite size is perfect can choose between white and brown rice the prices are very affordable everything is constantly being freshly prepared and refilled nothing has ever tasted old or like it has been sitting out forever everything is really delicious no complaints here i love everything about this place
this has quickly become one of my favorite spots in lower manhattan created by the same geniuses who brought us public and saxon parole genuine superette is a nice treat at the border of little italy chinatown and nolita it has a very laid back and retro ambiance with a vintage tape deck on the wall there is also a window and you can see its a partial open kitchen if youre lucky you can watch the chefs cooking your meal we got to watch them make our ice cream sandwiches one day overall the staff here is friendly and they make great suggestions just ask for what their suggestions are my typical meal here consists fried chicken a glass of pot of vanilla bean ice cream sandwichmy boyfriend and i love this place and since its been open weve already been here more than a handful of times making this our new favorite we have also brought a handful of friends all who have also enjoyed their meals here although the portions are a tad smaller when you taste the food you surely will be content with the flavors and satisifed after your meal
people you should take your irish dad visiting from out of town beer a small group of friends looking to grab a beer when someone asks where next whats around a first date where being tipsy is appropriate not offensive a serious date when you order based on high alcohol content shown on wall and get halal food from the truck outside afterwards a self organized beer when looking for a straight bar in hells kitchen if you like craft beer and a big selection to choose if you dont mind small spaces and standing
boba guys taking over the usa one shop at a timei cant say enough great things about boba guys i remember when i first ventured into one of their sf shops last year i knew the east coast could use some boba improvement months later im happily sipping on their amazing drinks right in the heart of new yorkive pretty much sampled every item on their menu and my alltime favorite is definitely their coffee milk tea a balanced combination of smokey coffee and fragrant black tea its the perfect afternoon drink please make it a permanent item on the menumy other favorites include the jasmine milk tea and the thai milk tea i hate it when boba shops use too much milk powder because it makes the drink taste chalky because boba guys uses real milk it really allows the tea flavors to blossom making it more refreshing as a wholetheir boba is one of the best kept secrets soaking in a mysterious mixture of brown sugar and honey among other unknown ingredients its the perfect qq consistency if youre not a fan of firmer balls be warned that these boba balls will bounce back with every bite but in the most fun delicate cute waycant wait to see the boba guys brand grow in the city
yum step you choose a size the smallest size was more than enough for your first choose a flavor the coconut is the only vegan option the others have dairy the coconut is very coconuttystep free drizzle i went with salted caramel there are a ton of options like condensed milk chocolate syrup honeystep toppings cent each i opted for almonds and strawberries but there are a ton of way more delicious ones like oreos waffle come nilla wafers and lucky charmsyum yum yum i have convinced myself this is healthy not so sure about that definitely coming back oh and the spoon changes colors how cool
one of the best sushi restaurants in town tasty clean kind and fast service and now super pretty tooi have lived one block away from miyabi sushi for over years thats about the same time they were in the previous location until they moved to the new one just across the road the new place is absolutely beautiful and a must go to in greenwich village the owner is super friendly i always see him when im there and he is always making sure everything is going well and it does
its one of the best gelatos ive ever had in nyc period situated in the lower east side and close to katzs its the perfect snack or dessert if you are coming from the salty pickled meats of katzs deli not too many sit down or tables but having your ice cream isnt really a sit down experience wonderful service as the folks behind the counter are open to explaining each flavor and giving a taste the gelato is creamy and full of flavor definitely gives you a punch and you are carried away to the flavor you picked my favorites are the salted caramel buttery with that burnt caramel flavor and the salt takes it up a notch also a fan of the hazzlenut as you get that roasted hazzlenut taste with bits of nuts in the gelato all very refreshing well made and satisfying
this place does everything you could ask for from a winebar right intimate setting limited seating so that it doesnt become an exercise in screaming and leaning and reasonably priced wellexecuted food that actually shares well and the fact that you can drink any bottle on the list by the glass so long as you get at least two glasses patently ridiculous the list is easy to navigate organized geographically then by varietal then by price and while the variety of reds on offer is impressive negoska from greece strong in my opinion the whites are where its at particularly if youre down with chenin blanc from france and if you arent youre probably a scrub to sweeten the deal even more there are featured bottles at happy hour for which is often borderline retail pricethe greatest positive however is likely the staff who are in a league of their own winebars typically hire either the blas√© wellcoiffed jagoffs who pour you the wrong wine while staring wistfully at the equally disentranced models at the other end of the bar or the overeager pseudowonkish types who refuse to believe that you have no interest in a magnum of screaming eagle cabernet the vintenders here are genuinely attentive warmhearted people they truly love wine but dont snigger at the less educated or invested theyre happy to answer questions on any level whether its their favorite kabinett on the list or what goes best with the gypsy salami none of this is to say that they dont have nice hair of course they just arent dead behind the eyes if you like wine you owe it to yourself to make a visit and even if the dude or lady youve dragged out here for your requisite bimonthly date night doesnt like fermented grape juice theyve got some pretty dope beers just get him a pretty things baby tree and enjoy your paolo bea in awkward silent contentment youre welcome
i knew there had to be something better than barrys boot camp because jogging to death under a blaring speaker in a shoddy facsimile of a crowded miami nightclub isnt for everyone bfx chelsea is much bigger than it appears at first glance great when youre talking floor space not so great if youre talking about someone you met on the internetthey cater to a variety of workouts they have a spin class i choose to ignore i took the build class in the same room where they also have classes called burn barre and boxing clearly all the classes that take place in this room must start with bbuild uses kettle bells dumbbells and trx to build muscle burn focuses on cardio and i imagine it looks like that scene in flashdance where the lady is getting all splashy with the chair barre is like ballet and its for women no matter what anyone says boxing is pretty obvious marvelous marvin hagler yelled at me when i was a teen busboy so i hate to generalize but boxers can kind of go to hell i have taken three build classes so far and hope to build mass and be beefy like the mountain and have women wink at me and hand me their room keys in hotel bars so far its not going that well because i have a hard time making eye contact its a shame because i really want to see what my wife would say if i came home with a gym ladythis was my first exposure to the trx system if youre unfamiliar with the trx system its an strap that retails for trx absolutely destroyed me i was sore for days its the good kind of sore that allows you to build unwarranted selfconfidence by telling everyone that youre sore from the gym
this restaurant unexpectedly exceeded my expectations first i just have to point out that the service here is exceptional the waitresses were so nice and friendly and explained everything to us in detail they brought us out vinegar and taro chips the waitress explained that we can dip a lot of our dishes in here she also gave us a bottle of calamansi that we can add to our food or the vinegarbaked oysters these breaded oysters were so delicious it was flavorful and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside even better with a little bit of lemon on topspam fries this is exactly what youd expect battered and fried spam tasty but a little too heavy and salty for me it came with a side of banana ketchup very interestinggrilled octopus wow this dish was exploding with flavor first of all the octopus was soooo tender and eating it with the mango and the sauce was the perfect complement so goodsizzling sisig i always love sisig but the sisig here is so good all the meat is tender and even melts in your mouth its bursting with flavor and goes so well with the garlic rice fried chicken with purple yam waffle the fried chicken was good but the waffles im usually not a fan of waffles but these so good it was crispy but moist and a bit denser than regular waffles the anchovy compound butter and caramelized macapuno syrup was the perfect combination you must try this if you come hereduck breast duck was tender but the skin part was a bit chewy it came sliced on a bed of veggies and a side of grilled apple and eggplant this dish was good but it was a bit on the sweet side for memango cheesecake this was a bit too sweet for me but definitely tasted the mango in it if you like cheesecake and mango then youd like this dessertcoconut pudding not sure of the name of this dish yum this was creamy smooth and had little pieces of dried coconut in it not too sweet and topped off my meal perfectly
its excessive and its damn good look this place has over reviews a fixed menu and stars flying over its michelin constellation so ill skip the jibber jabber and make three solid points if the white truffle risotto add on is in season just suck it up and get it however youll only need per table of four or per couple if you wanna throw down the sexy time card its just too rich and decadent for one person being as selfcentered as i am i got one all for myself and regretted it as about half way through my tongue went dumb and nose closed its door allocate a good hours for the meal plus or minus min for the kitchen tour upon request i really wished i pocketed all the left over chocolate truffles and macaroons you wont be able to finish them all by the round of desserts generation asian guilt mom conscience would have scolded me for leaving food on the table in fact lets not tell my mom i went here at all insert dollar signs and bulging eyes emojisalso you cant tell me that the amusebouche does not look like a penis
a handroll barhad my birthday dinner here a few nights ago they were very accommodating with my extreme tardiness i would recommend making a reservation here ahead of time though it seemed like they werent as crowded as i thought they would and should be on a saturday night not even a line or anythingin my opinion domodomo is underrated and is a gem of a place that doesnt seem to be too hyped up by the foodie crowd yet the prices are reasonable quality of food is excellent and the service is impeccablewe were seated at the counter and served by at least three people working there their japanese beer is amazing and i dont even really like beer the cool yuzusmelling selfexpanding hand towel thing is an added part of the whole experienceto start we got the duck udon which at is actually very very well priced the duck was tender not overcooked and had so much flavor in it the broth was flavorful too the udon noodles were of perfect consistency overall a for this dish i would say however ordering this alone would not make you fullfor the rest of our meal we got the handroll sampler we started with a mini black truffle chawanmushi that was just absolutely delicious the black truffle was there but wasnt overpowering like you might think it would be so good the rest of the hand rolls fatty tuna salmon unagi and crab were all so good and so fresh even the seaweed was good i liked the hand rolls versus a roll of sushi because it seems like you get much more fish in your roll and can control how big of a bite you want somehow its just different the guy serving us waited until we finished each one and continued to serve us kind of like omakasestyleto finish we had the squid ink pasta with uni caviar and cheddar dashi it reminded me of a very high class mac and cheese only because of the cheddar dashi the squid ink pasta was probably the best textured pasta ive ever had beyond perfectly cooked the only complaint i have with this dish is that it could have had more uni and im not sure how i felt about the cheddar being thrown into the mix very unconventionaloverall very happy with domodomo and im glad i chose this lesser known place for my birthday dinner
this is such a cute place i am so glad my friend a regular of this spot showed me this gorgeous restaurantcash only foodmy friend ordered tapas the crispy potato the grilled octopus and the mushrooms the mushrooms were surprisingly flavorful the potatoes were good but not amazing the octopus was very fresh my favorite might be the mushrooms out of the trio i ordered the lobster paella holy moly was this a giant portion i think it was meant to serve two but i will neither confirm nor deny that i ate most of it took the rest to go then ate it around am that night yes its that good the lobster was a bit measly but the other seafood in it was generously portioned giant scallops fresh mussels etc musicatmosphere theres usually live music but we went on a friday and there was just a really cool playlist good for date night tons of string lights sangrias rustic wooden dining tables and cute wooden bar tables for more casual diners service we stayed from to midnight and didnt keep ordering drinks after the first set and they never tried to oust us instead they refilled our water glass numerous times this pushed the place from a star to a star

wowexcellent food excellent service excellent ambiance and excellent wine list all at a price less than what youd pay at a comparable michelinstar rated restaurant blue hill gotham nomad etc plus when you do the tasting menu you have several options to choose from for your courses as opposed to a set menu of courses like other fine dining restaurants and the wine list has many options of great wines especially red burgundy at only a markup vs a markup at other fine dining restaurantsim a sommelier for fun so this is an area of importance for me the sommelier brook was very helpful and her service was impeccable decanting our wine without me even askingwhich i would have for wine and dinner we had thechampagne rpouillon growerchampagne small producer amazing and at a great price red burgundy french pinot noir gavinet nuitssaintgeorges another amazing winerosemaryrye rolls butter both excellent and loved the french butter amusebouchericotta tart tasty but almost too coursebeef tartare the best ive ever had melted in your mouth with a savory black peppery flavor lobster salad very light fresh but enjoyed the tartare coursered snapper such a perfect combination of flavors with a sherry sauce that even nonseafood eaters would enjoy pork loin belly perfectly cooked and accompanying mustard sauce was to die fortrou normand palate cleanseramericanmexican stylestrawberry soda with a splash of agave tequila very tasty and couldve drank ten of themwhy dont they serve this shot at bars hahadessertgoat cheesecake with a cherry compote so rich and delicious and the whole cherries matched well with the goat cheesebased cakechocolate layer cake with raspberry sauce salted caramel yogurt decadent and paired well with our red wine but preferred the goat cheesecakecoconut cream merengue birthday cake complimentary so moist and flavorful and the merengue wasnt too hard or chewy perfect long island late harvest riesling was recommended and thought it would suck as its from li but definitely did not was delicious mignardisepetit foursalmond cake rolls dark chocolate filled with raspberry both very good but the chocolateraspberry combo was amazing complimentarytakehome cinnamon brown sugar muffin amazingly delicious even the day after the mealoverall this place is a wonderful experience with impeccable service amazing food and beautiful wines cant go wrong here for sure
truffle chicken nuggets so good that we paused in the middle of the first order to get a second round even before the pink slime fiasco i wasnt too crazy about mcdonalds chicken nuggets but how could anyone not love these beauties deep fried to a deep brown crisp and accompanied by a garlicky ranch dressing totally worth the hike up second avenue in all its current stages of utter demolition i suppose if you had to you could lump the miltons vittles into pub food but everything we ordered went above your average limp mozzarella sticks and potato skins the coconut chicken pot pie came with a little hat of flaky croissantlike bread i sampled some of my friends cottage pie braised short ribs mashed potato cheese otherwise known as winter hibernation food but my boyfriends burger took the cake as i was eating it i kept thinking to myself how in a true fit of gluttony i would not be above taking the french fries er chips and mashing them inside the burger i also ate most of the knickerbocker glory even though i never thought the combination of strawberry marmalade and ice cream would pair so well next time more of the fizzy pear drink more of the chicken nuggets more of the burger and maybe the milton kale salad because you know health
my birthday fell on a monday i dont mind mondays for a birthday no one else usually goes out so it is slower more relaxed etc my boyfriend planned a lovely fancy night that ended at amelie the place was packed yes on a monday it was packed thankfully we had reservations and were seated immediately i just adore everything about this restaurant the staff are incredibly friendly and from what i could tell all spoke french we easily settled in for a long and savory night first we obviously had to get a bottle of wine the menus are fixed to old records which was a fun touch most bottles were priced which is to be expected next on the todo list was to decide on what charcuterie to get they were able to accommodate our questions about the meats and cheeses my favorite things to eat surprisingly cheap at only for three choices the dish was served with grapes honey jam mustard apple cider red slaw and of course mustard and butter it was a dream we ended up getting prosciutto a creamy french cheese and blue cheese everything tasted just as it should if not betternow seeing as how it was my birthday i needed to end the night with steak and frites the steak was delicious as i got it medium rare it came with a scalloped potato and greens cooked with garlic and butter i loved it the frites were very crispy my boyfriend thought the soup could have been better salty and the cheese didnt seem right but still enjoyed itthey provided a banana creme brulee dish at the end for my birthday which was a sweet but not toooo sweet way to end the night when leaving the lovely staff all wished me a lovely birthday and my boyfriend and i decided to digest with a long walk to a farther subway stop top notch place ill definitely be back
just gowhere do i begin for a review of queen of the night just imagine doing coke off a unicorns back assuming you havent alreadyid say qotn is combo cirque du combo bacchanalian feast combo speed dating event if youre not an extrovert you might want to learn to be for the evening you andor your party will be seated at one of several tables where you will partake in communal wine and whatever the heck the kitchen brings out to you if its the brisket that brisket or lobster youre in for a culinary treat want something from another table haggle with your fellow diners usually with a simple exchange of food though if youre feeling particularly feisty im sure you could make out with someone to get a lobsterwatch out when they clear your tables theyre kind of eager and might take your its natural i draw this comparison speaking to performers after the show turns out many were trained in montreal
i love this bara buddy of mine recently invited me to the tippler for his birthday considering i frequent the west village i was surprised i hadnt heard of it little did i know its a bit of an underground gem aka a speakeasy bitch sorry i didnt mean to call you thatanyway the tippler is underneath the chelsea market and its quite large like really large whats interesting about the tippler is you could easily miss it the entrance is inconspicuous duh its a speakeasy bro and once inside you have to go down two sets of stairs to get to the barthe inside is great its on the darker side but the low key lighting rugs and optional tables on the side give it a really chill almost apartment like vibe despite the fact that its so large obviously the size of this joint is a huge bonus because ive never gone and felt uncomfortably crowded and theres always somewhere you can escape if you want to have a more intimate conversation with friends or if youre trying to woo a lovely lady or in my case getting horribly rejectedthe drinks are a tad pricey its the west village after all but they are fantastic unique and tasty personally im like a chick when it comes to drinks and i often find myself annoyed that drinks are over poured with booze as opposed to well crafted thankfully the tippler makes strong delicious cocktails for example i love the derek smallsit consists of zubr√≥wka bison grass vodka cucumber grapefruit anise mint i dont know what the hell bison grass vodka even means but i do know this drink basically tastes like an alcoholic green smoothie and you better believe the chick in me was loving this drinklastly and although insignificant to my friends i love love love yes three loves no shame people that the tippler offers self serve spa water infused with lime cucumber or something spa like after a heavy night of drinking this was so clutch as i progressively drank water throughout the night and woke up the next day sans a hangover not to mention it provided fodder for a series of jokes like alright bro hit me with one more for the road but thats the last one as we pretended to be grizzled truckers taking shots of water clearly my friends and i are a cool bunchone thing i would keep in mind with the tippler is theres something depressing about how dark and underground it is now i say that having come to the tippler in the middle of the summer and summertime in ny is all about outdoor drinking so i think this is the absolutely perfect winter bar and ill will undoubtedly be frequenting this place come the colder weatherfinal note i left my credit card at the tippler for over two weeks due purely to laziness when i reached out not only were they friendly and accommodating but they had taken good care of the ol girl the ol girl being my credit card of stars all around for tippler and once winter comes a bar that will be apart of my consistent rotation
man what a great experience i didnt know what to expect and this exceeded any expectation i could have had we picked up our tickets upstairs but the theater was downstairs we went downstairs to a theater where any seat is a great seat the stage was set for a nursing home one door they opened looked like a real bathroom inside their window looked like actual sun was shining through the set changed a few times one time the characters had a massive screen behind them so it appeared as if they were sky diving there werent many actorsactresses in the play but they were all good the two older women were hilarious i laughed throughout the entire play the cranky ladys humor were those one liners i wish i could always think of that pack a big punch in only a few wordsid absolutely recommend this play to people i wish them a lot of success because it was a wonderful way to spend a friday night
this is one of those places that i have bookmarked for when i accidentally stumble upon a pile of unclaimed cah money that mysteriously regrows itself its archived for some future utopia where first world issues like health insurance prudent retirement planning and alzheimers dont exist because zzs is nothing but pure indulgence and possibly the greatest threat to your financial bottom line since obamacarelike many before me my mind was blown from beginning to end throughout the threehour rendezvous with zz the drinks menu is overwhelming only because the options all look equally enticing after some deliberation i went with the buddha because who could resist magical potion in a buddha belly i cant even remember what was in it only that it put me in a deep state of bliss several heavenly uni toasts scallops and yellowtails later i was drunk with love i recalled the fledgling days of my youth the nascent buds of young love the first time i laid naked eyes on my untamed childmanlover gliding over the sinusoidal waves of his ginger peaks and valleys and then the grandmother of all dishes layers upon layers of chianina beef carpaccio spread generously interspersed with sea urchin and topped with caviar the carpaccio yielded to my tongue without resistance the sea urchin was as delicate as a lovers touch and the caviar a product of their love the holy trinity of sea treasures together in one place an explosion of culinary chemistry i let myself succumb to it willingly casting away all my worldly worries to be simply and utterly awash in this sea of joyrising cost of tuition looming water crisis such trivialities pick up all the litter from your humdrum life and stuff it in the back of your closet put on your best suit and head to zzs because sometimes unchecked indulgence is just what you need
oh my goodness gracious i was going to not write a review at first because i assumed all ethiopian restaurants in ny were about this level amazing but after a recent bad dining experience elsewhere ive decided to give injera the great review it deserves because it is my favorite ethiopian restaurant in the city the ambiance here is so cute and romantic the service is amazing they are so friendly and take the time to explain each dish and make sure that you have everything you need but i know you guys just care about the food so let me get to that the yetimatim fitfit diced tomato red onion tomatoes avocado green chilies pieces of injera with olive oil lemon dressing has been the best ethiopian appetizer ive ever had its such a great take on the usual ethiopian salad my roommate and i had the vegetarian combination for two and we were in heaven usually the vegetarian dishes at other ethiopian restaurants arent so flavorful but this was the most flavorfilled dish ive had in a long time i dont know why anyone would complain about small portions i eat like a truck and even i was like rolling out the door by the end of dinner i didnt even have room for ice cream which is unheard of anyways i highly suggest anyone who loves flavor and spices to go go go to injera
im literally going to have a panic attack due to the fact that the mark is only stars on yelp its times like these i wish i could give a yelp seminar on what makes a great restaurant if someone were to ask me what my favorite restaurant is in manhattan i eat out literally every single day and most days twice a day usually at top notch restaurants i would say the mark why you ask well let me explainatmosphereupper east side traditional with a modern twist the crowd is definitely the movers and shakers of the upper east side the restaurant oozes modern luxury the hotel does as wellservicethe service is always great sure maybe there are a few hiccups here and there but honestly nothing to get upset about or notice the first time i ever came here my friend made a joke about it being a special night or something and the waitress brought over a complementary dessert its that small touch that brought me back here a second time with my family and friendsfoodhere we goi really dont enjoy eating at fusion places which blend different styles of food together or places that have large menus i feel like a restaurant should pick one thing and just be very good at that well the mark has a huge menu huge huge huge the mark has everything from sushi to fresh seafood to steak to pizza pasta cheeseburgers veal lamb chicken do i really have to continue you will feel anxiety just reading the menu as the choices are honestly definitely has a fusion of many different types of cuisine all on one menu yet all surprisingly well executed seafood platter small portion absolutely delicious and was an amazing thing for of us to share i think its honestly priced lower than it should be for a seafood platter of that size so take advantage of this lobster absolutely the best thing on the menu that i have eaten thus far while it was plated differently the two times that i dined at the mark the flavor was still the same lamb my friend stated that this was one of the best lambs he has ever had crispy sushi really great i was cautious with this dish as i eat sushi as some of the best sushi counters in the world and am extremely picky with raw fish but this was not bad for a place with such a big menu i was very surprised at how good this dish was char grilled octopus delishi cant remember the other dishes that i had but those were the ones that really stood out to medessertim actually not a big sweets person i used to be and then thankfully grew out of that stage thankfully as in calorieswise butterscotch pudding salty sweet butterscotchy dear lord one of the best desserts that i have ever consumed in my entire life i absolutely adored this angel food cake delish but not as good as my butterscotch pudding vanilla icecream with chocolate sauce sounds very simple but this dish had a lot of flavor actually it comes very nicely presented as well selection of sorbets also very well plated and tastyi am a huge fan and will definitely make this a regular spot
so im at the bodega and mario the hardest working man in two bridges while slicing my boars head honey turkey tells me that a new bar has opened up the block now anywhere else in manhattan another bar opening would be about as newsworthy as another cosby accuser coming forward actually i guess that is still newsworthybut you get the point if you are at all familiar with my personal chinese shtetl and particularly the immediate surrounding streets where rats dine on the finest fish guts this side of the yangtze you would understand my intrigue upon hearing this news several days later while walking my gfs dog we passed by and went in to take a look we both were kinda shocked to see what they had done inside this former nondescript storefront on the most random block in the city maybe mechanics alley is the new poor mans freeman alley so yeah the bar looked great not a dumpy dive bar but nothing pretentious or artificial eitherjust right since it had just opened and it was midafternoon we were the only customers there after scoping out the inside i went to see what they had on tap and met the bartender and part owner aisa class act as my adoring yelp fans are well aware the only thing i really care about is if a bar has perfectly carbonated ice cold coors light on tap go ahead roll your uppity eyes and judge me but i wont apologize for enjoying the best domestic beer ever made imagine my delight upon learning that they have coors banquet on tap just as coors is considered the prototypical uncool beer mr fongs location is equally uncool or maybe so uncool it is cool i suspect this is their angle after having a beer and one of their signature cocktails we checked out the jukebox which was also impressive i have not been back since that first time but have passed by several times and it was crowded who the hell are these people and where did they come from i get the feeling more and more that in a couple years im not going to recognize my neighborhood and since it is such a dump im fine with thatsorry i meant i will fight gentrification and organize the community to keep the streets smelling like fish guts seriously im happy to see that mr fongs is doing well and hope to return soon
sakagura is where we had our second datewhere we had responsibly shared a single carafe of wine on our first date this time we got ridiculously aggressively comically drunkso anyway we met in front of sakagura its in a very ugh part of town midtown east i remember approaching the spot and seeing him leaning against the streetlight in his white polo shirt and khaki shorts like some sort of preppy pied piperi was wearing black leather combat boots grey acidwashed jeans an oversized asymmetrical hoodie and my school backpackwe were like two enemy chess pieces meeting covertly offtheboard to discuss a possible armistice despite our bloodthirsty generalswe go in and order some sake id furtively eaten a cream cheese bagel on a park bench right before because we were meeting for drinks at dinner time and im the rare bird on this island that actually likes to eat three meals a dayanyway the conversation went like thishim so hows schoolme its okhim so hows lifeme its okhehe i dont know then i grabbed the mic and started asking the questions because i was never socialized properly into society my questions went like thisme do you want to die by fire or drowning or buried alivehim drowningme lameme would you move to the jungle if it had great wifihim i guess some wrong the insects would kill youit continued like this until he got drunk to escape me a trend that has carried on to this very day i didnt think i was drunk until i caught myself leering at my reflection in the mirror with a knowing smile when i was washing my hands in the washroom thats when i knew i was a little sauced up toowe played a little guess what those people over there are about but it was not too stimulating everyone there was obviously a office worker relaxing over drinks with coworkers before taking a commuter train homeafter a few rounds of drinks he said want to order foodi said i was not hungrythe other thing is that i had planned to go to a danish house party later that night our first date had been short so id assumed this date would be short toobut i realized that i liked how he took my questions seriously mulled over them respectfully so i invited him to come to the danish house party with meoutside on the sidewalk we were shy and formal again we hopped into a cab and sped towards the east villageit was our first time in a motor vehicle together i pointed out my favorite street meat vendor spots he blanched at street meat but thats what i still call it to this day it is meat that you eat in the street street meatanyway before we went to the danish house party we decided to get some more drinks at dgbg first i dont recall how that came to be to wash down the sakei had a martini he had a martininext i remember walking against traffic up bowery theres that soft spring wind that swirls around at night like youre being caressed by ghosts my boots stomping with unnecessary assertiveness maneuvering around orange plastic construction pylons and drunks gathering their things in the backseat of impatient cabs ready to pick up new fareim leading the way hes behind me or maybe its the other way around doesnt matter we are equal partners in crime snaking through all the lovely detritus of a warm friday nightand even though there is no mirror in front of me this time i catch myself smiling againif you want to start at the beginning go here
pizza is one of my favorite foods it had gotten me through some rough times in life so while browsing the internet i came upon this tour and thought why not the best thing about scotts pizza tour is scott himself he is so knowledgable about pizza i learned so much from our tour his excitement about pizza and the history of the new york pizza landscape is impressive i love that he has these little gadgets like his temperature gun and his tiny pizza wheel you get a goodie bag that is awesome my favorite thing in it were the gummies that looked like pizza the tour i went on was the original walking tour i forgot the actual name of it the pizza was fantastic we went to lombardis rubirosa and prince st pizza all very good and worth a trip down to soho oh and in case youre curious scott does not eat drunk pizza
i booked a couples massage with my girlfriend she got there earlier than me and texted me while waiting downstairs saying that it seemed sketchyi arrived a few minutes late and we walked up the stairs into a nice little spa and no it was not sketchy they were really professionalthe couples massage room is fights up we had to wait a little because they were behind schedule this place is small but clean the rooms are separated by curtains the best part is that there is a sign on the wall saying no hanky panky and to not take off your underwear i read the no hanky panky part but did not read the rest and took off everything by mistakethe massage was good if you check in with yelp you get an extra for free for min of massage hell yes they even used hot stones on your backif you pay with cash there is no tax they do accept credit cards too
when deciding where to eat tonight with friends this restaurant name resonated with us so we decided to give it a try we arrived around on a saturday night they dont take reservations for parties smaller than six so we were expecting a wait surprisingly we were seated pretty quickly to minute wait at most the restaurant is small and bustling the dining room is decorated simply with an impressive bar upon entry and a huge golden pizza oven in the back we decided to share everything we started with the beets which came with pickled red onion pistachios and ricotta salata and the kale which came with garlic chili flakes and ricotta salata both were great but i especially liked the kale it was seasoned well and i was in heaven with those bulbs of roasted garlic we then shared the gemelli pasta which was served in a pesto sauce and topped with stracciatella cheese the pasta was good it was cooked al dente and the stracciatella was a nice touch we couldnt leave without trying the pizza so we decided to split two of them as the name of the restaurant suggests the pizzas are wood fired theyre meant to be individualsized and have a rustic look to them with charred edges and an overall irregular shape we went with the goat cheese and the j sexton both were great the flavors worked well with each other and the woodfiring technique really showed service was awesome everyone from the hostess who greeted us to chef chas anderson himself did a really great job super impressed i had a great experience overall definitely a place i would return
see my last review for more details if youd like but i feel obligated to bump up my rating to stars i came here this past weekend for the first time in a month or so and have nothing but positive things to say the crowd is boisterous but not obnoxiously so the bartenders are downright awesome and obviously the beer list is expansive creative and diverse and tasty cant forget tastyeven when this place is packed as it was this past weekend im always aware of how full of good vibes it is lots of chill people with a passion for beer just looking to have a more lowkey night something about arts and crafts being below street level makes it like a cozy little nook i love it if you didnt get that alreadyi felt the need to update my review because on this past trip i conquered a flight of beers with a friend were both very into craft beer and are interested in sampling as much as we can responsibly of course so we were very much up for the challenge a flight of board is bucks if youre splitting that between two people its a really really good deal thats per person if youre including tip which is basically cocktails at a speakeasy if you check out my picture youll see that they give you goodsized glasses so dont get too overzealous or you will get blackout i cant see how you wouldnt when we asked the bartender about the full flight he said well its possible but the two of us wanted to find our way home that night so we did the responsible thingfirst things first youll get a paper and pencil to list your choices they were actually out of a few beers we had listed but fortunately that meant that a number of beers on their coming soon list was comingright then and there so voila more beers to choose from if there werent enough already they give you your flight based on the order of the beers youve chosen im not sure if all racks are circular im guessing they are but youre encouraged to go clockwise the first beer you pick will be at oclock i mean technically you can make it whatever o clock you want but you get the point and then you just rotate around simple enough if youre with someone whos as interested in broadening their craft beer horizons as you are id highly recommend this option theyve got such an impressive draft list and for someone whos addicted to trying new things the flight option is really the only option

i hardly do any yoga any more in fact i have skipped yoga for several years now truth be told i have barely been working out lately so it was with considerable skepticism that i signed up for a class at lyons den a brisk fiveminute eastward walk from where i livethe venue has had some interesting uses for it previously but the makeover to being a yoga studio is impressive it has a very east village vibe to itcasual and invitingbut a distinct tribeca feel when you factor in the loftier setting and the older crowd relative to the college kids flocking along st marks placethe ownersbethany and johnare very friendly and engaging bethany seems to be a unique talent who is motivating mindfully merciless with the intensity of the flow and has great command over what goes on in her class the other instructors seem very effective as wellannie meg and brooke to name a few the power flow yoga classes operate at a brisk pace and are sure to leave you sweating and well exercised is lyons den at an early stage of its evolution and growth when everything is brandnew and everyone is friendly and accessible i sure hope not while i cant see how the business could grow in its current location i suspect new locations could spring up over time hopefully not at the expense of diluting bethanys and the other teachers commitment to this tribeca gem
i am so happy that this place is in the hood and today i got to try it with some friends visiting from out of town i stopped in about weeks ago and asked some questions to the friendly handsome bald bartender he was very friendly and told me this place is the sister restaurant of fogetmenot how cool the ambiance is intimate airy and open i showed up a few minutes before my friends arrived at at noon this place was just starting their day i had a choice of any table in the house sweet my friends showed up and we started salivating over the menu one of my friends and i decided to order a half carafe of house rose good amount of alcohol to share and all wines from greece this place does a very decent job showcasing greek food i am a fan too bad they were out of the octopus because that is what i really wanted to try my friends and i decided on a few plates to share including spanakopita taramosalata fave beans dip sauteed shrimp zucchini chips with mustard dip and roasted potatoes everything was very tasty and flavorful and came with unlimited amounts of homemade grilled toast with olive oil the standouts would have to be the taramosalata and the zucchini chips great to have a new place in the hood to hang out with friends so happy you guys are here in leschinatown yippee
this is review i had saved it for a special place and m≈èkbar fits that billthey say true geniusoften strikes in the pale moments between awake and asleep i must have been sleepwalking all these years because i havent truly had koreanstyle ramen until today and the experience i had by definition was a culinary eyeopener this brings us to why we feel m≈èkbar is deserving of the brainchild of njnative esther choi began operating in chelsea market in may of billed as the first koreanstyle ramen in the city theyre situated across from los tacos which im not a fan of you can read my review on that riding on a wave of high acclaim from media outlets esthers food network appearance on beat bobby flay aired sept in case youre interested catapulted the restaurant into the cross hairs of the masses for better or worse having cut her teeth with experience at ilili and la esquina also helped hone her craft from training at institute of culinary education icewhen i first visited one afternoon months earlier i had the classic ramen my mistake it didnt set my palate on fire i returned to rectify this on a thursday chelsea gallery opening night ordering dishes until i bursted with fruitflavorfoodfor small plates or as it should be called anju we ordered hocakes japchae dumplings tteokbokki and spicy mok wings anju is typically accompanied by alcohol so we simply had to have the soju sampler where each glass come flavored by a different fruit or inspiration sorry i cant remember them all the hocakes otherwise known as hotteok are every bit as amazing as ive heard about these savory stuffed pancakes of pork every morsel with satisfying chew it was probably not meant to be shared because it will fall apart if you try to cut into one of the halves hahaha the japchae dumplings although true to the dish that it draws inspiration from i prefer my japchae served up on a plate not so much in the form of a dumpling just my preference however the dumpling had a nice crisp to them and the glass noodles danced around inside my mouth with the accompanying sauce being spoton the tteokbokki was a nice surprise because ive made them at home with gochujang and so i know that the rice cakes are typically huge logs with satisfying chew their take is a fantastic departure in that theyre the size of penne with crisp chew and heat all in the same bite this would ideally go great with beer in any case they were still crispy even while marinating in the sauces impressive finally the mok wings which we ordered spicy were marinated in gochujang the right amount of kick without overpowering the flavor of the wings simply fun to eat much like the tteokbokkifor my entree i ordered the kimchi ramen along with porkbelly and extra noodles because you can never have enough i enjoy these soups thatre served hot and also packing sufficient heat despite the summer months the presentation is all there sun noodles as everpresent in commercially produced ramen is also nice to see the porky soup broth provides the requisite kick and flavor from the kimchi as expected the cabbage itself provides all the veggies id like to eat for the night allinall i love it without the egg definitely onpar with all the ramen heavyhitters in the cityserviceservice is as quick and attentive as youd expect from a standalone restaurant making sure your table never runs out of water getting small plates to the table first getting entrees out altogether checking on your experience basically all the little things which always ends up mattering so muchetcvegan ramen is offered and this means misobased this is huge a restaurant offering a menu set of this size is remarkable considering the spacekitchen they have to work with they have seating by the kitchen counter and in the back away from the prying eyes and those seatvultures in chelsea market yes like you i am one too the only drawback i find with m≈èkbar is that its set within the busy energy that is chelsea market amidst the hustle and bustle of shoppers stragglers lunchgoers foodies ive heard my fair share of ignoramus commentary while waiting a few minutes for my table like what kind of chinese is this and so i also dont especially welcome the prying eyes burning into the back of my skull nor the onlookers with the look of bemusement gazing at the bizarre foods that im savoringsummarym≈èkbar is a solid casual dining option among various noncompeting choices in chelsea market catering to both tourists and workerbees alike from around the area eg google the only korean eatery within the chelseamepa districts offering ramen and gastropub anju fare i can see esther take the m≈èkbar concept into its own standalone restaurant as it truly deserve a home to call its own
lawrence and david are my shit alyssa kills it too katharine is great and so is siobhanthis yoga studio was hard for me to find i visited at least five other studios in my search of the one my journey ended when i found modo hot sweaty classes with great facilities and conscious teachers its a beautiful thingstart off with the traditional modo class if your even somewhat new to yoga and especially to modo even if its just one take it and get comfortable with it its always the same postures every single class so you know what to expect they have different time lengths and next try modo flow similar to modo in that its the same postures every class but its more challenging you get in numerous chatarungas and its very similar to a typical vinyasa flow but always consistent again they offer different lengths of time in the classesthen grab a freestyle flow vinyasa class with ever changing postures and sometimes depending on what it says on the schedule they have music playing in the background these teachers dont mess aroundcome ready to sweat and flowthen my favoriteyin yang get your flow on for the first half of class think freestyle flow then slow it down and get into the yin portion you will walk in there thinking its not that hot and that you absolutely will not be sweaty and then just wait this class will kick your butt and stretch you out in the most delicious ways lawrence is my favorite teacher for this style of class they offer minute versions but try the minute it doesnt get any better reallyone other thing that reeeally turned me on to modo is the locker rooms clean showers but best of all lockers that lock out of all the ny studios i visited before modo none had lockers i could lock ive had my debit card and id stolen at a studio before so thats a huge priority to me just because were all looking for enlightenment doesnt mean someone wont snatch up your purse duringafter class
bno with the guys was quite a feast here as some classy gents such as my buds dan c and dave h joined me to partake in an evening of manly men steak consumptionput on that suit and tie grab a cocktail at the bar sit down and order a steak throw down the credit card and enjoy life the only thing missing was a good cigar we did it right here and they took care of us great service the food was on point and atmosphere was sophisticated but not overly upscale and fussy nice scene at the bar with an affable bartender and cool tunes playingdont heed the haters here as it seems many of them would also whine about their burgers at white castle not being good enoughis it pricey you bet thats what a steakhouse goes for in nyc deal with it and eat thats why you throw down the plastic and have at itwhat can i say other then we picked out some great wines my filet mignon was perfectly prepared the sides such as grilled aparagus mushroom caps and mashed potatoes were just right and the manager even came over to say hello and had some extra appetizers sent to our table complimentary now thats what i call an epic mealgreat food great conversation great company great fun thats what a bno is all about to eat loads of meat and talk about manly things without our gals being around for a nightdat popover served up first tho dayum
delicious had my eye on oiji for a while given all its rave and writeups in food blogs galore luckily it lived up to its hypei made a ressie about weeks out and was only able to nab a pm reservation on a wednesday so make sure you book early ressies were made quickly via opentable my parents and i walked in and were seated right away the space itself is pretty darn small mostly seater tables with a handful of bar seats we saw some walkins throughout the evening that were able to eat at the bar so perhaps you will have luck with that sans ressiesfor the three of us we ordered the followingfried chicken yummm cant go wrong with fried chicken this is basically a cutlet split up into or so pieces the batter on this was perf and the dipping sauce delishjangjorim this was recommended by the waiter to round out our meal it was so good the butter on this was amazingtruffle seafood i could have done without this dish hard to taste the truffle and while there was a decent amt of seafood i dont believe it justified the price tagssam platter so fun to make this we all had a blast making our own lettuce wraps and the sticky rice with the pb sauce combo is amaze slow cooked oxtail absolute winner of the evening it came with large pieces of fall off the bone oxtail so yumzhoney butter chips nice way to round off our meal be aware that the sticky sauce is super syrupy and youre likely to get it all over your clothes if youre unluckya slobbasically methey recommend about dishes per person and we were nicely stuffed by the end of the meal everything tasted homey and flavorful we did not order any alcoholic drinks as i noted to our waiter that i wasnt feeling that greathad a sore throat he came back with hot water w lemon and even refilled it for me super good service
the dive bar lounge or dbl as we fondly call it is the new gay bar addition to the hells kitchen area this place has been transformed numerous times but im sensing this time it will stick around for a while we love coming over here during happy hour frozen margarita on a hot spring days draft beer and well drinkson a nice day you can sit at outside tables this is really a great place to start a night
yeah im a product guy big shock since i am in the branding marketing etc game whats worse is my big weakness wellmerchandised items while i remain brand loyal i recently decided to switch things up and start buying my skin face shower stuff from kiehlsi know i know late to the kiehls gamenot really i was with kiehls then left then came back several timesits like a marriage i cant let go ofmakes me look good but at a price the struggle least theres no alimony or child supportthis third avenue store occupies the street corner there are typically a couple of benches outside during warmer weather for folks pause from the hustle and bustle its a nice touch and nod to the former neighborhoody ways of nycthe store gives its nods to oldschool apothecaries and still manages a seamless flow to the modern day the transition from exposed brick and offwhite walls then floored with light modern woodscreates a nice clean visual flow as the space is broken up by modern and oldschool product metal displaysracksbins with a mix of eclectic decor items like the skeletons a nod to kiehls roots in medicine and science and motorcycles something for guys who dont want product but are shopping with their gfs and wives the store employs the clean aisledisplay conceptmerchandise is concentrated in spaces with wide lanes of travel as opposed to having the space broken up by retail displays and tonsvarieties of productthe staff here are clad in lab coatsapothecary gear they act not only as sales people and brand ambassadors but most importantly as folks who can speak intelligently to the products in the store by assessing your hair skin etc needs and suggesting the items that will give you that rounded edge approach i find the the kiehlsters really pleasant always saying hello to you and pretty helpful i only shop when one kiehls staffer is there as he knows what i normally buy can suggest stuff to complement and give me the headsup about products that id want also i feel like using only one particular staffer every time im there shopping gets me free samples that i want or are open to using so choose your staffer wisely and dont forget to sign up for the kiehls rewards program you earn points for free items get a free item on your birthday and get mailers on specials etc the products themselves are great the quality of them for the most part are miles ahead of what you get at your local supermarket drug store convenience store midtier dept stores etc however prices can be steep on items but quality over quantity as your kiehls items tend to last longer bc you dont need to use of tons of it to see feel the benefits at work as opposed to cheaper products which need to be slathered on multiple timespackaging is simple either black on white or a simple primary color much like the store itself or the ingredients list of the merchkiehls employs the less is more by using high quality over quantity and it stands behind this by its generous sampling policy from a store product and retail experiencetheres not much to critique except that they dont have beard products for dudes yet but they are in development drops mic because i need both hands for my face and moisturizing regimen i outzzz
i know that there are three different handrolled ice cream locations in nyc but i have so far only been to two and of those i would strongly recommend choosing this location iceny not sure why all those hyphens are there but who cares im here to judge the food not the name my gf is a huge instagram food blogger check out hungrynyc if you ever get a chance and was invited over by the owners to come check them out she brought me along and we came here on a saturday afternoon to put the taste to the testwe arrived at when it opened but it was still closed i gave them a call and they apologized that they forgot to flip the sign outside we entered soon after and told them that we were there from the instagram page the guy at the counter danny or dani sorry i asked how to spell your name and i already forgot smiled and explained to us the origins of the handrolled ice cream and handed each of us a menu the gf wanted to split an ice cream neverrr but i acquiesced and decided on the thai iced tea flavor with lychee part of the setice creams on the back of the menu then we watched one of the servers make the ice creamthe whole liquid nitrogen technique is really awesome i saw it once at below but it was cool to see the little differences here below usually rolls larger logs for one bowl but iceny makes around smaller ones so it actually looks more presentable we sat down with our ice cream and immediately dug in no we did not my gf took minutes taking photos during which the ice cream started inevitably melting the ice cream texture was a bit rubbery because of the mixed in lychees so that was odd however the flavors were all there and it had a nice strong complex taste that i think puts it far above its competitor the only thing was that i didnt think that the pocky sticks it came with added to the taste its cute and fun but flavorwise didnt do much for me the servers probably noticed me feeling very sad about the lack of my own ice cream so they made one just for me it was the strawberry cheesecake one with strawberry puree and cheesecake bits on top this one had a more subtle flavor but the presentation was nicer the gf had a field day doing the photoshoot overall i think the thai iced tea had a better flavor and was more delicious both are amazing though we want to return to try the other flavors this is the best new ice cream shop for both flavor and serviceedit we came back exactly a week later because we couldnt resist staying away tried the green tea with condensed milk mocha and poppers best one so far also got the banana chocolate delicious as well im not a banana person but i still gulped the whole thing down
this is the changing point of the heights i gotta say i was very impressed walking past this newly built hotelwalking across the street this hotel caught my eye and i was actually waiting around to go to a yelp event cause i didnt really want to truck it back to the bronx just to wait so i decided with the amount of time i had left to walk in and see what this place was aboutthe lobbyit was extremely hot that day and i already had a button up shirt and a tie so coming into the lobby the ac hit my entire body instantly as the doors opened up i noticed the front desked people were up front they greeted me upon me walking in and i asked if i could have some water i was dehydrated so i thought i asked and they actually gave me a bottle of water so that in itself was a awesome gesture in my book so i took a seat the front lobby seats were colorful and literally so comfortable i was dozing off lol the bathroom so of course i wanted to do some sightseeing so i walked around and found their bathroom and it was so clean and fresh i was more than happy to use itroomsroomsroomsfrom walking from floor to floor cause i was walking around looking in the building i noticed the rooms thanks the cleaning lady being finished and it was a descent size room with a king size bed with a huge tv and the bathroom from what i saw was very upscale was very impressivethe resultsoverallid would love to throw events here i noticed that they were more space for things to be done so in curious to see what in stores for this hotelthis place just opened and already they choose to open in the heights which could be a hit or miss but already they are making a excellent name for themselves here in the heights i wish them all but the best and i will be back to try this place out
i love dim sumbuddha bodai is an excellent choice for gettogethers whether its an intimate dinner or brunch with a group of friends as they offer an array of chinese dishes that is sure to please omnivores and vegans alike the dim sum offered throughout the week till pm is served hk style which ensures that each dish is freshly made and not sitting around all day unlike the carts in other dim sum establishments their vegan spare ribs which has a firm texture and sweet marinade taste even better than what you would get at a nonvegan restaurant the crullers wrapped with rice paper are quite addicting the steamed veggie dumplings were also very good as per the regular menu i had the mushroom and bok choy with black pepper sauce the sauce was light and the dish was a large portion enough to share between two peopleim definitely a fan of the buddha i think if you give them a try you would be toohappy eats
i might be a little biased writing this review because after all i just so happened to propose to my girlfriend of two years at the top of this magnificent skyscraper but all that goodness aside we had a fantastic visit from start to finishfirst and foremost the impeccable level of customer service here deserves a serious shoutout only three employees knew my secret plans to propose here but everyone treated us like royalty anyway from the entry process to the elevator ride to the citypulse demonstrations even the gift shop as someone who frequents yankee stadium also managed by legends hospitality you really cant put a price on good service well actually maybe thats what those stadium hot dogs are all about i digressthe friendly folks in one mix restaurant the middle of the three tiers of dining options who were aware of the proposal plans really went above and beyond the hostess secured us a beautiful window seat facing north towards midtown and the manager offered to record video using my iphone he offered us a round of champagne complements of the house with a nice little sugary congratulations decoration bearing the one world observatory logo a really nice touch our server fatima was terrific and gave us both a hug and let us really enjoy the moment and the view during our mealheres a quick video of our visit the proposal sweeping views of all five boroughs and beyond one world observatory is definitely worth the visit if i were to pick one area for improvement though there are far too many people sitting on the windowsill just doing nothing signs should either be put up or some benches should be provided so people can take a quick break as theyre taking in the beautiful views im sure that by keeping everyone standing that encourages people to look around and leave but again tourists are still sitting down except now theyre on the windowsill getting in the way of the views and photos
turning up on a tuesdayi preordered cronuts which i highly recommend i was in and out within minutes which included time i spent drooling over other goodies yes i waited weeks to get mine but you wont catch me in a line at with no guaranteethe cronut itself was bergamot and earl grey and the flavors definitely complemented each other the first bite was bliss crispy flaky light sugary so fing good when i opened my eyes i noticed the earl grey cream oozing out so so so goodnext time i go ill definitely try the paris ny which is a take on the amazing paris brest anything with chocolate caramel and peanut yeah buddy im in there
we were so pleasantly surprised by izakaya due to a poorlyplanned sunday evening nap time we ended up dinnerless at pm our usual goto was closed so we turned to yelp for suggestions stars is a good sign anywhere so we came here its an unassuming little holeinthewall near alphabet city sunken into a small stretch of lane peppered with other small foodie joints to be honest we expected to eat well but nothing fancy the photocopied menu doesnt say much about the amazing fare available youre best off asking the waitstaff for their top recommendation or what people order the most often their obvious enthusiasm and intimate familiarity with the menu was very refreshing and got us very excited about our foodwe had the cold tofu the beef sashimi the omelet and the chicken nanban as well as the kagua blanc beer we were the only ones in the restaurant so everything came out at the perfect pace not too quick not too slow the tofu is dryaged for two days so it has a custardy texture the aging process allows the whey to naturally drain out they top it with a sharpflavored leafy garnish in addition to fresh scallions with homemade dashi soy sauce mmm the dashi was a little bit salty but it helped with the creamy tofu texture i just dipped sparingly no big deal as the waiter passionately explained the raw beef washu i believe is a hybrid between kobe and angus cattle for a mediummarbled fatty texture that isnt too heavy afterward it was scrumptious and didnt even require any of the dipping sauce to taste delicious i wrapped mine around some of the green scallions and left out the wasabi to enjoy the full beef flavor on my tongue mmm the chicken nanban was the juiciest bite of fried goodness ive ever had it tastes like the chicken is marinated in the same salad dressing it comes with and then lightly battered and fried the ranchytartare sauce was a little overwhelming for my personal taste but you can easily scrape off any excess if you so choose the salad was very fresh and light the perfect complement to the chicken as for the kagua beer it was very light with some unique piquant notes to it my beer palate isnt very refined so i cant tell you from taste how it stood out ill just rely on the waiters description of it being a japaneseflavored beer made in belgium that sold out in japan in two weeks special water used for the brewing process and some special japanese ingredients i believe yuzu citrus and a japanese chili pepper delicious and well worth the the little details like very highquality disposable chopsticks are what make this place a fivestar experience again very pleasantly impressed my expectations werent high based on appearances
one of the most iconic and famous museums in manhattan the met has something for everyone for you gossip girl lovers sit on the steps of the entrance to live out your serena blair moment you can also get in for a suggested donation most recently i came to the met to see the china through the looking glass exhibit i really enjoyed it and it was one of the most talked about exhibits since mcqueens which the fashionista in me very much enjoyed im glad i made it there after work before the exhibit ended and it wasnt too crowded at nightif fashion isnt quite your thing then there are plenty of sections for you to check out about ancient cultures there are also various events throughout the year that are worth checking out so keep your calendar updated this is by far one of my favorite museums in manhattan and i enjoy coming here a few times a year
snowdays is a heavenly place for shaved icesnow lovers i went gaga over the myriad yummy toppings i decided to be totally unoriginal and go with made in taiwan which im sure every other asian girl orders it had everything i wantedmatcha snow mochi grass jelly condensed milkeverything except red beans so for cents i added the red bean topping and it was bomb i love the matcha flavor it was not too sweet and had that familiar grassy taste i love but it wasnt overwhelming maybe just maybe if i scrutinize the flavor it could be a little less sweet i felt a sticky sweet aftertaste in my mouth but that could be from the condensed milk overall great flavorfor the uninitiated the made in taiwan combo is very traditional taiwanesejapanese once you try it you will know exactly why matcha mochi grass jelly condensed milk and red bean always go hand in hand they also have a variety of interesting flavors like yeti tracks and you can be like a kid and add fun things to your snow like pocky sticks rainbow sprinkles peanut butter sauce etc etc
i was really surprised to find such a high quality tea shop a couple streets down from columbia i just moved here and was frantically yelping bubble teaboba places near campus since im used to having near me at all times in california although culture tea bar was highly rated it didnt seem like as many people knew about it or went there this made me question how good it really was but i decided to give it a try what a treati ordered an iced osmanthus oolong milk tea with less sugar and though it was slightly sweeter than i would have preferred the tea flavor was distinct and fragrant i was very impressed to learn that they brew each tea to order with looseleaf tea leaves using a tea brewing machine that looks similar to an espresso maker it was refreshing to see that they had actual tea variations like fuji apple black tea cherry blossom green tea and blended black tea rather than flavors caramel taro etc that rely heavily on powders and syrupsthey do take credit card but remember that theres a minimum since theres wifi and some limited seating it would be a nice place for studying when its not too crowded however the tiny space can get quite cramped so id recommend getting a drink togo will definitely be returning
ladies and gentlemen i present to you one of the best bars ive ever been to i went here on a sunday night around with three other fabulous ladies the atmosphere is amazing cozy and familiar yet trendy and modern it felt like a bite out of williamsburg there was a fantastic singer singing in the front and there was a crowd gathered near him i think his name was john shmidt this man was the star of the night he had us dancing and singing along to it all from sheryl crowe to bill withers to bruno mars to billy joel to boys men he really made our night was told this place is known for their gin and tonics and my winslow vip friend recommended the dorothy parker gin and tonic isnt on the menu tried hers and it was delicious so had to get one for myself at just it was worth it in short awesome atmosphere fast and friendly waiter holding down the fort great live music and good drinks go here you wont be disappointed
ruggy js review was like pavlov ringing the bell for me and yelp pointing the direction to daveys as a person who one summer made quarts of ice cream a week i can attest to daveys superiority in the homemade ice cream niche good ice cream is expensive and i can tell when good ice cream is made from expensive ingredients because thats what i usedthe chocolate chocolate here was an explosion of deep cocoa flavor and cream smooth and so rich you know your tongue will never tire of licking this stuff up the strawberry had a strong taste of the berry in that same smooth cream repetition may ensure you get bored with your cone and cup but the flashing lightbulb in your tongue and tummy will tell you then to lick the ice cream off some sweet someone because fellow yelpers even if you have the same flavor over and over again this ice cream you wont tire of it is really good my friend had the pistachio the creaminess of the ice cream offset by the graininess of pistachio bits we both knew quality when we tasted it elation in a cone
friday i was really in the mood for sammys downtown bistro but had never been to rosies bistro italiano just up the block from sammys and my aunt told me that i would not be disappointed she was percent correct i would probably give the overall experience a stars but the risotto served with my entree bumps it up to a solid this is a cute italian restaurant in downtown bronxville located near the train station pharmacies grocery store and other restaurants i stopped in for an early dinner on friday and was sad to hear that this place does not do happy hour no sweat though i was greeted by the hostess who walked my aunt and i to our booth our server was kristen who listed the specials for the evening and was very friendly and helped to answer my stars for service she was quick and made sure to check in between courses and ask how everything was arugula pear gorgonzola salad with pecans and cranberriesabsolutely delicious lightly dressed to perfection im not a huge gorgonzola fan but do enjoy this combination in a pasta di boscolinguine wild mushrooms artichokes pancetta and garlic tossed in white truffle oil this wasnt my dish but it was outstanding and had quite a bit of truffle not just a hintone of my least favorite things to encounter when promised this divine treat this was a really satisfying dish although i would have enjoyed a bit more pancetta seemed a bit panseared chilean sea bass in a tomato white wine sauce this was topped with toasted pignolis and served with a parmesan risotto plus two negligible asparagus stalks the risotto stole the show this cheesy trufflehinted veggiespeckled rice was creamy smooth and needed no additional help to brighten up my hectic week i actually exercised incredible restraint by only eating half of and leaving the remainder for my leftovers the next day mmmmm the sea bass was flaky and had a nice thin crust on the outer layer this dish was one of the specials for the evening and i wasnt originally certain that this was what i wanted for dinner but the risotto and our servers very positive attitude about it made me curious i stand by my choice after feeling that there was no way on earth we could possibly make room for another morsel of food we decided to consider that the dessert menu might feel left out if we didnt at least give it a peek chocaholic that i am and considering the medicated cookie dough that was a prequel to dinner i suggested to my aunt that there was no harm in splitting the chocolate souffle with vanilla bean gelato the gelato was decent but nowhere near the best id had and the souffle could have been a touch warmer it was served with one lonely strawberry and s sprig of fresh mint it was a dessert i would love to give this place a second try and see if the peachblueberry cobbler is as amazing as it sounds id recommend to anyone who wants a taste of great italian food
this is the kind of coffee place i dont want to tell my friends about because its so good and i want to keep it all to myself the space is charming lots of seats free wifi and dapper dressed baristas the decor sets the perfect ambiance to write read or meet a good friend im obsessed with their chai lattes iced or hot i havent tried the food yet but ive seen photos of it and it looks mouthwatering if i wasnt fairly low in funds at the moment i would find myself there every day
tanoshi has long been on my list of omakase places to try despite all of the good things that have been said about it and the high grade fish the restaurant itself is unassuming and low key the sushi bar seats people and there are three sushi chefs one for each corner of the bar this was on the side we were on they have storefronts the omakase is per person and it includes pieces of nigiri one handroll and small sushi rolls while the omakase itself may be reasonably priced there are a lot of items available for a la carte that can rack up your bill there are two lists on the wall of the appetizers and the add on pieces and a hand drawn map of where all the fish is sourced from we ordered the chawanmushi the ikura uni and ankimo the chawanmushi was delectable the texture was silky smooth and there were pieces of chicken shrimp and peas inside the ikura uni was basically a sandwich composed of salmon squid and uni and boy was it a generous helping in fact i think there were more parts of uni than salmon the ankimo or monk fish liver is a must have the texture can take some getting used to but it is definitely one of my favorites the omakase began with fluke the fluke was delicately sliced with an interwoven technique and it was the perfect size next we had the alaskan king salmon seared in propane for a few seconds salmon is one of my favorites so this was very enjoyable one of the more exciting pieces was the amber jack fish topped with a cherry blossom leaf the leaf was edible and extremely fragrant i also really enjoyed the firefly squid something ive never tried before while the rest of the pieces were delicious i think its important to discuss the add ons the normal sea urchin that tanoshi uses is from maine it is absolutely satisfying but for sea urchin connoisseurs you will want to order the japanese uni which is from hokkaido another must try piece is the triple x salmon roe sea urchin and quail egg this piece is absolutely exquisite my friend tried the ice fish this is poached which we did not know beforehand there was a novelty about this but we probably wouldnt order this again instead i would have tried the crab brain shout out to geronimo who really made our meal we talked to him throughout our meal and he was very knowledgeable about all the pieces
fancy was made to be played here paintbox is like a pink unicorn glittery and girly fancy and fun lavish and luxurious definitely not your average neighborhood nail salon its a treat i had a gel manicure with design yesterday and was super impressed with everything from the moment i walked in to the moment i walked outi suppose ill start with the staff theyre all sweethearts both receptionists and yolanda my nail technician were friendly welcoming and genuinely sweet girls even though it was my first time here i walked out feeling as if i had been coming here for years also one of the receptionists unfortunately i cant remember her name refilled my champagne glass every fifteen minutes thank you i was loving the champagne almost as much as the manicurethe actual service my manicure was amazing like really really amazeballs amazing i loved yolanda she was the perfect combination of talkativequiet like you dont want to be sitting in silence but you want to chill out and relax its a fine line if you know what i mean i had the electric feel from the springsummer collection i love love love it its my first time with foils and its safe to say im foilobsessed theyre just so pretty i cant stop looking at my nails i was also very impressed with the nail preparation im very picky when it comes to my nails and she did everything perfectly ie shaped buffed clipped etcpricewise its not too expensive but of course that depends on who you ask for me someone who regularly gets a gel manicure with design its normal but like i said its for when you want to treat yo self have a glasses of champagne lounge and remember to do the mani cam
i have nothing but big gay love for this place the ice cream creations are so much fun the unicorn on the wall really makes me happy beware of coming here on summer weekends because there will be a line around the corner and this location is a hole on the wall a very lively hole on the wall i love the monday sundae with some rainbow sprinkles the american globs is my second favorite and i usually get the cone lined with nutella dont eat the bea arthur on a windy day specially if you like what you are wearing because the nilla wafers will take over your body like glitter does to a drag queens worth it tho a layer of nilla wafer crumbs wont look nearly as glamourous as a layer of glitter you should get the salty pimp if it is your first time here the salty pimp will make a believer out of you dont forget to get a punch card because you will come back and getting free ice cream once after hundredth times lol is such a glorious thing always check and try the seasonal softserve flavors like coffee nutella coconut cinnamon toast crunch etc

in a sea of sushi spots mocu mocu provides a muchneeded shot of fresh japanese flavors in hells kitchen coffee and bento boxes yes please did i mention theyve got booze and sweets thats a winning combo i havent seen in the neighborhood since menu isnt complicated but the way the menus presented at the counter can be if youre a firsttimer the choices can be a intimidating ask questions and the welcome staff will steer you in the right directiontheir baked okonomiyaki makes for a satisfying lunch i went for the pork belly which went well with the oshinko pickles the accompanying white bean and pork sausage miso soup was my fave hearty with light spices on the side salad was a citrusy vinaigrette that i couldnt get enough ofstop by the library next door grab a book then swing by mocu mocu for a latte and bring a friend bring a date or bring your anyone else remember use common sense and dont loiter for hours
what can i say that everyone else hasnt already saidim a foodie like i live breathe and dream of food i go out to eat every single day and sometimes twice or three times a day my guilty pleasures include you guessed it fooda friend of mine had suggested that we go to madison park for quite some time alas just a few short days after they were named the best restaurant in the world we decided to make a reservation and go all outi will start off by saying that i truly enjoy food experiences i love hour meals tasting menus cocktail and wine pairings you name it i feel that this is lost in the modern age of dining as usually people want to get in and get out not me and not madison park dont come here if you want a quick meal or really anything less than hours dont rush dont panic relax woooooosa its okay sitting down for a great length of time and trying out heavenly dishes isnt so bad trust medecor ambianceart decoformer bank to be honest im not really a fan of art deco or bank decor i would just say that this isnt my style however a great deal of people love the decor here so its really just a matter of preference the ambiance is great as it just oozes elegance everyone is dressed from head to toe in pure perfection one word classicservicetopnotch would you expect anything less the service was absolutely perfect and usually poor service is my greatest pet peeve at restaurants bravofoodwhile ive had some truly exceptional meals in my lifetime this one was definitely in the rankings every dish was obviously very tasty and delicious but i was particularly surprised by the creativity behind each dish at the very end of the meal chocolates were presented with a little guessing game many different flavors were presented and one would have to match the unknown flavors to their names later someone brought a cheat sheet and provided the correct answers i really liked this as it just seemed like a really fun way to end the eveningwill i be back yes i want to come back and try their lunch actually mmm mmmmmm mmmcome here expecting not just a meal but an experience also make sure you ask for a tour of the kitchen its immaculate
i really bask in any opportunity to be pretentious and feel socially superior while sipping on expensive cocktails surrounded by waiters wearing sleeve garters working in an astounding event space lined with sumptuous mahogany holding up shelves of unread leathersleeved booksthats actually my ideal barhaving to face the bitter reality of walking outside to the concrete cityscape and going home to my apartment which features significantly less mahogany and an illusory number of ritzy bartenders ready to get loose was an alltoonecessary reminder that i should leave the nomad to special occasions
i was informed of this place last year but it was the one in williamsburg not being a fan of the boroughs i never really made it out there luckily for me anything in the boroughs can be found in one form or another in manhattanafter a trek through chinatown i stumbled across this placefor starters it had air conditioning on a really muggy day so that was a huge plus the bowl of bacon was what sparked my interest in the first place and i finally got to try it they serve it with maple syrup it was divinedrinks are well priced and the bartender was very friendlybest part about this place is the clientele youll see everything from lawyers to college kids to old chinese men to tourists looking to get away from canal street the location is very strange since it is a very white establishment in the middle of chinatown highly recommend it and next time im there i may stop in for more bacon to go with my bubble tea
i am obsessed with lyfe kitchen ive been going here at least once a week the food is delicious fresh and healthy i love that the calorie counts are listed for all dishes and drinks my favorites are arts unfried chickenthe sauce on the brussels sprouts and squash is finger licking good i actually want to lick the plate clean and the breaded chicken is juicy and flavorful and the goat cheese and mushroom pizza is also excellentthe crust is superb the space is quite spacious and inviting however this seems to lead to the entire restaurant being nearly empty every time i visit im concerned that theyre not doing enough business to stay solvent people really need to find out about this place because it is an awesome fast casual option where you dont need to feel as guilty about enjoying a delicious meal
people get so excited about ramen but i never really understood the appeal until i went to totto ramen a few years ago i went to ippudo and thought ok ramen can be very good but was not blown away a couple of weeks ago after a play we tried totto i was in shock how insanely delicious the soup washandsdown this was one of the most delicious soups i have ever tried the service was great too the music was beyond horrible it was almost as if the owner was making fun of us by demonstrating that he could play the worst music ever and yet we would still wait on line to eat his soup part of me felt like a detainee at guantanamo bay being exposed to enhanced interrogation techniques i did not break i was going to leave stars because they would not give us a container to take home the unfinished portion of soup but i just cantthe soup was that good
total yoga here didnt even google positions or watch videos before taking my first class loved all minutes of iti signed up via classpass which is a godsent for indecisive people like me it was a basic class with erin teufel on a sunday afternoon i had zero yoga experience and had to look around the entire time to avoid looking the part the class was wellpaced for beginners with erin focusing her attention on everyone getting into the correct positions in a way it felt like a private yoga class in a room of people practicing downward dogi loved the class so much i quickly booked my second visit if youre hasty about joining in because of inexperience give it a go one sunday afternoon you wont regret iteven on monday when youre sore
after three different feasts here ive gotta weigh in im pretty shocked that a place sitting on the infamous st marks gauntlet can be so authentically executed every staff member ive encountered there has been extremely professional and respectful the decor is cute without being cliche and yet still classy even with people clustered around the door waiting for tables they somehow manage to keep the atmosphere cozy and not too crowdedloud this in itself is a huge feat for this area of the east village i originally stopped in to try the xiao long bao soup dumplings ive now tried all variations crab wasabi super spicy and kung fu regular they are all delicious but be prepared to have your entire mouth on fire with the super spicy i have never met my match in spiciness until i put those in my mouth dont get so distracted by the xiao long bao that you dont try other things some musts pork knuckle soup amazing the leek with pork spicy eggplant peashoots wood ear and mapo tofu there is some controversy amongst my dining friends about the mapo tofu the bao decided to make it vegetarian and some people insist that it would just be so much better with pork lets be real most things are but i still think its pretty delicious this is one of the few chinese places that i feel like i could visit again and again and still discover new delicious things also you can tell they dont cheapen the dishes by just adding msg or corn starch you leave the table feeling satisfied but not sick heavy or comatosebao down btches east village vicious
im a big fan of their original restaurant malatesta so i was really excited to hear they were opening a sister restaurant closer to homespaghetti incident does not disappoint we had two arancini a naked woman salad the carbonara and the salmon aparagi pastas everything was delicious but the salad was fanfuckingtasticits super small inside i counted seats its going to be hard to get a table here once people find out about iti probably shouldnt post this review
i have something important to tell you i said i cowardly turned away and concentrated on the glass of water in front of me what is it he asked i stayed silent the place hummed with murmurs and clinks but the weight of my confessiontobe dampened those sounds what is it he repeated is there someone else he pressed on i couldnt look at him a drop of water dripped down the side of the glass at an impossibly slow rate i may have to leave you for this smoked arctic char i felt his stareits okay i was considering leaving you for the roasted duckthe droplet rolled onto the cool white tablecloth and vanished this was one of the best dining experiences of our lives even though the executive chef is moving to the whitney im sure both the foods quality and the service will stay the same with the passing of each seasonlikelihood of another visitduh
i really love earls beer and cheese its such a great spot for this area straddling the upper east side and east harlem earls gets bonus points in my book for its proximity to the metro north undergroundabove ground transition transit nerd protip if you wait to watch a southbound train go by you can wave to the conductor and hell most likely wave back i was way too excited about this interchangeso the latest big news is that they have expanded this tremendously popular place is no longer the size of a thimble there is now an open back room with i think more large tables so i no longer have to restrict my visits to summer offhoursive tried a few things on the creative menu but have settled on the mac and cheese which always allures with its creamy decadence and sprinkles of rosemary i also like earls taco which combines slow cooked meat with flecks of mexican cheese a cabbage slaw and a delicious hot sauce the taco comes on a scallion pancake which i think is brilliant and lends a uniquely satisfying texture and thickness to the dishthere are a lot of fauxhipstercreativefoodie restaurants supply house im looking at you on the upper east side that dont deliver and are merely trying to cash in on a trend but earls beer and cheese is the real deal
such a nice cozy place for drinks and dinner decorated like a speakeasy this place has loads of charmchandeliers and sconces black and gold wall paper leather booths black and white photos on the walls great beer selection here but also good fruity cocktails too i had the ommegang belgian and it was delicious the food was surprisingly good too the eggplant and bbq chicken flatbreads were delish everyone at the table loved it the pepper appetizer crab cake and the tagliatelle were all really good we came early so we got spoiled in the beginning having every server serve our table good and friendly service check out the jack and jill bathrooms overall i really enjoyed my experience here and would highly recommend
i have to tell you after the trying experience i had at another establishment this week tonight was a breath of fresh air hubby and i made reservations for my girlfriends birthday weekend we were late as per usual but angel the manager greeted us and accepted us in with open arms from the moment we walked in we felt welcomed and my girlfriend and her boo were already at the bar sampling some of their amazing cocktails the dining area is intimate and the decor is sexy this is a perfect date night spot they sat us at our table and we were overwhelmed by the menu items we ordered the calamari short rib arepas and hamachi ceviche for our apps let me tell you that ive never had calamari with maduras sweet plaintains but omg they were amazeballs the arepas were bomb as was the hamachi dish my girlfriend and her love ordered the parillada to share which included ribeye chorizo morcilla arepas short rib and bone marrowyes bone marrow hubby had the arroz con pollo and i went with the paella de mar everything was spectacular while we ate the table next to us was also having a birthday celebratory dinner but the birthday boy went to the bathroom right before they arrived at the table with his dessert and sparklers when the staff realized what happened they quickly grabbed everything went back to the kitchen and presented the birthday boy again they kicked butt in the customer service department the wine list is a perfect size they have a nice selection we went with an albari√±o and enjoyed every last drop when it was time to surprise my girlfriend with her birthday dessert they also hooked us up with comped champagne i have to tell you that they made us feel like regulars despite the fact that weve never stepped foot through their door before tonight the night was a total success and we had a very special intimate tasty and wonderful mealthank you so much to angel jos√© and the rest of the yerba buena ave a staff you guys did an amazing job and made our night the best yerbabuenanyc
a bonafide awesome cocktail bar in the east village dead drop is a musttry on the cocktails bar list this is probably one of my new favorite speakeasy spots next to places like angels share and little branch admittedly i would hate to reveal too much it is a spot to check out though if you want quality service and very well made drinks a lowkey sexy yet simultaneously casual atmosphere i will say in short that there is very little to dislikelocated inside the north river restaurant in the east village go down the small set of stairs upon entrance a button on the wall will call for the hostess who should open the door promptly it is firstcome firstserve basis so obviously you will want to come earlier than later if you want to avoid the wait not a very large place but accommodates just the right amount of people for a good nights crowd without being obnoxious i love the red walls and the dark intimate and super cozy atmosphere it creates two bartenders man the tiny bar at the front but this tiny bar has a lot to offer what is great is the breakdown of their menu which displays yet to be classified recently classified to from the archives under these categories is the classification of lethal and lively lethal is of course the stronger of the cocktails lively is the refreshinglighter ones i started off with a lethal red orchestra gin kumaru maraschino cherry brandy and celery bitters this was an excellent stiff cocktail yet not peaty and smooth to the last drop second drink was the classic yet lethal martinez from the archives old tom gin sweet vermouth maraschino bokers and orange bitters again while it was a lethal martini it was very tasty and easy to take down with each sip service was excellent too as one of the bartendersservers was very helpful in providing input i will definitely be returning to dead drop soon bring a friend or two a date and you should not be disappointed do not be shy going for the lethal cocktails either they are all tasty and will be worth it in the end
steve cohen must be a smart cookie he has a degree from cornell sports rimless glasses and a threepiece suit and his expression exudes intensity but i will remember him most as a gifted magician who captured my full attention during his amazing minute show at the waldorf last yeari didnt expect the show would be at a fancy suite in the hotel and i didnt expect i could watch him at such close quarters while i managed to snag frontrow seats the performance conjures up the intimate setting of century parlor magic regardless of where you are seated steves portfolio of tricks included thinkadrinka tea kettle that produced five different drinks all at the audiences request and also mind reading really and cards if you are not averse to spending almost a ticket on a magic show note i have a great interest in magic i would strongly urge you to experience steves show at the waldorf it is money well spent
this place is literally days old i stopped in tonight to check out the hester nights that is at the klimpton hotel and well this stand caught my eye ever since i went to hawaii i am always on the prowl for a good poke sadly in new york those places are hard to find the next big food craze hopefully is poke on the east coast the owner was really nice and he told me that he used to hang out a lot in hawaii and he would surf and well eat poke cool i am glad he brought this to nyc the poke bowl i had tonight was made from yellow tail tuna and it is from fulton market up in the bronx did you know that the fulton fish market is the second biggest fish market behind japan good to knowso i had the tuna with shoyu it comes with some flakes of seaweed spring onions and pickled onions i also asked for additional topping of masago roe and toppings are additional cents you can also get jalapenos kale added on top oh and there is a choice of shoyu vs aioli sauce white or brown rice and for i walked away with a very delicious healthy bowl of poke lets make this place famous and a staple to nyc good eats

pizza in nyc are for those people who are too lazy to microwave their own frozen supermarket pizza if you notice they all pretty much taste and smell the same all days everyday when ever you pass by themi definitely cant say that here just walking in the scent of fresh baking pizza fills the rustic decor of this tiny pizza establishment and most importantly the pizza here is like eating a fresh out of the oven lombardis pie this is new york style pizza at its finestlovely fresh tangy tomato sauce perfect crispy thin crust and gooie tasty cheese there is seriously something different about this slice that made me do a triple take in one seating i recommend just a plain slice and avoid the toppings their greatness resides with the basics crust sauce cheesethe owner reminds me of the soup natzi but hes truly sweet at heart he knows lots of the regulars by name and has a strong following all i got to say i am so glad i live far from percys pizza otherwise i would be eating here every daynow stop reading and just grab another slice you will thank me later
wow this place really impressed me i work a short walk from this fast healthy restaurant but since its not on the way of my commute this was the first time i passed it as i was going to another store the taco tuesday with tacos beer wine i was sold on it because with those prices i gotta check this place outwhen i walked in you can tell it has a very family friendly trendy ambiance going on you walk all the way to the back where someone prepares the food fresh in front of you the ingredients they use is really fresh as you can see from my photos and they prepare it very quickly as well i got a chicken taco and an el pastor taco which we so delicious and exploded with flavor after it was prepared i payed at the register where i got two beers which were smuttynose ipa and sierra nevada ipa now dont get too excited they were smaller glasses but still a great dealmy coworker and i took our food and ate upstairs and thought about how awesome this place was and we boggled why there werent any people coming in after work for drinks and tacos we will definitely be back with more peoplei think the owner can make a few updates as well with advertising on the taco tuesday sign outside by explaining that these are specialty tacos and that the beer isnt cheap bud light it is craft beer
this place is definitely no secret but the restaurant is hidden like one sakagura is located in the basement of a building once you walk into sakagura it crazy how the restaurant went from to it feel like you are walking into a restaurant that located in japan the quality of all the fish is amazing and the portion is definitely enough for someone to get full off of from looking at the picture we had to order the sakagura lunch tasting course we decided that the sakagura lunch tasting course will be out appetizer then we also ordered the una and higawari set sakagura lunch tasting course start off with a appetizer with kinds of sashimi then came the main course of assortment tempura shrimp white fish and vegetable grilled fish beef fillet steak and cold handmade soba cost the freshest and best tasting sashimi that i have had in nyc the beef fillet steak was really amazing and something i would just order by itself next time the shrimp inside the shrimp tempura was huge and not just tempura i think that the sakagura lunch tasting course makes a great appetizer for two so that you can try a large assortment of food the una don was huge this is probably the first time that i was unable to finish my food at a sushi restaurant for lunch the una don came with a full serving of eel in a large bowl of rice the rice and eel was both covered in eel sauce which was amazing and tasty we also ordered the higawari set which was a part of the valentine week special that sakagura was offering the service is amazing the waiter was very attentive and was on point with refilling water and tea the waiter also informed us on what part of the the sakagura lunch tasting course was placed on the table i highly recommend this restaurant and i can not wait to come back
holland bar is narrow crowded with random but interesting customers old not very pretty with cheap good drinks served by charismatic bartenders in other words its the perfect dive bardont expect to find a seat bring cash stand drink converse and enjoy the juke boxholland bar keeps it simple just the way i like it
finally i made it out to seven grams caffe after hearing about it long ago and not making it into the elite event prior seven grams is actually pretty close to my apartment but ive yet to make it out here during times that are reasonable to drink coffee and not be awake til unable to sleepfaced with either cold brew or iced coffee for my cold coffee choices i went with just a regular iced coffee because i always get scared about cold brews ive had far too many cold brews where the coffee is just sour bleh the barista also told me if i wanted a less acidic taste that i should go with iced coffee the decision was a good one some of the freshest not so bold yet not too watery iced coffee ive had for a while im usually a fan of gregorys coffee iced coffee and this one comes out even or even tops it i also like that they offer simple syrup a small little thing i wish other coffee shops would do the worst thing is getting all the granulated sugar at the bottom of your iced coffeewill definitely be returning
well talk about a completely different experiencei first visited the gowanus dinosaur bbq read my review i wasnt particularly pleased and to be honest i really wasnt willing to try again even though i said i would its a schlep but when i got a last minute notice that the jewbadours were going to be at this location in harlem i jumped out of bed and rushed over about hour after the start of the show i figured what the heck if theyre done at least i can get something to eat im so glad i did yo seriously halem dinosaur you need to talk to your sister gowanus shes making yall look bad everything i had a problem with there was perfect here dinosaurs greens are always great exactly like homemade no stems great spice only thing missing is pieces of ham hock the chicken dark meatribs combo was perfect came from the kitchen hot enough to still be warm while i was too busy recording the jewbadours playing and the mac cheese how could it be so different from the one in gowanus the best one ive had in a long time i had some hiccups with service but since im proactive and not a person who complains all the time really i dont the thing that tipped the experience over to stars was the jewbadours i live for live music live for it so the fact that theres a little stage over by the bar with regular live music will definitely get me to come back even if its just for drinks if the pina colada machine is working next time i will be ecstatic see i dont complainthe two ladies next to me were ready to throw their heyzelekh at the stage they were killing all the blueeyed soul standards of the all of them hopefully yelp will actually upload my video this time but it doesnt do them justice theyre pretty much touring the dinosaur bbqs in the city but im coming back to the harlem one if they play here again are you listening harlem dinosaur harlem loves sara smile and baker street harlem wants steal away what a fool believes harlem needs it keep up the good work

the evening was coming to an end and some nights you wish could just last forever enter rin thai as we debated calling it an early night however sometimes one has to feed an insatiable hunger before calling it quitswalking in minutes just before the kitchen close was of no consequence our waiter was courteous friendly and attentive without being intrusive we enjoyed the comforts of the talay fried rice and the tamarind chicken not being a huge fan of thai food i must admit that i was actually shocked at how well both dishes were executed along with their presentation the talay fried rice contained a delicate balance of seafood which was tender well seasoned and only slightly spicy i quite gladly bypassed their drinks to savor all of the complex flavors with hesitation i contemplated trying my companys tamarind chicken i was afraid to throw off the wonderful balance from my palate but i am glad i didnt pass up the chance to sneak a bite of that crispy savorysweet tamarind chicken the bathroom was spotless and beautifully decorated along with the rest of the space with a serene zen theme i would recommend rin thai for small groups or an intimate date
let me tell you about my only vice ice creamthe ice cream here is so good it gets stars even though literally the entire menu board says coming soon sundae soda float ice cream sandwich cold brew cone toppingnormally this would be extremely frustrating but what they do have more than makes up for it flavors of top quality inventive unique fun ice cream served by two of the most pleasant genuine and friendly ice cream shop owners in existenceive tried ice vice a handful of times over the past few years at places like the astoria flea and other events around queens and have been eagerly awaiting the opening of this new shop in chinatown which by the way is really looking up now along with mission chinese food and piesnthighs right nearby i was actually excited to find out that they also just started selling their product out of the little muenster stall in hudson eats which is another major win for the extremely ice cream deprived neighborhood of battery park citythe abundance of flavors makes up for the lack of cones or other vehicles for trying them as they are so complex and fun to try that it works in just a cup milk money and basic b are two of their most incredible flavors which i had the pleasure of getting from little muenster last week so on this initial visit to the shop i had to try other flavors i know i have a problem look at how unique the ingredients are in some of these shade smoked dark chocolate caramelized white chocolate ganache vietnamese coffee donut truffle movie night buttered popcorn toasted raisin dark chocolate flakes nuts of wrath marcona almond grape koolaid jam three little pigs salted caramel bacon butter bacon praline mahjong jasmine tea leaf white peach peach lambicthose first flavors blew me away each was more incredible than the other and i couldnt decide which was the best of the batch the last were much more of an acquired taste you really need to like bacon to enjoy the three little pigs as it super bacony and you really need to like the taste of alcohol in your ice cream to enjoy the mahjong im not the biggest fan of these two concepts in ice cream but they were still delicious actuallythis is an amazing addition to the neighborhood and fills a major ice cream void as well all we really had previously was chinatown ice cream factory a little further north and maybe mo ii gelato for another good option this is definitely my new go to in this area and i am excited to see all of the stuff coming soon

freemans was one of the first and most memorable places i visited in nyc right before moving there a couple months later i was looking for a place to have brunch with my family for my birthday and was drawn to this place in particular because of the lovely rustic decor and the fact that it was hidden and off the beaten path i will never forget turning a corner and walking down that very unassuming urban alley that leads to a tiny rustic entryway one minute i was in new york and the next i was somewhere much more remote the interior is stunning i am a sucker for atmosphere and this place really did a great job in that department there is lot of warmth wood flora and taxidermy its simple rustic and reminiscent of an old world hunting lodge or farm house the menu is great and offers a nice variety of simple hearty american fare downstairs was a little more tightly packed but we were seated upstairs which was less busy and had more room to spread out since we were a larger group the food was fantastic and everyone enjoyed their meal adults and kids alike the brunch cocktails were great as well and the prices were very reasonable ive returned one other time just for drinks downstairs unfortunately that time the service was not very good because our bartender was not very nice but i wont hold that against them since my last experience was excellent all around i would recommend freemans for a variety of occasions its great for brunch with friends but at night i would imagine it is super romantic and therefore would probably make for a great date night spot i cant wait to come back for dinner
so good so good the sweet milk cream had us so excited after we finished our large bowl that we promptly went back for a green tea round of seconds will definitely be back would love to have egg pudding as a topping option
saeeds food is amazingly good and really complex plus i love how he cares so deeply about his food i havent had a chance to dinein bu bf rode his citi bike down to the shop to get us some persian goodies we had the famous thick winter veggie soup which was so fresh and wonderfully homemade it had a lot of flavors going on but all came together nicely spinach dill noodles crispy garlic especially this yum and then some we also split the stew of the day which was an awesome shredded chicken dish with very royal rice and sour cherries i love how the menu changes often because i believe any kind of experimentation coming from this joint is a good one for both items and healthy portion sizes too there is something special going on here for sure
best place for new dim summers ive been coming here for about years and have brought many new comers along the way i promise you that it will impress the place is massive with a big escalator bringing you to the large banquet hall which is actually used as an event space and sectioned off for weddings and such its size atmosphere and food are all very impressivewhen you are seated you will receive a card for your table that servers will stamp when you order a dish that is small medium or large as the servers push the carts by you will see an array of mainly southern cantonese style small dishes you will point out which you want they give you the dish and stamp your card easy as that when you are stuffed and cannot eat anymore take that card and head to the cashier by the escalators to pay your bill tip is left on the table food here are the staples that we cant dim sum withoutha gao shrimp dumplingsui mai pork dumplingcheong fun shrimp in think rice noodlespare ribs on thick rice noodlewu gok fried tarocha siu bao roast pork bunlo mai gai sticky ricedan tat egg custard tart for dessertfew other quick tips cantonese call dim sum yum cha which means to drink tea so when your tea runs low take the top of the teapot and tilt it that will let your servers know its time for a refill there is a buffet style setup along the long wall that will have your more interesting food items were talking snails stomach fish balls and also some killer veggies get here before to avoid the rushmy only complaint is that they recently started trying to jump in on the nyc boozy brunch scene by offering a bar cart with mimosas served by americans dont get me wrong im all about the boozy brunch but it unfortunately makes this place a tad less authentic
maple bacon cookie yes please red velvet cookie yupgreen tea cookie hell yescookies cream cookie thats a givenchocolate duet cookie duhhhchocolate chip i think im going to need another boxthe cookies here are amazing theyre freshly made soft and super decadent indulge those taste buds and practice your willpower i apparently have none more cookies for me

im almost torn to write this as id love to keep this hidden gem all to myself lest it become the next hot commodity that takes months of planning to get a reservation atdomodomo is probably my favorite discovery of im always on the lookout for great japanese spots and am surprised that the opening here didnt get more fanfare in addition to being able to order a la carte domodomo offers what is probably one of the most reasonably priced tasting menus in new york courses for courses for domokase courses sushi pieces for got the last optionwhich i thought was just a little too much food but as always my eyes were bigger than my stomach highlights included the truffle chawanmushu jumbo oyster eel and katsuo sashimi comes with an awesome mango salsa the one noticeable item that isnt on any of the set menus is the uni pasta so next time i think ill go with the middle option and pasta to shareone of my main gripes with asian restaurants in general is that dessert is often forgotten about and every restaurant will offer some sort of green tea ice cream or cake and call it a night so i was pleasantly surprised with the hojicha pudding which had just a hint of sweetness and a great smoky flavoredit they now also offer a sushi course it comes with edamame to start pieces of sushi a crab handroll an eel handroll and dessert for
what a wonderful wonderful place to go to for brunchi have to admit im not big into going out for brunch because most places i have been to have just been a disaster and it was just cheap and disappointing but off a drunk late night whim aka great idea when youre drunk but terrible idea to try to wake up soberhungoverit was definitely something memorablei made reservations drunk the night before for and a person decided to join us last minute which they were able to accommodate for about was a good crowd still and yet it seemed like the service was fully concentrated on our table and only our tablethe food was impeccable the trout hollandaise was the most perfect combination of crispy creamy salty that i have had it sounded so good that out of of us ended up getting it yummmmthe escargot were piping hot perfectly seasoned not overly salty perfect accommodation to the bread basket that they kept on bringing the oysters unfortunately were out of a few types but we ended up trying other types that were fresh and delicious as wellthe bloody marys were made with love garnished with pretty lemon lime celery and even olives and they werent stingy with the alcohol definitely hangover cure i even tried my cousins mimosa and is was made with fresh juice as welland i guess my cousin has been there before where she said hi to the owner and he mustve overheard that its her birthday brunch so he sent us over free dessert and coffee as welljust a wonderful experience and even though this was about a month ago it was such a great time that i remembered it just like it was yesterday highly highly recommended
the quick a fantastic hole in the wall spot for roast pork over rice with cabbage for which is so tasty if you dont trust me trust the line down the block at all times moves quicklythe details as with all my favorite hole in the wall restaurants i like to be very upfront right away there are no chairs in this restaurant it is take out only this is actually a good thing because the line is always down the block full of locals and yet it moves quickly we just walk to the park near by to enjoy our meal outside comfortably as far as i know theres only one or two options on the menu and the staff speaks very little english just get whatever everyone else is getting because its cheap its greasy and its deliciousthis place deserves its star rating based on quality of food for the price it cannot compete in venue atmosphere or presentation to a more expensive restaurant however the food is extremely good and the flavor profile is different than your average meal in this price range its a great alternative to a fast food chain and more filling than a slice of pizza my boyfriend and i split the roast pork and the dumplings from prosperity dumpling for see my other review and felt very satisfied for a late lunch the damage under for a full meal for one
who is the duke of lukes lobster well i am the duke and i enjoyed every last step that brought me to this point there are a lot of choices actually there are a lot of great choices im an economist and therefore concerned with the cheapest way to get the most diverse flavors in my mouth at one timea taste of maine give me a half of all of your three rolls and then throw some extra stuff in thats how you take a visit to maine in a ny second the lightly toasted buttered roll buns grace the nicely chilled lobster shrimp and crabmeat all of which is in itself buttered with a delicious garlic dressing soaked throughout the texture of the meat isnt rubbery but fresh alsowell luke decided all that wasnt enough so he added in a couple claws for a couple more dollars because hes that type of guysigh to be frank that description isnt really doing the best job of describing what luke is selling how do you describe love to a person who has never experienced it see what i mean so that brings me to my suggestionsolutiontake your tail over to lukes lobster and grab a roll or two or three then again just going for a visit to maine isnt a bad idea and if youre rolling as a duet and not solo make it a noahs ark a taste of maine w a discount haha
iconic a must when youre in new york ill keep it short because i know youll visit katzs is good at any time of the day whether its leftovers for breakfast lunch or dinner katzs is amazing i used to take the f train all the way from jamaica queens sometimes by myself fatgirlproblems just to get a sandwich from here its that good some of my favorites pastrami katzs cheesesteak katzs cold sub the macaroni salad and the knishes order any of these or all and youll be super happy
very nice came here with my boss and got the crunchy tuna after he recommended it service is really quick and efficient here and theyre also very kind food is unbelievably fresh and i can definitely see why theyre busy around lunch hour its located in the basement of the atrium for those who cannot find it although i loved the tuna the bread was a little hard to eat in my opinion perhaps its because i just suck at biting bread but if it were on a panini or something easier to bite it would be my all time favorite sandwich the tuna is perfectly mixed with veggies like carrots and peas giving it that crunch it helps to break up that tunay taste that sometimes gets old pretty quickly portion is also pretty filling and its for fresh ingredients what else could you ask for try this place now
ive had many of special moments at this place you cant go wrong on anything they offer but the cookies are the best and i may or may not have had tasted all of them all of them in one single sittingtip come super late and if youre luckythey give you free desserts doubt this is part of their policy but most definately has me coming back at the wee hours of the evening not even sure if this counts as real tip shrugsps i especially enjoy the fact that i can come here at any hr of the day since theyre open so late so late night after drink cravings are always satisfied
i recently took advantage of the opportunity to see one world observatory prior to its actual opening i was excited from the second i chose my tour time everything here is very organized the entrance is separate from the employee entrance which is smart and there is staff everywhere to help you along the way i promise you cannot and will not get lost once youre inside you go down the escalator they check your ticket and you go through tsatype security be prepared to take off your belts and empty your pocketsonce youre through security you wait for the elevator that everyone has been talking about its no joke you get to the floor in a matter of seconds and on the way up you see the city being built from farmland to what it is today your ears will also pop at the end the floor has a small theater where you watch a quick visual of ny today and there is a little surprise at the end i wont give that away you eventually make your way down to the floor which has views meaning you can see the city brooklyn staten island lady liberty etc etc tons of photo ops on all the floors even though it was overcast when we went you could still see pretty far outthere is also the sky portal which you can walk on it looks like you could fall through at any moment so its a bit of a mind fck but its awesome nonetheless there is also a restaurant and a gift shop which i disagree with but whatever if you want to see a beautiful building and experience pretty much all of nyc you should definitely come here once it opens on may also the video in the elevators going down is totally different and if you typically experience motion sickness this might not be for you overall a fantastic way to spend an hour or two
i have passed yuca bar many times and never really looked at the menu until my brother pointed it out once this place is always packed on the weekends and for a good reason my first experience here was on a tuesday where for the two of us ate way more than we can handle they have half off tapas but the tapas are larger than what you would expect we got two orders of guacamole on tues which has about a cup guacamole a cup of salsa and a huge basket of chips so all that times two calamari which was huge looked like two orders at any other restaurant yuca fries which are amazing but are not on the half off menu latina salad which was also not on the half off menu but it was a really good portion and a diet coke a tea which was a lot of food for the pricethe second experience i had here was much better even though the first visit was still good and a really good deal i came here with a couple of friends on a saturday night around we got drinks at the bar for tequila on the rocks while we waited for only about minutes for our table we got guacamole taquitos de pescado salmon ceviche and pulpo ala plancha the high lights were the taquitos and the ceviche i definitely like the dinner menu a lot better here and you can still get the happy hour discount since it goes until it is usually packed but there are a lot of table and you can always get a few drinks at the bar while you wait
time coming here was recently on a friday around as soon as i walked in i fell in love with this establishment i sat at the bar because i was meeting with friends for drinks my bartender was extremely sweet and attentive i never had to track him down to order a drink he was always on top of it i believe his name is jamison but dont quote me on that i ordered the shrimp dumplings which were great i love dumplings so anytime i see them on the menu i have to order them this place fills up fast after this a great spot to grab a drink after work if you work in the flatiron district i would consider it a chic or trendy bar upstairs this establishment has a wine bar that i did not get to check out but will upon my next visit
i actually didnt try any soba here but their yakitori and other food here is surprisingly goodyakitori i tried the liver shishito peppers gizzard chicken skin and all were cooked really well they couldve just a pinch more of salt though smoked mackerel so good ive always loved this dish but its really good here the fish is juicy and fatty and full of smoky salty goodness had to get another orderzaru tofu i really like this but some people might find this a waste of money its light and creamy and comes with ginger and salt but i like it plaingrilled squid nicely cooked not overdone and tendertakowasa the takowasa at hagi was always my favorite but this one tops it it has a ton of flavor and just the right amount of wasabi i like it spicy i liked the radish mixed into the octopus also the octopus was freshi love the ambiance here its not super crowded like other yakitori places and the service is attentive id say its a little more high end here compared to others
im here every other week i am a museum person and let me tell you something no other museum in the world compares to thiseverything is organized chronologically everything is organized neatly and symmetrically everything is taken care of with utter diligence there is a department for everything even for lighting this is my favorite place in the world go up the grand stairs make sure to dont miss out on the egyptian and roman wings look at the wonderful van gogh paintings they are thoughtfully placed with the gauguin ones enjoy the picassos and the monets too dont ignore the period rooms make sure to visit the american wing but dont ignore the tiffany fountain or the tiffany arches take it all in theres something for everybody it is a public museum for those who didnt know you can request to see a piece of art they have in storage and they will show it to you it is also suggested donation put always add a buck or two from what you were initially planning to give it takes a lot to keep such an institution running have you ever seen a da vinci sketch up close the museum will be open late until they say on friday and saturday but they will start closing the galleries and guiding people out earlier so lets call it there will be live music and the great hall bar will be open they have a good selection of wine and cocktails they offer wine flights for the rooftop bar is open but its a weird ambiance with the fake grass and overpriced meh drinks the views are great
summary siggys is a terrific spot for comfort food with gourmet flare smoothies and juices and a menu that offers something for everyone but thatll make vegans and vegetarians especially happy if youve been to siggys original brooklyn location the menu here mostly overlaps with the one there but the space here is maybe two or three times bigger and more stylish though the original location is cozy and a swell space to eat in the new siggys feels more refined somehow more like a restaurant you could come here with friends or family but itd work for casual dates too all the produce used is organic and maybe more importantly all the meat is sourced well eg the beef is pastured infinite plus pointsmisc details the macaroni n cheese is excellent the whole wheat pasta has more body and feels more substantial than plain pasta and the cream cheese sauce turns your mouth into a gooey wonderland my friends and i split this four ways and had it as an appetizer the soupblackeyed peas tomatoes and celerywas equally great its a daily special but if you like hearty vegetable soups and this is available youll like this salmon burger w feta on briochesolid they were two sizeable patties side by side and they paired well with the feta smeared onto the toasted bun i liked this but i hear the turkey burger here is phenomenal and the beef burger is all pasturedbeef as is all the beef served here and i was left wishing id maybe tried one of those the raspberry tart as with the bk location this is the best dessert its crispy tart sweet and leaves you impressed that its vegan its not huge but big enough to split two ways easy or even three or four ways if you want more of an amusebouchey dessert siggys has a small selection of organic beersthe pinkus wheat lager is sweeter than most beers but if youre okay with that its a very good hefeweizen its also the sort of place that has themeappropriate political flyers up in the bathrooms did you know that monsanto is suing vermont because vermont passed a law mandating all gmo foods be labeled as such i did not know this but i do now now you might not worry about genetics and crops reasoning that its silly to worry about any such thing when were all doomed anyway what with the seas rising and the advent of the ai overlords nearly upon us so you might just go to siggys to enjoy wholesome food before that happens and thats okay the politics dont get in the way of the eating
on thai avenue how do you differentiate yourselffirst of all hire a swat team that can deal with regulars and troublemakers alike and empower them to entertain and excel jesse and mai work at their bar and always remember me even though all asians look alikesecond focus on your distinctive characteristics at viv northern thai dishes were the exception rather than the rule but with recent revisions to their menu viv is expanding into an area that isnt well represented in hells kitchenfor best results get anything on their menu preceded by their tom pakard jew its so savory its not funny

if you read one review of this place this has to be itone word omakaselisten up white people take a seat and take notesi couldnt believe what i saw when i walked into neta my friend advised me that neta was an amazing sushi spot to go for omakase and so after my juice cleanse was over i ventured on over to netai walked in and saw all white people what i looked at my friend and asked if he was sure that it was that good not just white peoplewhite people eating rolls rolls wtf likely they were freakin california rolls i was definitely not confident that it would be a great meal im white and listen theres nothing wrong with white people eating at awesome sushi spots but i was just taken aback as usually when i go to authentic sushi spots there are not many white people at all like maxi was also surprised to see a mixologist behind the sushi counter in this small little bar area he made me a great cocktail with soju vodka yuzu juice peychaud bitters and simple syrup it was quite strong and different but very tasty we ordered the omakase chefs choice that had preparedcooked dishes to start cant remember followed by courses of omakase sushi i forgot the exact numbers but whatever you get the pointare you ready to start this magical journey with meprepared dishes leek soup this was like straight out of a starred restaurant it was so well presented that i felt terrible actually eating it honestly see attached photos it was ridiculously good toro tartare with caviar white asparagus salad with miso tofu scallion pur√©e quinoa and pickled radish miso glazed seabass raw fish kara age wok fried lobster with miso and lotus root wagyu beef with king mushrooms i swear i almost damn near fell off my chair when i ate this best piece of meat i have ever consumed in my entire life do i need to repeat this make bold letters and stars when you are taking notes about this legit the best it melted in my mouth mochi rice risotto with uni and truffles is this for real seriously come on guys you can stop trying now the sushi pieces were quite heavenly as well very fresh and very goodwe ended with the peanut butter icecream they must have known that i am obsessed with all things having to do with peanut butter and i can definitely say that i was in heaven for a good hours i was sitting in heavenneta definitely ranks within the top sushi restaurants in nyc in my book and i have been to pretty much all of the top sushi restaurants in the city you must go and also make sure that you sit at the counter and get the omakase trust me its worth every penny
threw my big birthday bash at the winslow and i couldnt be happier with how it turned out pros one of the nicer bar lounges on street with an elegant warm and unpretentious atmosphere winslow is perfect for large parties i reserved the semiprivate room in the back that can hold up to people max when people ended up coming the room obviously became super cramped so many ventured out into the main bar space which was totally fine if i were to do this again with the same number of people i would reserve the additional tables right next to the semiprivate room the best part about the winslow was the excellent service unlike similar lounges like stanton social or verlaines the winslow is one of the few if not only slightly higherend manhattan bars that do not require an initial deposit a crazy minimum charge and one or limited tabs for parties they also offer open bar specials but i decided to go with the easier cashcredit bar keiran one of the managers was so nice and easy to work with he always replied to my emails promptly whenever i had any questions when he mistakenly informed me the happy hour ended at when it was he still kept his promise for my group they were so easygoing that they let me rearrange the furniture in the semiprivate space rory was sweet and friendly and all my friends were happy with how quickly he came back with our drink orders especially when he was our only server throughout the night both kieran and rory made sure to ask me how my friends and i were doing the food here is delicious i ordered several party platters which you order days before your event which my friends loved the winning hors doeuvres that night were the pigs in a blanket goat cheese and fruit compote deviled eggs with crispy bacon grilled cheddar and tomato sandwiches and smoked salmon crumpets the winslow is known more for their gin cocktails i gravitate towards fruitier and sweeter drinks so i loved the garden of eden gin st germaine limelemon happy hour specialscocktail of the day and tonic of the day beer hourcocktails during busy nights frisat they had dj sessions starting around the electronic music was fun and not overthetop brash like dubstep my gf surprised me with a birthday cake and without any extra charge the winslow added big sparkers on top and brought out plates and cutlery for everyone kieran and rory thank you so much for making my birthday so fun and easy

holy moly i need a bigger stomach for my trips to this neighborhood because goa tacos is added to my musteat listparatha tacos are so smart its a large buttery flakey and chewy shell encompassing all the good qualities of naan chinese scallion pancake minus the scallion and phyllo dough its crunchy on the outside yet chewy enough to sop up all the delicious juices without falling aparti got the lamb shoulder which comes with tzatziki sauce and eggplant salsa it was total perfection the shredded lamb was tender juicy and flavorful garlic baby while the sauce gave it a decadent creamy component and the salsa a fresh crunch although it was a single taco i was quite satisfied after finishing it if i didnt have upcoming dinner plans i wouldve wanted to try all the other tacosmy tastebuds are still salivating from the taco as i write this review go there before it gets too packed

woke up one morning and felt like my right ear was stuffed and could not hear so well no other symptoms being your above average neurotic i went to google and read about sudden sensorineural hearing loss basically sudden deafness that comes out of the blue then spent an hour watching youtube clips of doctors removing bugs and other unpleasant things from ears after a day or so with no change i decided that i should probably seek the help of an ent went to castle connolly see my yelp review and started calling doctors luckily i was able to get an appointment with dr rothstein the next day he accepts many different types of insurance after booking the appointment i starting reading patient reviews and was happy to see that they were practically all glowing i thought to myself what are the chances of being able to get a next day appointment with a cc listed doc who accepts my insurance and has universally excellent reviewswent to see the doc the next day great modernclean office located at the nyu langone medical center turned out no bugs just a little impacted wax that he gently removed no pain at all i will be the first to admit im a bit of a doctor snob stellar credentials and a decent bedside manner mean a lot to me i also like to see doctors that have been practicing medicine for a long time but not too long dr rothstein exceeded my expectations in every respect not only does he have a good professional reputation he is a heimishe guy who made me feel very much at ease i highly recommend him if you are in need of an entps the entire consultation i was thinking of this scene youtubedwswnutvsmipps it is a great feeling to be able to hear perfectly out of both my ears again this whole incident has made me appreciate and marvel at how our ears work
this place i grabbed a few magazines and an egg cream here it was worth every penny even if i did have to buy a chocolate bar to meet the cc minimum the service has always been great the egg creams satisfying ive brought along other ny transplants who couldnt comprehend the idea of mixing milk and soda water now they are true believers
aire ancient bathsi am so thrilled i stumbled upon this place upon first walking in we thought wow we are out of our element the fancy lighting and interior design was beautiful but much more than we are used to we checkedin and were given wrist bands that magically opens a locker lockers hold a bathrobe towel and slippers so all you need is your bathing suit what stood out immediately was how friendly helpful and welcoming the staff was there were women working in the locker room making sure we all knew what to do and they brought us down to the pools when we were ready we thought it would be relatively empty as our time slot was pm on a tuesday night but it was fulloh my dear lordthe pools a salt water pool a very hot pool degrees a freezing cold pool with ice chunks degrees a jet whirl pool a pool in back that we called the grotto because it was hidden and dark and cavelike and then the steam room the most incredible steam room ive ever encountered enclosed in a glass room with aromatherapywe tried each pool quickly to figure out which we liked best and then we had two hours to relax float and breathe deeply yes as others have said most people here are couples and people did seem to get very touchy feely which might make some uncomfortable i just ignored them and enjoyed myself we had also booked minute massages which were wonderful and much too short although im glad because that gave us more time to spend in the wonderful pools massage time is included in your twohour time slotthis is the perfect romantic date or special occasion celebration it is very expensive so its perfect for a treat i had the best time and would recommend it to everyone i know book far in advance as they get quite busy
in parerga und paralipomena arthur schopenhauer relates a parable of porcupines huddling together in winter for warmth inevitably pricking each other in the process after several instances of this the porcupines finally settle on a distance wherein their collective heat remains a resource albeit less than ideally but without the fear of being jabbed by one anothers quills this behavioral framework eventually became known as the hedgehogs dilemma and a quote within the parable came to be known as an early reference to mans tendency toward isolationism a man who has some heat in himself prefers to remain outside where he will neither prick other people nor get pricked himselfrebelle and pearl ash are sister restaurants and on first glance at least should by the above parable be inextricably intertwined in their respective bloodstained quills yet somehow in a separation of but a few feet and while sharing a theme the two restaurants remain distinct and each serves to strengthen the other rebelle on its conceptual surface is the sort of inchoate culinary rebellion that entices talented chefs who tire of classical haute cuisine it is not a renouncement of necessary skill but rather a recognition of the creative possibility and risk of a greater degree of freedom serious food in a more casual setting while some may roll their eyes at the idea of yet another per se expat using moderately larger tweezers to arrange moderately smaller plates that isnt the sort of apostasy rebelle incites or contributes to rebelle is instead the closest place to a new wave parisian bistro outside of well paris bistros in paris have gradually come to be reclaimed by a young generation of prodigious talents seeking to deal less in faste and more in fantasque the man chosen to head the kitchen of rebelle daniel eddy formerly the chef at spring in paris was unsurprisingly a figure of that movement it should come as no shock then that a good number of the dishes are cleverly altered renditions of french culinary history and technique beets bourguignon retain the earthy savoriness of the requisite mushrooms and subtle sweetness of the equally obligatory carrots but treads on an altogether lighter plane and rather than mentally prepare you for a long winter it leaves you contemplating the approaching luminance of summer in a nod to the almost fanatical precondition of acceptance of a bistros quality the pork headcheese is a showcase in charcuterie skills of the desserts not ordering the cherry clafoutis would be a mistake yes theyre done by a per se expat no you shouldnt roll your eyeswine much as at pearl ash is unimpeachable as should be expected the list at rebelle skews slightly more french than its predecessor in keeping with the theme that said the sheer breadth of obscurity affordability and amazing finds french or otherwise leave the list at either restaurant as unparalleled in the city the by the glass offerings are reasonably priced and serve as a suitable lens through which to view the list often featuring wines that dont normally see that sort of exposure the sommeliers are much more wellversed in the page tome than is reasonable and like patrick himself are more invested in leading you to what you want to drink than in pushing trends rebelle like its sister before it is the epitome of what small plates restaurants were envisioned capable of cool exciting satisfying and most of all damned good fun vive la r√©sistance

for my review i can say rainbow room is sufficiently worth reviewing after a five year renovation closing rainbow room reopens offering a sunday brunch buffet and monday night a la carte dining with live entertainment in regards to brunch it was certainly one of the most fanciful yet fun white tablecloth brunch buffets i have experienced although i cant take credit for setting one a reservation will prove a bit of a challenge taken days in advance with few openings in betweenforemost the space is simply captivating located on the floor of rock you are surrounded by breathtaking views of the city an adjoining room provides the views alone take this opportunity for many photos vintage chandeliers mirrored walls crystal curtains a circular dance floor plus a live band adorn and surround a large impressive space that resonates a slight touch of contemporary with predominantly classic soft grey colored walls provide a neutral palette for the decorative elements of tastefully done glitz and glamour on to the dining there is simply too much that can be covered in words when it comes to their buffet a degree buffet labeled and separated into sections provides an immense variety you should be here for a good few hours trying a little bit of every thing they offer the buffet consists of but is not limited to a raw bar sushi bar a meat carving station charcuterie of cheese and salumi breads pasta dishes asianinspired dishes pate varieties and truffle and grits there is also a crepes and desserts station to the other side they nearly cover all types of food some dishes were admittedly better than others my favorites the crepes risotto meat carving station truffle and grits and pate section we managed to try a lot yet not all within a span of hours seated around we were officially stuffed by note take your time no one will rush you soak in as much of the experience and try as much of their food you might not get this chance too oftenrainbow room is a truly landmark classy establishment with much to offer when it comes to dining and atmosphere do not neglect to dress to impress hardly pretentious at all as some may think all in all superb time at the rainbow room i would undoubtedly return and recommend others to try

finally after all these years ive found my people as a vietnameseamerican used to having endless options in houston the lack of authentic vietnamese restaurants was one of the things that made fully loving new york so difficult for me in an admittedly divaesque move i literally left the last vietnamese restaurant my friend suggested because it was way too chinese i couldnt even read the menu the vietnamese names for dishes were printed as some sort of subtexttranslation to the chinese name and thank goodness i did because i found this place for the first time since i moved to the city i heard the waitstaff speaking my mother tongue music to my ears we had the grilled pork summer roll goi cuon thit heo nuong to start with thats something i feel like you dont see on menus enough the meat inside was actually warm like they had just grilled it right then then i had a pho t√°i which was nothing mindblowing but still good especially for these brutal ny winters their ch√® ba m√†u is off the chainshaved ice beans green jelly and coconut milk all topped with peanuts what more could you want for a light refreshing dessert best of all they serve avocado boba yall gosh da nangit why isnt this brilliant southeast asian move to make avocado sweet not available wherever tapioca balls are sold i would say the only thing that isnt traditionally vietnamese about this place is that the waitstaff is actually super friendly and the decor is great theres really nothing bad about it now if only we could do something about the black ice and the summer smells then id wholeheartedly love ny

quality italian indeed has quality italiangone three times now to this midtown restaurant and every time i am reminded why i love this place more and more with each visit my favorites are listed below but everything ive had has tasted spectacular yellowtail crudo shishito peperonata lemon so fresh and delicious the shishito pepper gives it a tiny oomph and the fish just melts in your mouth with the simple lemon dressing dryaged porterhouse agnolotti tender pieces of juicy steak wrapped up in house made macaroni probably my favorite pasta on the menu so far but i havent had their lobster fra diavolo yet duhn duhn duhnnnnn qi baked clams probably the best variation of baked clams oreganata i have ever had on each clam they broil on some pieces of capellini so they give the clams a tiny bit of crunchy texture and to make things even more orgasmic they drizzle on a delicious butterlemon reduction sauce table side talk about a taste explosion you know that amazing garlic bread they give you at the beginning save yourself a piece of this and use it to mop of the reduction sauce from this clam dish youll thank me laterquality italian chicken parmigiana for two think of it as a giant pizza pieshaped chicken parm dish served with fresh arugula greens and honey with chili flakes on the side phenomenal if you come with a group i highly recommend sharing this so you can all have a slice without dying from massive food comamy favorite dessert option is the cannoli cart which is prepared tableside with tubes of fresh cannoli cream and freshly baked pastry shells every cannoli should be given to me this way i also love the zagbaglione cream with fresh berries simple yet so goodbesides having delicious variations of your more traditional dishes this place offers exceptional service i love their wait staff they are always so congenial and actually seem to enjoy talking to you about the menu and recommend dishesif you missed my declaration at the beginning i absolutely love this place
ive been to scarpetta at least times during the last couple of years and while i have certainly eaten at more inventive restaurants i am compelled to give it stars largely due to its consistency and the fact that i find myself back here time and time again i have come here on a date with friends and with out of towners and parents reservations are not hard to come by if you are flexible with a or seating and the location is in an easily accessible part of townfirst off the bread is not something to gloss over here while at other places bread almost seems like a formality at scarpetta bread is the first course their famed complimentary stromboli is served warm and with generous chunks of salami and mozzarella i do not remember a single time when i did not ask for seconds and i admit i have gone to scarpetta with precisely the intent of showing my dining companions how great it isappetizers are solid as well but if you are getting just one then it would have to be the polenta it is unbelievably creamy and the mushrooms add a great flavor to the dish scallops are seared well but expensive at for two small ones and you are better off getting the braised short ribs scott conant is most famed for his simple spaghetti dish which i tried on my first visit but not again not to say it wasnt good but i prefer the richness of the duck and foie gras ravioli or the sweetness of the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti my boyfriend and i took my mom and her friend here two weeks ago so we shared several pasta dishes which i thought was the perfect way to try a bit of everything the foie gras ravioli in particular was well received by everyonemains are less exciting than the pastas but the prime sirloin of beef is done very well and a good one to share the black cod is not to be missed eitherif youve left room for dessert the ganache bar and warm banana bread are both personal favorites service is attentive without being intrusive and ambiance is beautiful i definitely will be continuing to visit scarpetta in the years to come
i came here last night on a first date to meet up with for coffee sadly she was a little late and i had a chance to speak to the staff heres what i ascertained this wonderful little coffee shop is brand new at only a month or two old they make all their sandwich meats in house which means roasting the roast beef and all the chicken and what not theyre not using some boars head stuff they do it all there so freshness is never an issue the coffeelatteshot chocolates are all amazing i can attest i had the hot chocolate it was probably the best hot chocolate i had in a long timeheres what i noticed this place is a somewhat of a hidden gem with several large tables and a few small ones its good for hanging out for a few hours or just grab and go the tables are large comfortable the smaller tables are for a pair or so its nice and warm inside and pretty comfortable although maybe id like them to have a little more comfortable seating ideally id like to come back bring my laptop do some work and look like a hipster in this coffeesandwich shop i intend to do that in the near future while working on whatever i need to do on my laptop when i have free time and need to get away from my apartment i just wonder how the staff will take it plus i dont know if they have wifi and mind if you sit there and just buy a coffee and hang out
came for brunch and was going to come here again to really decide if i wanted to give it a i thought about it and you know what yeseverything here hit the nail for me price interior food and service add on for bottomless mimosas freshly made pasta for fresh pasta yes it surprised me i found their lunch menu more interesting you could also customize the pasta type we ordered the brussels sprouts wild boar ragu with pappardelle sausage and pepper with garganelli and eggs benedict and of course the bottomless mimosas the brussels sprouts were crispy and the pancetta pecorino and fuji apples paired well i probably could have ate more plates of it next was the wild boar ragu the pappardelle was thinner than other ones i have had but i actually liked it more like this the wild boar also was not gamey at all which was my initial fear when ordering it it was similar to pulled pork in texture and delicious my boyfriend ordered the sausage and pepper pasta which was also good but actually i dont like bell peppers if you really love bell peppers get that dish i did not get to try the eggs benedict but it did look good hahaservice was excellent they were very friendly and made sure to fill up our mimosas like water even after we paid they encouraged us to stay and drink some more awesomethe only downside of this place is the portions arent too big and their dishes are so yummy that you might end up eating two entrees thats how they get you with the nice prices i guess i dont eat too much so it was the perfect amount for me but i can see it being a problem to people with big appetites if anything get more appetizersyay
credit cards acceptedmy roommate and i were literally the first people in the new xian at this morning when they officially opened for business with free noodles were both ecstatic and mortified there goes our diet that this location is so close to home xian noodles every daythis location compared to some of the older locations of xian is huge the downstairs area hosts an open kitchen where you pick up your food and at least counterbar seats to eat this location even has an upstairs eating area complete with natural lighting through skylights ive since learned that this area is closed unless the downstairs has run out of seating theres plenty of space for everyone to enjoy their food and you wont have to hound people while theyre eating to get a seat like the st marks midtown or chinatown locations the ventilation here is also good and you wont smell like food for the rest of the day after eating here also side note this place isnt full of xian propaganda newspaper articles and tv reruns as the other places areas with the other xians my gotos liang pi cold spicy noodles with gluen chunks if you take it to go make sure you ask for the sauce on the spicy and tingly beef noodles in mt qi pork noodle soup diced pork with a sourstar anise soup spicy pork noodles in soupand anything in soup really the nonsoup versions same order number but without the s is good but i always favor noodle soupsthe handpulled watch them make it noodles here are legit and its hard to find this kind of al dente pulled noodle anywhere else in the cityps takeout xian never tastes as good as when you eat it in the restaurant except for the cold noodlescheers to xian this will definitely be my new goto spot when im lazy to cook
hells kitchen is a new mexican restaurant in the hells kitchen midtown manhattan hence the name the mexican sugar skull art theme sets a trendy ambiance throughout the restaurantwe had large frozen margaritas with trio of guacamole to start avocado grilled pineapple and habanero chile and mint flavors served with tri color crispy corn tortillas it was a perfect appetizer to start the dinner withwe shared the quesadilla braised pork with jack and cheddar cheeses cilantro and salsa in homemade flour tortilla we ordered two tacos the braised short ribs with pumpkin seed guacamole and the grilled tuna with romesco sauce and almonds served with homemade corn tortillas with pickled radish garnishesthis place is great with the right choices of background music and good custumer service a bit pricey for what it is but we will definitely come back for a date night
i forgot to write a review for this new location since it first opened a few weeks ago because i cant stop coming here and eating doughnuts any time i am within a mile radius of iti eat a lot of doughnuts i am pretty sure i have tried every doughnut shop in new york after much research these are without a doubt the best in the entire cityafter several stops at their stand at the smorgasburg locations and at their original storefront in bed stuy i have tried all of the many different flavors they still seem to come up with new ones all the time though i most recently discovered the filled nutella doughnut for the first time here and it blew my mind this one and the other filled ones they have are smaller than the regular giant yeast ones but pack even more flavoryou cant go wrong with any of these but the cafe au lait and dulce de leche are up there as the best of the bunch if you love chocolate then you will love my favorite ones the salted chocolate caramel or the mocha with crushed almonds which are so incredibly rich and chocolatey and gooey that you need to take a bath after eating themyou used to have to go line up at smorgasburg or go to the remote shop in bed stuy to get your hands on these beauties but now not only are they available at this much more accessible location but are also showing up in nearly every coffee shop throughout both manhattan and especially brooklyn they always seem a bit fresher from one of the storefront locations but no matter where you get your hands on these theres no denying how incredible they are
the staff here is so wonderful i came here on a saturday afternoon looking for a comfortable nonpretentious place to drink some coffee and lets not lie a mimosa or two bum some free wifi and work on a little blogging project and hang out i got everything i wanted and was tempted by some waffles along the way as wellat one point i realized id had enough caffeine so switched to decaf refills no problem then i ran out of battery juice and needed to plug in my laptop at the bar no problem then when reaching for my mimosa i knocked over the champagne flute and broke it spilling the rest of my drink all over the bar no problem they were so nice even with all of my bloopers theyll be getting a nice tip and lots of return business from me since i live right around the corner
always a treat i grew up a couple blocks away and practically lived here during high school ive seen many different things here and the other night i saw a lord of the rings symphony while the movie played on a big screen above and behind the orchestra it was so nice to be able to watch the movie and have the music played live this is one of my top favorite movies and im so glad it was done justice by this performance every time ive been here though whether it was for ballet or opera ive always enjoyed the atmosphere and crowd my one and only complaint is that you cant bring a drink inside unless it has a cap that you bought at the bar so i had to chug my mimosa before going in and during intermission

i am highly impressed with how much pride these makeup artists take in their work i was at the yelp holiday hangover cruise last night and pucker was doing touchups for free so of course i decided to sign upi did not expect anything more than a minute touchup maybe some eyeshadow and quick foundation instead i got a fullblown minute session with julio who took his time with me he painstakingly made sure that i looked my best and didnt overlook any detail i seriously felt like he was a true artist who wanted to create the best work possible after he was done i was blown away at the results he made sure the makeup looked natural and even with my super dry skin nothing looked cakey i was so happy i was compelled to give him a huge hug afterwards because of the phenomenal service i received i will be most certainly coming to the studio to get my makeup done for my engagement shoot i took a look at their website and they had very reasonable prices plus complimentary access to a dressing room and shower oh and did i mention they donate of their sales to charity totally in love with this place
i barely give star reviews for clubs just because theres always something to complain about when youre packed into a sardine can or the bathrooms are dirty or theres some gross guy trying to grind on you all night no matter how much you try to get away and theres no where to go but i freakin love this place lol the music is what gets me the stuff you grew up listening to where they got the whole club turnt up singing that old school biggie song that everyone knows the lyrics to then they got that reggae stuff like mr vegas and every girl is droppin it down low and they dont care if you bump them cuz you drop it lower than them too i didnt hear one song all night that i didnt love whoever the dj was is awesome and the drinks were bucks for well drinks for stolis i was expecting bucks to be honest but the pictures make it seem like this place is huge its not at all but who cares i love the music
when i moved to work for a new company i lost my daily dose of brits but thankfully jones wood foundry is close by this has become one of my favorite ues bars because it has great albeit a bit pricey british staples a great selection of beers and the friendliest and most engaging bartenders you can find i havent ventured further into jwf than the bar so i cant and wont provide insight on the vibespace of the dining area but the bar is where you want to be as it allows you to interact with not only the bartenders but regulars who frequent this watering holeive had the burger and the fish chips and may i say both are solid choices that are well worth the price the hefty burger was juicy wellseasoned and cooked to a perfect medium while the fish chips was perfectly light and crispy by far the best burger and fish chips ive had in nyc to date note that they give you malt vinegar to eat with your fries my boyfriend asked for and was denied ketchup jwf keeps it reaaaal britishoverall a great neighborhood spot that has tasty food to be enjoyed in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere jwf will see plenty of me in days to come will update review with my british excoworkers take on jwf pubfare ifwhen that happens

in short in a space along a street in midtown that has undergone many a transformation in its lifetime one can only pray that betony with its michelin star food and service that makes you feel like youre sitting down for a meal in your living room is here to stay for a whilethe story in a world that seems to increasingly seek and embrace the singular superlative title of the best thing i ever ate betony slips quietly into the scene with its purely extraordinary piece of roasted chicken this chicken is undoubtedly the best piece of chicken in new york sliced in a slender triangle and draped with seasonal vegetables like celery root sitting over a decadent jus the chicken is impossibly soft and tender like none i have ever had before managing to occupy a buttery chicken flavor so perfectly fresh and pure at my most recent meal here all four members of our party ordered the chicken and all four cleaned the plate so completely you would have thought it had never seen foodwhile a taste of this signature dish should not be missed several other appetizers and small snacks deserve almost equal praise at the top of this list is the hot foie gras served next to pork belly in a hot ham broth true to the rest of betonys style this piece of foie gras seems so simply executed at first yet the purity of flavors does not belie a handsomely silky rich and perfectly textured bite the radicchio tardivo with beets and robiola bosina is another creamy yet light addition to the meal with entrees ranging from and appetizers from betony is fitting for a superbly special meal that doesnt have to break the bank like a tasting menu easily couldservice is incredibly knowledgeable and calmly prepared to please to perfection for our bread course the pastry chef even prepared a phenomenal piece of glutenfree bread for our resident allergyridden guest and our server was able to tell us the preparation of every dish to astonishing depth its the kind of subtle hospitality that makes a delicious meal even that much more rewardingalthough it stretches across levels with the main dining spaces on the first and upper levels and a private room downstairs the space still manages to feel like an intimate private dining experience in ones own parlour the twotops and fourtops are larger than normal and spaced a good deal apart giving each diner room to both spread out and cozy up in the plush purple velvet banquettes and admire the ornate molded ceiling panels its a space that feels both personal and fantastically regal all at once
the quick its just so much fun prepare to get tipsy and bond with your new best friends while you laugh participate and do something different the details we had the best time at drunk shakespeare last night and already bought tickets for another production the group puts on you walk into this awesome room with walls lined with books and a giant thrones completely transporting you into part of the skit they immediately start you with a delicious shot and from there the booze keeps flowing its a little pricey bottle of wine but worth it booze makes everything more fun i suggest a light pregames to set the mood the actors are talented and hysterical honestly people youd want to hang out with if possible try to sit on the ground level because you participate more in the show and everyone becomes best friends be warned though you might be part of some ridiculous shenanigans that might not be great for a first date or for the prude at heartits a mix of modern pop culture shakespeare and all things ridiculous its something different to do in nyc i highly recommend the damage there is currently a deal on yelp for ive also seen deals on groupon and i believe living social gilt for a fun night out this seems like a good price to me

came here a few months ago when it was juuuuust a tad bit warmer out and i wish i could close my eyes right now and reappear on this amazing rooftop bar i feel like the roof was the underdog of the summer located inside the viceroy hotel you walk inside this beautiful hotel and go up an elevator to the top get out and you feel as though you are walking into a cloud above central park amazing breathtaking views of central park ny skyline and plenty of space to either sit and get cozy or stand by the ledge and dream i found this spot to not be as pretentious as some of the other well known rooftop bars such as fifth bartenders were chill complimentary pretzel bites at the bar decent prices for lambruscochampagne love their matchbook design great spot that i cant wait to return to til next summer
the supershort review lives up to the hype eat here the mediumlength summary review pig khao is fantastic and i couldnt even eat their signature dishes because i usually stay away from pork i mean i had to cut the pig out of pig khao and they still impressed thats pretty great to boot i came here with a proper citizen of the philippines and pk got her thumbs up with one exception the chicken inasal which underwhelmed the both of us id definitely come back id recommend this to outoftowners to friends for dates for lunches for brunches for dinners for winners and i suppose for losers toothey can sit in the sad little heated patio out back and stuff mantou buns not filipino but perfect in about every way in their mouths till their sorrow is forgotten or drowned by doughbeware the menu labeling their small plates arent small the khao soi could easily be most peoples main plate even some of the sidesthe chop suey which was ing delicious by the waywould have made for a pretty great minimalist main in and of itself my partner and i deceived by the menus willynilly categorization overordered and while i was delighted by this in the moment i felt ill shortly thereafter as my dear stomach battled for my very life against the mantou buns which were trying to burst my insides with their doughy assiduous expansion dish by dish sidedishes and appetizers chop suey allegedly a sidedish in actuality also candidate for a very light main or appetizer terrific would have again not filipino but served there often according to my dinner partner who said pks version is way better lighter fresher and not drenched in sauce so the crispiness and flavor of the vegetables comes out mantou buns side dish also not filipino four buns a bit bigger than a doughnut hole and like doughnuts but denser and only very lightly sweet they were perfect i have never had mantou before and i dont know what their ideal is but if their ideal is not this then it either ought to be or i ought to be eating it right now and every day forever and then buried with some of them because they were so good be careful with thesei think they do the thing where they expand in your stomach and threaten you with slow pressured death if you eat too many khao soi allegedly a small plate in actuality a nothuge main this was the best khao soi ive had outside thailand and also the only khao soi ive had that seemed as good as what i remember having there to my palate this dish was also perfectly spicedthere was enough in there to give heat but not enough to overwhelm the flavor or to hurt everything above was not just excellent but it was perfect which is why the main dish was so disappointingmain dishchicken inasal it was chicken just plain old chicken i mean they did something to prep it its skin was colored and has some flavor to it but not to any great effect and my dinner partner mentioned it wasnt as good as what shed sometimes get from the chicken chains of the philippines where it would not only be super cheap but also come loaded with garlic rice in this chickens defense i have to note it tasted better the next day as leftovers perhaps because it didnt have to compete on my palate with all the other stuffdesserthalo halo the best iteration of this dessert ive had the ice was a proper slush not big toothchipping chips and while it was loaded with the mixmix of sweetness youd expect red yam ice cream rice crispies condensed milk and cubes of flan and candied banana it didnt feel overloaded drinksi didnt try the cocktails but i have important beer notes for you the lucky buddha a chinese beer is flavorless effluence poured into a lovely jollybuddhashaped bottle avoid the san miguel pilsner however is a pretty good flavorful pilsner it seems the philippines escaped the trap of exporting only their most generic lager beer
what i love about this free the best cosmo in all of nyc go on friday saturday and sunday evenings because that is when the bartender who makes them works yes i asked him what his shifts swanky leather couches swanky atmosphere swanky overall makes me want to puff on a cigar while i wait for my wife to give birth in the next the waitress was super nice constantly checking up on us for drink refills she gave us complimentary shots at the end of the night whatever whiskey we its right by the nqr train on central park south for the location the price isnt too did i mention free the pool table was well maintained unlike the one in dumbo that looked and felt like it was about to disintegrate no missing balls table was tilted in anyway making it impossible to sink any shot and the stick were not on the wrong side of crappy highly recommend will be frequenting here after work on fridays from now on free pool
sake bar hagi is one of my dependable standbys ive been coming here for years lowkey dates catching up with friends and even solo dining this bar has always got me coveredreasonable prices service is always on point and if you go early or laaaate enough you wont have to deal with a waittheir menu covers the gamut of what youd expect at a japanese bar light bites galore the tofu agedashi is a good warm up and then you can move onto skewers who doesnt like yakitori and if you have a hankering for ramen late nights yes theyve got ramen theyll save you a walk to a specialty noodle shop most which will be closed by then and itll fill you uptheres a tv if youre into that and plenty of alcohol if youre into that and seating for a decent group so youll never be bored
easily one of the top beer shops in all of nyc huge variety of beer in every price range style origin you can think of warehouse style place you can mix and match packs buy as many or few bottles as you want of each beer bottles are priced individually so you can pick and choose they also have a small selection of taps its a bit out of the way so make a day trip out of it and hit some good restaurants and shops in the area staff were very helpful large selection of local and regional beers from all around the us lots of stuff i had never heard of and lots i was very familiar with great selection of ipas farmhouses saisons hefs lagers ales etc small selection of sours as well you pay at the window which isnt quite traditional but it works came here and spent about on a large selection of beer even got some advice from two guys who were shoppers and looking at some similar beers nice folks i will definitely be coming here again next time im in the area or have a hankering for some unusual beers
as a guy id rate new clothing shopping slightly above going in for a dental cleaning which im overdue for so after a large shopping spree at macys on i found myself with two pairs of new jeans unfortunately for me god did not make me a length that agrees with most traditional jean sizes leaving me in the precarious position of needing to get them hemmed dating back to my days living in north jersey it was relatively cheap and easy to find a place to get this done every town had a few laundromats or tailorshey i know its new york city there are plenty of places to get your jeans hemmed however the prices shocked me during my initial local search in my neighborhood greenwich village they wanted to charge me dollars per pair the horrori decided to take matters into my own hands and went on yelp and found this little east village gem i called in advance and found out with their coupon on here and by checking in you can get original stitched jeans hemmed for dollars no its not a typo these are oldschool new york city prices i arrived there on a chilly wednesday after walking more than a mile the lengths we go to save dollars in manhattan and chuckled as i saw they posted a list of peoples faces via video surveillance who had shop lifted as a way to shame them bad very bad people who did that i digress after entering the large store with rows of clothes and large lights reminiscent of a fashion runway i was greeted by air a very friendly receptionist who explained to me the different types of hemming available didnt know there was more than one before and also suggested to me using the yelp coupon code on my phone app which was very nice of her i had her put pins on the bottom of the jeans as they were bootcut and needed to be cut just enough to not scrape the ground she told me they would be ready in days and even suggested me a coffee spot down the street i reviewed it too yay after days she called and told me they were ready so i strolled back before heading to a yelp event also reviewed it im on a roll here and i went back in and tried the newly hemmed jeans on they were cut to exactly where id have wanted not so long that they were touching the bottom of my shoes but not so short that youd see my socks if i sat down in other words they were hemmed to hit that magical sweet spot that so few hemmed jeans ever reach and the original stitching was still in place successful plastic surgery of my jeans was completed i thanked air switched my frumpy pants for one of the newly hemmed jeans and headed out feeling great suffice to say i would recommend other yelpers come here for any of their hemming or tailoring needs as this store is simply cut from a different cloth

this place is like the great gatsby movie on steroids what this type of barloungeclub whatever exists in real life i have had an intense love affair with nyc for years and i just recently came to this glorious nightlife establishment now oh of my friends and i do our ritual dinnerdrinksclub night like mmm once every few weeks we wanted to try some place new that all of us have never been to the top of the standard or boom boom room as it was formerly known got thrown around in conversation and while i tried to get the hookup from some of my promoter friends aka get us a table stat they were unable to do so even though we were willing to shell out thousands of dollars hmm impressivefinally a friend of a friend you know the drill knew someone and alas we reserved a table the hostesses are dressed inwait for itwait for itlike something out of the great gatsby movie you walk in to this super swanky gorgeous nightclub where it isnt so packed that you can feel the sweat dripping off of the person next to you no no no no no we had our own little table and it was only appropriate to order dom like literally it would be a shame to drink something regular this is not a regular place be prepared for a luxurious evening where good service actually exists in a nightclub and people around you actually smile no one will spill a drink on you and you will not wake up in the morning smelling like you bathed in cigarettes wow definitely had a lovely evening and want to return asapi think they may be a little too strict at the door as this place has so much potential to be like the it club but they make it very hard to get in to when they say guest list only they mean it no bs its hard to reserve a table here but honestly its worth all the trouble if you can actually get a resothis review was for the club experience after
my review used to say i come here every tuesday and thursday but a few people as well as my scale brought it to my attention that i am here almost every day i try to restrain from the sweets and walk to the back where the coffee bar is they do not have almond milk but they do have soymilk so soy cappucino it is the walk back is the hardest part because by that time you are completely surround by the delicious smell of pastries and chocolate and you have to walk past all the delicious offerings and i give in of the time my favorite thing here is the chocolate rugelach it is flakey and the perfect sweetness i grew up in israel where rugelach are extremely common so naturally i have had some amazing ones but this is one of the best ones i have tasted you can get one or you can get and it is a better price or something but honestly i would still buy these if they were a piece the breads here are delicious too i bought two focaccia breads seeded and roasted vegetable i like the seeded much better because it has a nice crunch to it but both were really delicious the rolls sesame or poppy are really soft on the inside and only the jerusalem baguette reminds me of the ones i used to get in israel but with higher quality ingredients the babka is amazing as well and i would highly recommend buying one though you can only buy it as a whole which for someone like myself is extremely dangerous because i am more than able to finish a whole loaf honestly anything chocolate here is mind blowing the almond croissant is also a really good choice if you are craving sweets it kind of reminds me of a cronut in the sense that it is really crunch on the edges but super soft inside it also has marzipan inside which is one of my favorite things in the world it is super filling so i would recommend sharing it the potato burekas are also good but that was my favorite thing as a kid and it feels like a sin to eat them anywhere else except roladin a bakery in israel the spinach feta are the best ones here in my opinioni recently tried three of the hamantashens the vanilla chocolate chip chocolate nutella and poppy seed my favorite of the three is the vanilla chocolate chip the vanilla is almost like a puddingcustard texture which i really enjoy the poppy seed is also really good but there is a lot of poppy filling so if that is not something you like try the vanilla the chocolate was a little too chocolatey for me which surprised me because i thought it would be my favorite this place is a little pricey they give student discounts if you are a student but everything i have tried here was amazing and it is worth it
seriously you must try this place it was spectacular aside from having a cozy atmosphere the food and service were phenomenal my friend and i opted to order and split the bibimbap with spicy chicken and the le grand bulgolgi i probably liked the le grand bulgogi a bit more but the bibimbap was tasty as well the bulgogi is chefs cut prime beef ribeye marinated in korean barbecue sauce grilled on open fire served with kimchi and brussels sprouts the barbecue sauce has a nice mesquite flavor the steak should be eaten completely together with the kimchi and brussels sprouts for an absolute perfect bite the bulgogi which we ordered medium rare was tender melt in your mouth perfection the bibimbap with spicy chicken was served with a bowl of rice with bean sprouts zucchini shiitake mushroom julienned carrots seaweed chips gochujang a red chili sauce and a fried egg you mix everything together yourself for a really nice portion of bibimbap it was a nice blend of flavors for dessert we opted for the green tea pudding if you like the flavor of green tea ice cream youll definitely enjoy this its served in a shooter and topped with house made whipped cream and a cookie crumble the pudding is not too heavy or sweet so i left feeling like i could still fit in my clothes just a note although our dishes came out at the same time at the tables to the left and right of us their food was served at different times it would be nice if the restaurant could address this issue either way dont let that deter you from coming here
went on a friday night around i had read an article about this restaurant and been meaning to try it out the dining area seats over hundred and the wait time for a table was only about minutes when you first come in you will notice the huge tank which hold exceptionally large lobsters i am talking pound lobsters insane you also notice the huge beautiful bar they literally had at least bartenders i knew i could truly appreciate this establishment because it is properly staff as soon as we were seated we were introduced to our server i ordered a glass of wine to go along with my dinner as wellthere menu has three things whole lobster steamed or grilledlobster roll burger each comes with fries and a salad this is not a place you bring your vegan friend to lolour food came out in less than minutes and was delivered on a silver platter i ordered the grilled whole lobster with lemon butter my husband order steamed i think the grilled lobster is better and less messy in terms of the tomalley of the lobster i am not a fan of the tomalley and that is why i order it grilled the lobster tasted great the salad was pretty basic the fries are pretty addictingi will definitely be revisiting this establishment soon its is a great deal for the amount and quality of food you receive
corners latest outpost extends into chinatown replacing the outgoing beleaguered orange teahouse time will tell how they fare against the glut of chinese coffee shops and bakeries in chinatown but one thing is clear service and premium coffee drinks youve come to expect from the sister shop on east broadway are here as wellas you may well know the younger demographic will be right at home here as they do at the e broadway location for which ive grown fond of since their openingthey have free wifi and a few seats to enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend though much like the e broadway location it too is quite a tight space i ordered a cappuccino and did some work on the counter space and sure enough customers are already coming through thats coffee for yaif you enjoy premium brews besides starbucks and you happen to be in chinatown make this yours
veselka is forever a horoshayiememory in my mindfirst time ive stepped into the ny streets i stayed at a couples apartment arranged through airbnb completely new to the city and hungry after a hour flight i asked them for a suggestion for late lunchgo to veselka its just down a few blocks we go there with friends often great ukrainian dinerwith this advice from mere strangers i waltzed down the street picturing myself as a petite carrie the things watching too much satc before flying out will do to ya the corner diner was packed but as i had arrived alone i decided to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen i ordered blintzes with the works my hunger mixed with happiness of being in the city didnt register that it would be too much food it was delicious i think i drank a cup of coffee as well which is a must for any diner visit for me the service was quick the food deliciouswhen my mom who was born in ukraine visited we went here on a whim again we sat at the bar this time we ordered pierogi and borsht and a few other things as someone who has russian blood but has never made borsht from scratch i sure am picky i actually judge ukrainianrussian restaurants by their quality of this hot staple the red beet soup flavored with beef with a dollop of sour cream on top oh yeahit was a bowl of deliciousness that i couldnt get enough of in fact i swore id visit again and again and again in the winter months to be warmed by the goodness cant wait to be back love this place rus good
remember that time i almost burned down the bar by catching the paper napkin on fire yeah me eitherbut seriously minus that little snafu i love everything about this place i been a couple of times and have had fabulous service every time whether im sitting at the bar or with a large party at a table the service has been way above par all of the cocktails ive had are fresh and delicious their happy hour is great and can you really go wrong with a solid cheap burger and wings nope great new addition to the neighborhood
dalishso i have been in a bit of a foodie funk lately everything seems mediocre everything its pretty upsetting enter maysville on a friday night i was meeting my friend lea for drinks and we chose maysville for the location and the intense bourbon selection we had read about i met her right at on the dot and my word was it crowded there was absolutely nowhere to sit at the bar nowhere to stand either so we decided to order an appetizer or two and snag a table we were seated at a super tight little table in the actual bar area which i didnt love after our first drink arrived though it was all good baby i had the noreaster whiskey ginger beer maple syrup lime my stomach had been a bit upset that day so i thought the ginger beer would really help a sister out booze logic hot damn this was one banginass drink for realsies come here just for this alone delicious we looked over the menu a few times and had a hard time choosing what to have my friend doesnt eat pork why she agreed to go there i will never understand and most of the dishes are based around glorious delectable pork anyway im not one for wallowing and we were already there soshrimp toasts celery and ginger aioli were excellent i was especially glad these came before any other dishes they were robust but alsodelicate i just dont think they would have been as good after some of the heavier dishes grilled flatbread brussel sprouts buttermilk sheeps milk cheese and crispy pig ear so good i mean it was likely one of the healthiest dishes hahah joke on the menu and it was really good the brussel sprouts were all shaved and drizzled in cheese the flatbread was a nice balance between soft and crispy and we had the crispy pig ear on the side to accommodate my friend but there was no way i was going to give that ish up it looked like teeny tiny slices of chicken cutlet it was salty and delicious i especially liked the flavor of the ear with the brussel sprouts dont let the fact that its pig ear scare you it doesnt look like an ear and if thats what ear tastes like bring me more we also went with the mushroom tart whipped ricotta cheese and pickled apple which was honestly just okay but you dont come to maysville for their mushrooms now do you i think not best part of the whole meal the cornbread they serve in lieu of a bread basket for the two of us we recieved four slices of steaming hot cornbread with soft butter which obviously melted all over the bread before the entire thing melted in my mouth we even had seconds yes seconds on the bread basket bring me thirds as for the space itself it was really gorgeous it walked a fine line between being too girly or too masculine with somehow striking the perfect balance between the two massive photographs of horses on the walls a carrera marble bar and warm lighting throughout including a wall of whiskey and bourbon all softly backlit to catch your attention but not take away from your dinner companion even the wallpaper has a golden glow which balances nicely with the wood and steel barstools you know i am a sucker for a nice space anyway have you been no well thats a tremendous mistake get thee to maysville have the pork and bourbon

i dont eat chinese food too often as my taste buds dont have a liking for this cuisine but wait before you call me an asian hater i can explain i am not one of those chinese americans thats too snobby for my own peoples food thats hardly the case its more like i am a health nut and well chinese food is basically heart attack on a platter but after an extremely grueling bikram class right upstairs me and my homegirls needed desperately to restart our engines bikram yoga will kill you but you will appreciate it later so all the glowing reviews for this place is for the cracklin chicken and well if you eat birds of the fowl family you have got to get this dish it comes with about to pieces of large chicken pieces fried to perfection the pieces are seriously as big as a small bird on top of that it comes with fried rice soup of your choice and salad and all this food is for since i dont eat meat i got the tofu szechuan style served with a side of fried rice an order of plantains and soup of your choice and all this for my other friend got the general tso shrimp with side of yellow rice this was ill have to tell you when the waiters brought out a dish of egg noodle chips with a side of duck sauce i just couldnt stop smiling it just brought back so many good memories of when i was a child and going out to eat with my family those were some of my happiest moments we ladies enjoyed our meals chatted about life catching up and enjoying our adventure into a time warp the restaurant looks like its right out of the with a diner top in the front of the restaurant with the coolest stools thats right hipster is in and they have a few tables with booth seating and of course very tacky wall art that is a quintessential chinese restaurant ambiance which i took in with fondness the waiters were very nice smiling all the time and speaking three different languages while working quickly to serve everyone we came in at and despite them closing at they allowed us to enjoy a most relaxing meal and the waiters never rushed us and let us take our time i will definitely come back again for other tofu dishes served with plantains this is my goto now after a crazyass bikram class never mind that i also thought the waiters were exceptionally cute and adorable wink wink

this place is the bomb there was literally one other couple when i got here pm on a sunday the place is small and spotless and the waitress took our order quickly i ordered the dancing spicy ramen and my boyfriend ordered the california ramen i actually thought the california ramen wasnt so great but he really liked it its got this weird tomato broth thats kind of refreshing if youre into that kind of thingi wanted thick creamy garlicy ramen which is exactly what i got the calamari was delicious and fit in surprisingly well even though i thought it was an odd choice when i ordered it the broth was filling perfectly salty super savoryi definitely want to come back and try a few other things on the menu they have an awesome lunch special that i missed i believe it comes with a free side and salad this is a great inexpensive alternative to ippudo and totto that can get you in and out in minutes

words cant even begin to explain how much i loved my dining experience at the musket room i heard from a friend that they had an amazing tasting menu for an affordable price and they were able to snag a michelin star within the first year of opening all these accolades are exactly on pointto start the service here is impeccable when we arrived at our reservation our hostess was very apologetic about making us wait and she offered to buy us drinks we opted for the smoky kiss and the queens punch among the two the queens punch was the better drink with a little less of an alcoholic aftertastewhen we were finally seated we chose the tasting menu while we were waiting our server gave us a choice of a couple different breads sourdough bacon and cheddar brioche and rye like any starving individual i stopped listening when our server said bacon and ordered the brioche immediately amazinggggg we asked for seconds and thirds throughout the night and our server happily obliged the sourdough was pretty good as well but no contest for the briocheour dishes were paced perfectly and in this order broccoli soup oxtail parsley the oxtail croquette was so delicious be sure to savor this one the broccoli soup was a great appetizer for a cold night it was thick and had great texture without being too heavy cold smoked scallops cucumbers black garlic pears sea beans this dish had the best presentation it was served with smoke bubbling underneath a glass cover and when the server lifted the glass the smoke dissipated into the air drawing the attention of other patrons sitting near us the rolls of pickled cucumber here were my favorite everything on this dish complemented each other perfectly quail blackberries bread sauce roasted onions i havent had quail too many times before this but i really enjoyed this one the bread sauce was very unique and tasted great with the tender quail which fell right off the bone i only wish there was more meat new zealand red deer flavors of gin this was my favorite dish of the night the red deer was cooked perfectly and did not have a gamey taste to it at all the portions looked small at first but as i was eating this one it didnt feel that way at all i think it was just the right portion to satiate an appetite without being overwhelming grape ginger this was a really interesting palate cleanser i liked how at certain parts it tasted somewhat like a peanut butter jelly sandwich it was bright and sweet without being too overly saccharine chocolate mousse cake pear almond i wasnt a huge fan of this dessert but it was still pretty good im big on textures so i really appreciated the medley of flavors and combination of textures on this platethis is probably one of my best dining experiences in nyc and i will definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone the musket room has definitely set a high bar for new zealand cuisine in my book
im sure the reviews speak for themselves about how great this place is but what i do want to share is that despite the receipts you see on here yasuda has one of the best deals around for high quality sushiespecially after spending weeks eating my way through japan this summer i realized how lucky i was to be able to find similar quality sushi at my doorstepwhile you can opt to get the omakase which dont get me wrong is fantastic if you dont want to spend you can also do the following assuming splitting between people orders of sushi matsu pieces of sushi and half a roll each for per person sashimi take varieties of sashimi you can order extra piece so that you get pieces each for order a few special pieces that arent on the set menu i always like to get an addition piece or two of uniand that brings you to just under per persontip do try and get a counter seat if you can regardless of if youre doing omakase or a la carte it lets you talk to the chef about your likes and dislikes and he can adjust the pieces as you go im often unfamiliar with half the fish on the menu so i tell the chef to surprise me
with so many thai restaurants sprouting all over nyc like mushrooms it is always amazing to stumble upon the ones that stand outsomtum der offers a fantastic thai isan cuisine northern partspicy the long communal tables and the sai fish traps hanging on the ceiling speak truly of a thai ambiancesince its family style dining we started with pad thai mun poo its a special pad thai made with crab meat and crab paste with home style sauce its so delicious and it disappeared on our table with a blink of an eye next was the papaya salad tum pooplara it is isan salad with fermented fish sauce and field crabs unfortunately the taste was too pungent for our americanized palate the waiter incidentally over heard us and was kind enough to offer to replace with another salad called tum thai kai kem spicy salad with salted egg star for thatthe fried isan sausages sai krok isan were simply epicurean the grilled coconut marinated beef skewer moo ping kati sod with sticky rice on the side made our dinner sumptuouswith top notch customer service and its inexpensiveness the competitors near by should really be worried
never mind the pies and the thighs these doughnuts are insaneactually the pies and thighs are pretty awesome too but make sure you also get every doughnut especially the butter crunch but especially the chocolate but especially the new sourdough this location is way better than the tiny original in williamsburg still the elementary school chairs but theres a lot more room now as well as a counter
yes the cronut is good but their other pastries and even their lunch items are just as good if not better the only cronut variety ive tried was their pumpkin chai it was good and i only had to wait in line for about an hour but it really doesnt live up to the insane hype their current seasonal menu offers a gingerbread croissant which is far superior its perfectly flaky and comes cut in half having been stuffed with toasted pecans a caramel coulant and topped with marshmallows and powdered sugar its seriously good and requires no waitive also had a few of their savory menu items as well the perfect little egg sandwich is just that perfect fluffy and delicious its served on a warm fresh brioche bun and comes with gruyere cheese its an awesome snack and a great pairing if youre looking for something to offset the sugar coma for a more heavier savory option their mustard braised cabbage burrata panini is also a decent vegetarian choice although the egg sandwich is better the secret is their soup though the parsnip and cauliflower soup is delicious and its served with homemade cheese goug√®re one of the best breads my tastebuds have ever encountered just get the soup you wont regret it unfortunately this place is super touristy and can get really crowded but they have ample amount of seating with a back patio garden there is always a line but it moves pretty quick and somehow the employees stay pretty nice despite the daily insanity venture out from the cronut theres more to this great little bakery

pros awesome food awesome view overlooking columbus circle awrsome service souvenirs to take home a print out of your menu with some personalized phrases like happy anniversary lindsey and daniel their cookies in cute little tin boxes with per se logo on top and a tour of the kitchencons getting the reservation is a bit trickyso i came here for my yr anniversary dinner and i had an amazing experience this was exactly why we chose this as our anniversary dinner place we opted for one tasting menu without incurring additional costs and one with all of the additional options added and added one red and one rose the whole meal came to including dollar tip for the waiter btw the tasting menu price is inclusive of the taxes and tips no need to tip we just did because he shaved extra truffles for our pasta heheits useless to talk about the menu itself since they change everyday one thing they dont change is the oyster pearls which is a classic here after one bite i understood why this is the un changing dish at per se waiting service is impeccable the waiter was very attentive and actually offered to shave off a very generous portion of extra truffle on our pasta dish it was beautiful to see piles and piles of shaved truffles a mounting on top of my pasta the whole experience took us about hrs and while we were eating we watched the sun goes down the columbus circle very romantic oh btw if you ask them for a tour in the kitchen they gladly show you around and we got a chance to say hi to the chef it was so much fun this place is just once in a lifetime experience
so were sitting in his car after my brunch shift and he was like i want foie gras and escargot what are the odds that a restaurant that offers both was in walking distance only in new york city voila amelie also the name of my favorite movie i had walked past this restaurant many times in my old days of living in manhattan so we stopped in and it was packed the staff all spoke lovely french and added to the authentic flair of this modern french restaurant they worked hard to seat people as quickly and efficiently as possible in such a tiny space the wine selection was amazing and they had excellent happy hour specials the lighting was dim and the atmosphere intimate we tried the escargot and it was shockingly nice also sopping up the delicious garlic parsley sauce with the fresh bread was half of the fun i had the smoked salmonavocado salad i couldnt have anything heavy that day for some reason and he had the duck confit both were excellent and the wine pairings were on point in my crazed hastiness to get some bread from the bread basket ok fine i had also had a bit of wine i accidentally knocked over my wine glass and it shattered the waiters were so sweet about the accident was there wine in it no i drank it all oh good thats the important part i offered to clean up the mess since i am a server at another restaurant of course they did not allow me to but at the end of our meal the waiter ran over and gave me a dollar tip for your services he grinned ah im in love je vais revenir
one imaginary teardrop rolls slowly down my right cheek sniffs it is a joy experienced while simultaneously reflecting on the triumph over hardship im aiming to give a glimpse of the feeling i had when i learned patacon pisao had finally opened in lesthe struggletyping p a t on my browser is automatically completed by pataconpisaonyccom ive gone to that site countless times with wishes not to see the neon red coming soon sign it never happened then what feeling more adventurous and hoping i was being deceived by the website not being updated also led to me randomly jumping on citibikes to make the small trek to essex first to see where renovation was on the property and then in hopes the place would surprise me and be open i have no idea how many times ive made that trip with the sole purpose of grabbing a cachapa its a good thing i have an annual citibike membership the temperature was hot tepid cool cold frigid brisk warm and sweltering again i remember doing google searches for any article that might shed some light on the magical opening date that changed over and over again i remember peering in and seeing the long wooden bench on the side of one wall and stainless steal metal seats on the other to match the stainless steel tabletops i remember seeing the sign being excited and posting a storefront picture on yelp i remember being equally thrilled when i saw the sign saying we are hiring all just toying with my emotions sniffs again this is bitter sweet after over a year the time had finally comeahhhhhh it was delightful to sit in the energetic contemporarily decorated small restaurant on essex as the nice cool breeze rushed in through the retractable front windows the other night its a friendly relaxed casual hip spacethe staff was attentive sociable appreciative pleasant enthusiastic and helpful with recommendations for customers clearly i knew what i was gettingi had my fav the la gorda cachapa and a ginger beer a friend had a shredded beef patacon and jarritos while we both shared some tequenos cheese wrapped in doughas expected everything was great just as i recalled it always being on all my other visits to patacon pisao in inwood and elmhurst both the shredded beef patacon and la gourda cachapa were certified by my colombian friend who has eaten both on many occasions while visiting colombia colombian names differ i think that lends more cred to the food at patacon pisao than i can considering i was just recently introduced to colombian and venezuelan foodcachapas sweet corn bread like cake sandwichespatacons hardened and flattened green plantain sandwichesarepas white corn meal pattieslots of flavor regardlessthe tequenos are extremely popular at the inwood location and should be tried with the lightly spiced pink sauce they also have several ethnic flavored drinks to go along with the experiencethe neighborhood spot has great tasting food not found anywhere else in the area and should be a hit you would be doing yourself a huge favor to go check them out lastly please read the warning belowdisclaimer i am not held responsible for unwanted weight gain and irresponsible consumption of frequent large amounts of food from essex

okay people take a seat and listen up i am like a little kid going to the dentist when it comes to hair salons finding new salons scare the pants off of i have a black streak birthmark in my hair that literally every hair stylist says to me they have never seen before which can turn orange or break off easily so the color that one uses must be top of the tend to never know exactly what you want it doesnt matter how many pictures or explanations you give them they always tend to mess it up hate getting my hair done and on the phone hear the dreadful and up and then you get done with your hair and its like the amount you thought it would be and you just had a notsogreat experience at the salon but leave spending likerent money therei just moved back to nyc from miami where the salons werent exactly the best i did find one or two that i liked but didnt looooooooove i havent had an oh wow my hair looks da bomb moment in many many many many many yearsi did my research extensively online i tend to stick with aveda salons because the color works great for my hair however i wanted to get my hair done saturday morning and all aveda salons were booked i did some googling and found an article on racked about whistle then i came to my trusted yelp to verify this article and alas saw the heavenly yelp reviews i called exactly when they opened at am on saturday morning and asked to get an appointment for a half a head of highlights and a blowdry she said and up the dreadful words i was like ughhhh fine ill go in and try iteric was my colorist and even though i read on the website he is an apprentice or something which made me so skeptical because of my previous experiences i still decided to be brave and give it a shot i explained to him that countless times before i have told colorists i want my hair blonde blonde only to be left with ashy dirty blonde hair he said he would make me golden and he would definitely do his bestummmmmmmmmm drum roll pleasethis freakin salon rocks like what my hair came out the best its ever looked my blonde goldy locks look perfect i was like staring in the mirror today trying to find somethinganything wrong with my hair and i cantfindanythingwrong this is definitely going to be my goto spot he did a ridiculous job and how much was it for the and up service you ask half a head of highlights included
dinner tasting menu review fall had a friend come into town and of course he wanted to try a daniel boulud restaurant with only a couple days ahead of time we were able to secure a spot for two at cafe boulud thankfully at at this place is still very bustling our table had a min delay which was one of the few downsides so we hung out at bar pleiades next doorwe were seated side by side by the wall allowing us to people watch while we ate our dinner we were probably the youngest people there decor of the restaurant is lovely but i will say that towards the end of the night the very powerful heater kicked on and i was literally sweating just sitting still because it was so hot and uncomfortable not enjoyable at all but by that point at least we were ready to leavewe did the tasting menu with a few drinks in between as recommended by the waiter best decision ever i loved the fact that instead of bringing us both the same dishes every course we each got a different one essentially a course tasting menu turned into and i was beyond ecstatic im not sure if this is always the case so i would check with the waiter firstim not going to go into detail about each dish but they were all tasteful and well worth the price especially since you basically get to taste the menu if you go as two notables olive bread you get to choose out of multple kinds on tray but the olive bread is for sure the tastiest amuse bouche everything was delicious chefs choice of nz venison never had anything like this before and the oatsseasoning on this is just absolutely amazing chestnut veloute oh my god dessert all of itservice was of course amazing and the waiter made sure to explain each and every dish we got and even stuck around to chit chat when we had questions about the food or wine staff is quite knowledgable on the dishes and drinksif i return to cafe boulud and do a la carte my gotos would be the foie gras chestnut veloute vension and marrakesh delight seasonal dessert but the thyme creme brulee was good as well
like lorey y ive been entrusting my styling and hair health to ray for years ive stayed with him through various highend boutique salons and will happily follow him wherever he goeswhy because i have notoriously hardtocut hairand can count on one hand how many stylists have done my head justice throughout my entire lifetime im also getting olderand thinner on topnot only did ray bring my hair to health he has kept it there all these years and has made adjustments to help compliment me as i age i always leave feeling and looking more youthful very refreshed and have a grand time laughing and chatting through every sitting and man oh man can this gent give one grand head massageive also sent various managers from my office to him all have different hair types and all were thoroughly pleased the most impressive was a female manager who received a horrid cut dye job ray saved her she looked stunning after he was done working his magic with people complimenting her left and rightyoull be in good hands folks
beads of sweat are rolling down your cheek thoughts of panic are racing through your mind you hastily run through the items from a mental checklist youve swiftly strung together first remember to add the garnish second wipe off the excess drops of sauce that eagerly dripped from your ladle and splashed onto the barren white plate that is your canvas time is quickly running out and before you know it youre down to the last few seconds of the clock boom time is upclearly if you can crank out amazing dishes under intense pressure you can only begin to imagine the quality plates top chef season winner harold dieterle can assemble under ample time shortly after his win he opened perilla located in the west side despite its rampant growth in popularity perilla has remained modest the decor strays from opulence and is instead enhanced with tasteful simplicity the lighting is resplendent and brilliantly golden altogether perilla presents a very charismatic and handsome atmosphere perilla has a menu full of fine fresh american fare the ingredients are heavily dependent on what is locally available and thus the menu seasonally changes the menu clearly reflects dieterles love affair with asian ingredients the menu is embellished with vibrant asian notes basil kimchi black sesame and bok choy a separate menu was created for new york restaurant week steamed mussels are the perfect appetite primer they are steamed and tossed in rings of saut√©ed yellow onions the mussels are topped with a coarse mixture of garlic bread crumbs for a satisfying texture and bathed in a creamy stock minuscule pieces of tasso ham are also sprinkled onto the dish for a smoky flavor this was swiftly followed by the roasted all natural chicken this features a thick slab of chicken breast served over a bed of pearl barley the skin was perfectly salted and crispy the breast was oozing with au jus this entree playfully incorporates the flavors of roasted peaches coriander cumin and fresh chilies all desserts are designed by laura jackson the panna cotta unites an eclectic combination of flavors lime jalape√±os and gooey melted caramel it is adorned with cereallike puffs of amaranth for a delightful crunch my favorite element of the dessert was the sweet sorbet that was transformed from watermelon juice perillas wine list is extensive i ordered a glass of sherry valdespino contrabandista amontillado it has a deep nutty flavor with strong accents of plum i definitely recommend this for people who enjoy fruity concentrated and medium dry winesome pro tips cards are accepted restrooms are a little small but wellkept perilla features booths that are appropriate for larger parties there is a bar large enough to seat comfortably in the first half of the restaurant the staff was extremely welcoming and the service was spotless throughout the night
the other night was my birthday so i reserved a table of which just also is the biggest table they have for a big and fun chinese ayce all you can eat hot pot a handful of my coworkers and some friends from around the neighborhood swung by for the reservation yes they take reservations with that said they do take reservations and if you book early enough you can book out all semi private rooms that can each hold about comfortably so think of a party of like can be seated and hanging out all having a good timealso its byob they dont have a liquor license yet so they arent serving alcohol but if you feel like you want to drink you can bring your own not sure if there are any liquor stores near by but if you want to bring beers wines liquors etc you definitely canthe hot pot is great all you can eat except for some premium stuff on the bottom but really you dont need all that just pick and choose what you want and youll get everything in a timely fashion there is usually a hour time limit but if you have a big group and if they arent busy they wont bother you just make sure you know what youre getting in terms of soup bases just know that the spicy style is sechuan spicy with the pepper corns that have that numbing spicyness they do have a kim chi version as well
not much to be said here that hasnt been said just a few try to avoid the seating its the last bar seating and at this point nakazawasan will no longer ask if you want additional pieces after your omakase we wanted an extra uni and toro piece but could not get em he also didnt ask us to pick an urchin to open up for our uni piecei suspect this only occurs during the first seating but am not there is no waiting room in the restaurant so be prepared to huddle in a corner until its your if you cant get a bar seat id continue trying and pass on the dining room as its very far away from the action and nakazawasan only prepares the sushi for the bar diners however if you must try to get table which is right next to the bar usually reserved for vipsservice was great they paid extra attention to me since i was the girl on crutches crutchlife also nakazawasan is as endearing as all the other reviewers made him out to be he dipped quickly after our omakase not but before making himself a hand roll to snack on approx msrp
holy smokes this place isnt a typical restaurant and theres nothing fancy about it but dont let that fool youthis place is the bees knees not only is it the best food ive had in monthsive never had persian food before and i had no idea what i was missing they only had options the day that i visited so i sampled you must get samples of all three i ended up going with the one that is the crowd pleaser did i mention its like the cheapest meal you can get in nyc oh and healthy some vegetables are used in these dishesmake sure to get the garlic crunchies and yogurt on top if the cashier recommends it with the dish you wont be disappointed
an amazing meal great cocktails incredible wine list attentive professional service wonderful food mussels escabeche were succulent delicate quail superb but the black rice with squid simply amazing i wanted another portion to take home we followed these appetizers with the cod which was flavorful and beautifully prepared along with the flank steak which was out of this worth ive never had a more tender or tastier piece of meat well worth the visit and totally deserving of the attention its getting
i have to give this place five stars heres whyproseverything on the menu is hecka cheap from the bagels to burgers you can get lots of items even if you had bucks on youhe actual place looks like your in a manhattan deli or cafe very well lit and a clean place to sit in with friends just if you didnt want to go homethey do deliver to your door and they dont expect tips they do it with a smile on their facesno cons here all smiles and thumb up for this cheapas in good place
of all the latest plays ive seen bedbugs surprisingly has been my favorite and on top of that its a musical if you love campy mutant musicals this is the best of its genre i have never seen a showmusical where the show was bigger than the venue the show is so good it makes the entire place seem bigger than it really is its hard to explain this feeling unless you see it it was amazing it feels like the theatre was too small to contain the energetic flashy and big musical but at the same time i am so happy that its at a small theatre because the show was so up close that it made it even more amazing i couldnt believe it is an offbroadway show there were really no bad seats in the arclight theatre because the theatre is tiny we sat in the second row so it felt like everything was happening right in front of us awesome i knew nothing of this play when we decided to go see it because of the at promotion so glad i convinced my bf to go see the play with me he would have never believed how good the musical is if he didnt go and see it for himself the evil lord cimex completely reminded me of dr franknfurter from the rocky horror picture show i loved every character the actress who played the mad scientist carly is an amazing singer and actress and i totally loved dionne salon played by brian charles rooney i laughed through the entire show it was the most entertaining and fun time ive had at a musical because of the writeup from ny times critics pick the show has been super popular bedbugs continues through oct at the arclight theatre i suggest you run to see this show before it is gone you gotta see it
this is a great date spot beautiful ambiance attentive and friendly staff ahem good looking too came here on a wednesday night for late dinner and drinks at the place still had a few tables and the vibe was really chill cozy and welcoming good deep house playing also helps i arrive early and didnt want to wait outside as it was blustering cold i walked in and was greeted by a very handsome staff he was friendly and sat me right up close to the bar i order a cuvee bubbly to get the warmth going i sit at the bar for about minutes waiting for the lust of my life and while i waited i got to chat up the staff everyone that works here is european no americans the handsome italian with insanely sick dimples was very kind to also charge my phone now that is good service and extremely mesmerizing eye candy my date arrives and we are moved to a table that faces the front of the restaurant we order up a few draft beers and decided on the mezze platter which includes hummus stuffed grape leaves spicy feta dip roasted eggplant and artichoke dip this was a nice serving size for and it came with plenty of pita bread we also ordered the shrimp mezze everything was excellent albeit a bit pricy but remember you are in nolita youre paying their rent also and feeding those models i was told that on the weekends it gets pretty lively and they kick up the deep house music a bit i will definitely be back to ogle the hot staff shake my booty a bit nosh on some yummy tapas and flirt to my hearts content
my new warby parker glasses and i are still casually dating but i think were going to get a little more serious because im starting to really like them ive been wearing contacts daily for more than ten years and only ordinary ie sadlooking glasses for those times right before bed and such when those ordinary glasses broke recently i knew that it was time to get a pair i could actually wear during the day without embarrassing myselfthis location is on the smaller side but there are also fewer customers frames both prescription and sunglasses are placed on backlit shelves and customers are free to try on as many pairs as theyd like i the staff when i was first browsing they completely left me alone but when i grew a bit overwhelmed with the selection i guess my body language made it obvious one staff member swiftly came over and eased my anxiety and suggested frames that went well with my face even though i took forever in making a decision and asked at least three different staff members to pick from my top two everyone made the experience seamless and enjoyable how easy it was to purchase frames all prescription frames are total with an option to get highindex lenses for higher prescriptions at only more they accept eyeglass prescriptions that are up to a year old but they can also call your eye doctor or schedule you for an eye exam there for their home tryon system i went to the store because i live relatively close by and because i wanted to try on as many frames in as many colors as possible but most people opt to do the home tryon it gives people an opportunity to get up to frames to try on for days with free shipping both ways the only sad thing is that some frames arent part of the home tryon for some the warby parker blog it seems the warby parker team is very interested in all things literary the most obvious clue comes from the library setup of all of their manhattan stores and the less obvious clue comes from their blog they update their blog with infographics of things to read and see and theyre oftentimes very funny i also learned that the stores name is derived from two kerouac characters warby pepper and zagg parker zagg pepper would also have been a cool store name their buy a pair give a pair philosophy they make a monthly donation based on the number of glasses sold and those funds go to training glasses and eye exams in developing countries their monocle warbyparkercommonoclelikelihood of another visitwhen these glasses break
tldrthis place tops everything i have reviewed starstldr you dont read anything in my review go to benton on a friday early like before pm and get their friday special chirashi then come back and read this review you will know why i freaking rave about this placeif i could give stars benton gets it no chez panisse and ippudo are nowhere close to getting starswhat makes benton so magical is that they make the most incredible benton boxes that i have ever tasted no experienced in the united states i spent some time studying abroad in tokyo when i was in college and i used to drop by this bento shop after my language school classes were over at around pm they were still selling the leftover bento boxes from lunch at a discount and if im lucky i could score a bento for just yen or so and have it as a yummy dinner benton is the reincarnation of that neighborhood bento shop in new york citybentons bento boxes are really tasty i repeat really tasty you are probably used to shelling out for the soba totto or the sakagura lunch specials to be honest i stopped going to soba totto or sakagura for lunch altogether after i discovered benton their lunch specials are just as good for half the price its so amazing i have no idea how they do itevery single one of bentons bento boxes is a carefully curated symphony of flavors its crazy how many contrasting tastes they can pack into one bento box were talking a main course rice plus side dishes the side dishes are truly the stars of the bento for example you might see a clump of spinach next to your katsu for lunch but rest assured that spinach will certainly not be the plain boiled spinach you eat at home one day it will be lightly tossed with vinegar the next you might find a small dallop of sesame dressing at the bottom some of the small dishes are simply delightful they often make these cute little vegetable skewers were talking inches long and then they deep fry the whole thing and pack it into a bento for your dining pleasure who does that what do you eat for lunch a box of randomly chopped vegetables that cost you at chopt a greasy hamburger smashed together over a smoky grill with onions and tomatoes carelessly thrown on topi really admire the dedication and the time that is simply so evident in bentons bento boxes yes they may make food to go but i would honestly pay double the price for sit down portions of their bentos in a restaurant woorijip in ktown used to a goto place for packed boxed meals but i was just at woorijip last night and it almost makes me angry that woorijip is such a large establishment and open at all hours while benton is a small corner storefront in midtown thats functionally only open for lunch im angry that woorijips food is so inferior compared to benton and im angry that benton does not get more recognitionanyways just go and prepare for your mind to be blown and it will be if you know what good japanese food taste like if you gobenton has amazing usually some form of sushi donburi lunch specials on the weekdays if you want to partake please go early they are usually almost out by pm and certainly out any time after that the bento boxes luckily are not part of the special but they usually run out by pm toonot only does benton have amazing sushibentos their cold noodlerice bowls offerings are great too i had the opportunity to try their bibimnoodle like a bibimbap but with noodles get it p and their hiyashi chuka cold noodles with sesame sauce and both are fantastic i also like their sauce katsu rice bowlthey also make hot food soba udon and ramen ive actually never seen anybody order it because it probably takes some time but you could try it if you wantfree miso soup with purchase of bento make sure you ask for it sometimes the cashier doesnt give it to you unless you ask for itthey have a rewards program but its unfortunately one of the most lowyield reward programs to the order of something like buy bentos get free but still better than nothingtheyre open on saturday but the selection is very small and looks almost like recycled friday food even though im sure it isnt i would recommend to pass on saturdaythey also have bread and onigiri if you dont want a bowl or a boxed lunch every meal is around seriouslythis is so much text i cant handle it just go sparknotes now go on thursfri lunch and get their chirashis friday is better try any of their bento boxes repeat rinse fall in love try all of themi had two weeks when i was just studying for my board exams i had benton every single day for lunch i was so happy i was in love
if by chance you started a foolish quest to try each of the top beers on beer advocate within a calendar year the jeffrey would be a frequent source of aid you might encounter bottles from the bruery maine beer co and even on rarer occasion the rarest belgians and assuming youre sane enough not to attempt an endeavor so frustrating the bar remains more than worth the trip the rotating drafts run the gamut from the accessible at the moment captain lawrences liquid gold to the arcane at the moment anderson valleys the kimmie the yink and the holy gose and change frequently enough to warrant stopping by more often than your wallet will appreciate however what propels the jeffrey to perfection are the generous extensive and thoughtfully curated growler program not to mention the loyalty program therein buy growlers of beer the tenth is free after the get a personalized growler and off for life and the fantastic lunch and happy hour specials lunch is a mere for a happy hour brew and a sandwich or salad and none of the food options are afterthoughts the sandwiches are preposterously good not in comparison to typical bar fare but in comparison to standalone sandwich shops happy hour is impressive in both the breadth of hours and the depth of beer selections available people may lament the fact that the jeffrey is all the way up on and whiners but truthfully the area was in need of a place so objectively great being far from the useless hipster masses is just a bonus
top five dining experiencebest steak i ever had wonderful service cool yet unpretentious atmospherereservations are not easily had lets just say they arent on opentable and you just cant call up if you get the number entering through a door next to a graffiti covered storefront you have no idea that a japanese steak place would be at the end of that long hallway well yes you do this is new york and we all know about going through phone booths to get into bars and standing on our heads and spinning three times in front of the statue of columbus to get into thomas kellers secret speakeasy underneath the time warner centeroh you didnt know about that one you should go try it out let me get my cameraso getting back to bohemian it is small seven tables and a bar for four as others have pointed out on here it is like being in someones living room the chairs were fine for me people have mentioned some awkwardness in trying to eat because the chairs were too low or something but i was fine the service was really great all smiles all the time very gracious made us feel welcome the food me and my wife each got the short rib sashimi the foie gras sushi we split the smoked bacon and split a oz waygu strip loin the first three dishes were all great and i loved everything but the steak was not of this earth it literally melted in my mouth when you get a porterhouse or a ribeye sure there is a ton of flavor but you get a lot of fat and crap you cant eat every part of this steak was eaten there was nothing left over and i would say that one a scale of to the flavor would be a ive had some steaks that were but again they would be very fatty or a little chewy so to have a touch less of that beefy flavor and have a in texture that is my idea of a perfect steak yours might be different but i guarantee you will love the steak here and at for oz for a high grade piece not bad

im so glad a place like this opened up in my neighborhood affordable and convenient lets face it midtown east murray hill isnt that much of a culinary destination nonetheless i can get my fix of crunchy baguette bread filled with well seasoned meats i had the pork belly and it was perfectly tender i really liked the contrast with the crunchy vegetables toopoints also for the hoison sauce siracha and the red chili sauce on every tablemy sandwich came to about for a very generous size both in terms of bread length and toppings keep in mind its cash only but theres an atm inside the store next time im hungry in the hood or surfing on seamless im going to order from this place
its not too noticeable at first but this is absolutely the place for ramen on a cold night it is not expensive at all for a bowl of ramen is standard and absolutely filling the staff is also so nice and tries the best to meet everyones needs we had the miso ramen which was decorated beautifully and made so quickly also be sure to ask for complimentary green tea goes down so well with ramenjust note this place is fairly small but it includes a bar set up in the front for single seaters so its great if youre coming alone so its not the best place for groups but they will always try to accommodate they are also fairly new so when we arrived they had run out of menus but it wasnt much of an issue because they still had left for people i really like it here and i would totally come again

one of my favorite spots in all of manhattan the food is creative delicious and very hearty comfort food at its finest my favorite is the chicken and waffle they have a beautifully fried chicken on top of a purple taro waffle the best thing since spaghetti and meatballs is the beautiful carmelized coconut sauce that goes with it its so delicious and goes perfectly with the savory chicken and the starchy waffle i love their blend of flavors and it satisfied the dessert sweet tooth even as youre eating your meal i want to drink that saucetheir tapsilog is another of my favorites the marinated steak the flavorful garlic rice and the eggi just love to douse it all in the banana ketchup and shovel every bite into my mouth in happinessthe staff is always excellent and well versed in their menu and the restaurant is hopping with a killer soundtrack always playing in the background be aware that its ok to sing along to their hits i also want to note that the restaurant is small and that seating is difficult make reservations and make sure your party is completely intact and on time they are strict about this and its for good reason they have a lot of customers and brunch is very popular and packed i have yet to try their sister restaurant jeepney but i am looking forward to doing that soon stay tuned
toho shoji is a japanese beadcrafts store so glad i found it i used to buy toho beads in japan when i was into making things when i was younger i got back into beading recently and found this store through yelp so glad i went everything is high quality although more expensive than other bead stores in the area but you can see the difference and the people that work there are all japanese and very helpful this one woman helped me find what i was looking for and i was in there looking at everything for a while everything in the store is very organized and clean unlike the nearby chinese stores that are all dusty my hands felt very dirty after going there and the lighting in the store is as it should be overall i would definitely come back here to buy beads once i finish my current projectsupdate ive been into toho and other bead stores in the surrounding area and have found that toho sells the cheapest chains with the highest quality for example i bought a chain for a long necklace that was whereas across the street at bead center they sold a similar chain with cheaper quality for i also bought a chain with an infinity link online it didnt seem to feel like real metal felt light and almost plastic like when compared for a couple of cents cheaper than the infinity link chain i bought at toho it was shinier had a good weight and looked more expensive for about toho will definitely be my goto spot for buying all sorts of chains they have a wider variety are all superior in quality and have a really good price
one of the top meals ive ever had and it wasnt even my birthday came here for my roommates birthday and some friends for the third installment of our ron swanson series i set up everything through open table and we got seated upstairs near the window which had a really nice view the overall atmosphere is very lively and we were glad that we were placed at a table that was a little less loud my friends thought i had planned the table placement but ill never tell anyways we started off with some drinks and our server was very chatty and great with recommendations i went with a lagavulin neat just like ron swanson would delicious and smokey and just the right start to our mealmy friends and i each ordered our own steaks and i ordered the sides for the table we got the mushrooms potatoes au gratin creamed spinach cauliflower and skillet potatoes it was crazy because a flock of waitresses came out with the sides and distributed them to our plates for us my favorite sides were the cauliflower and the spinach cauliflower was roasted perfectly and the spinach wasnt too mushy and actually had some texture with all of that cream all the sides were great except i probably wouldnt order the skillet potatoes again because it was like ordering homemade potato chips which were good but not good that being said out of all of the steakhouses ive been to in new york the sides at del friscos as a whole are probably the best ive ever had i ordered the prime porterhouse which was prepared at just the right temperature and wellseasoned i tried my friends ribeye as well which was delicious but a bit on the fatty side but yeah the steak was great as expected and everyone was too happy to talk for awhile our waiter kept checking in on us and told us stories about nfl draft prospects coming in that day the day before the nfl draft and being too scared to order nice things those kids theyll learn soon enoughthe waiter caught wind that it was my roommates birthday and surprised us with a complimentary wedge of lemon cake which was enormous and delicious the cake itself was moist and the frosting had a bit of tang and wasnt too overwhelming we had to loosen a few belt buckles but we didnt feel disgusting afterwards which was great overall an impeccable experience at del friscos ill definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great steak experience in the city

i stumbled upon this place while wandering around on greenwich avenue in the west villagesaikai formerly shuka dining bar is an izakaya japanese restaurant that serves small plates of tapas grilled dishes salads and ricenoodle creations the menu reflects the classic and contemporary japanese cuisinethe mizuna shirasu salad was very delicious it had mizuna greens shirasu dried baby anchovy dried baby shrimp cream cheese and nikiri soy the salty and sweet flavors blend beautifully with the natural flavor of mizuna i was told by the manager that it was one of the chefs best dishesi chose the yakitori tasting from the menu which was the chefs selection of assorted organic chicken skewers each skewer came with a different flavor that suited my sake tip take it easy on sake it can rack up the billi capped the night with complimentary sorbet although they are still revising their menu soft opening i can tell that this place is very promising and i look forward in coming back pretty soon
if you want a guaranteed great night out this is a place that consistently delivers employees only certainly has a lot going for it nice looking bartenders who serve up a fantastic selection of drinks and craft cocktails good food a warm atmosphere and a stellar playlist of throwbacks ive found this place also draws in a lively bunch of friendly folks which is a huge plus in my opinion weve never been here and not met some cool friendly people to chat with as an added treat for those of you needing a little cosmic guidance the palm reader is usually there at the ready to answer all your questions about lifes mysteries or perhaps let you know if that cutie you just met near the bar is actually your soul mate seriously though this is definitely a place to check out at least once and for those of you who are first timers here are a couple if youre a lightweight like myself be sure to pace yourself between drinks and ask for water because those drinks are strong and they sneak up on you quickly i have learned this one the hard way on more than one occasion be nice to your bartenders they like to have fun here and seem to appreciate customers who like to have fun also if the line for the bathroom is is too long there is a secret bathroom downstairs off of the kitchenthat about wraps it up youre welcome

ate here on comedians in cars with amy schumer what i like about this superb dining establishment is they have an extensive menu fried shrimp with tartar sauce chicken souvlaki grilled mozzarella tuna fish bread and butter corn niblets we ate none of this drinks forget it they have everything sanka snapple egg creams hot chocolate we drank none of these all we had was coffee why because thats the title of the show what i like about the shortstop restaurant in the bronx is that you cannot get a haircut here that keeps the traffic down why because no sane restaurant would give haircuts i have never seen one its not comedians in cars getting haircuts stars we loved it

this place could also be called quantity italianthis amazing restaurant has both quality and quantity a feat that is rarely achieved to such extremesas a man that loves his quantity almost as much as his quality or vice versa maybe i read about the biggest chicken parm in the world here on thrillist and knew i had to come try it immediately and i did and it was glorious from the bread to start to the also overthetop desserts at the endthe bread they bring you to start is some of the best complimentary bread ive ever had it is four little segments of steaming hot garlic knots they bring you olive oil and salt as well which are unnecessary since they are so deliciously oily and salty already if i didnt have pounds of chicken to eat coming shortly i would have definitely asked for more of thiswe still of course needed a starter before all the chicken so we got the sausage pepper garlic toast this was a great starter it was pretty oily but it was really delicious it was like an upscale version of a sausage peppers heroand then the main event the chicken parmigiana per person this thing is insane it is as delicious as it is ridiculous and overthetop i feared some quality would be lost with the novelty but i was luckily wrong this was some amazingly good chicken parm the beautifully huge portion which is served like a pizza pie from the way it looks down to the way they cut it up into slices with a pizza cutter was shockingly neat and wellmadeto get through all that chicken they also give you a small arugula salad which was very refreshing not so refreshing but incredibly delicious were the other sides we ordered we got the rigatoni meatballs because you clearly need to have some pasta when you are having chicken parm and the corn creme brulee i was thinking we should opt for a vegetable to stave off a heart attack but our great waiter suggested this as a specialty of theirs using joey tactics corn gooood creme brulee goooood so we had no choice but to try it and we were not disappointed this was a crazy dish it really was like a creme brulee with the crisp shell on top and a sweet soft interior only it was made of corn it was deliciousafter suffering through my half of the parm pie i cant believe i ate of those huge slices we were food drunk and our judgement was obviously impaired because we ordered two dessertsi was shocked again at the value and quality of these desserts we got the coffee bun crumble gelato which was incredible they give you a massive amount of gelato for such a nice place as this and it was really delicious the cinnamon crumble and candied walnuts complemented the coffee gelato perfectlyand lastly the zeppole workshop another great excessive treat they bring you a massive spread consisting of ten piping hot zeppole ricotta balls along with all the accoutrements honey melted chocolate powdered sugar and ricotta gelato a great fun treat to end an overly satisfying mealalong with the amazing food everything else about this place is perfect too its a really nice upscale atmosphere offset by some good seemingly out of place hiphop music most of all though the service was perfect our waiter as well as all of the busboys were super polite and friendly and my glass of water was constantly full key to combat all that deliciously salty parmi love this place i want to come back but maybe with more than one other person next time to try to conquer that delicious parm and some more great entrees
hot damn i always knew the frick was considered a sortofhidden gem but i didnt expect to like it as much as i did its a small museumif you take your time at each painting you can still walk it all in hours its big enough to wow youi kept seeing paintings i recognized and thinking i didnt know we had this in nyc toobut small enough not to overwhelm you its collection of art spans centuries and is eclectic i dont think its heavily frequented by tourists and it doesnt allow children so its pretty peaceful i was there on a weekday though so that mayve contributed to its relative emptinessscattered thoughts you wont feel guilty for not reading all the details on the placards by the works because there are no placards most of the works have no notes other than the name and the artist if you do want more detail the audio guides are free i didnt listen to them but ive heard from others theyre detailed and very good an introductory movie plays every half hourits only minutes long and is worthwhile it gives you a brief overview of herny clay frick and how the museum came about if youre pressed for time the video plays on the website as well highlights include all of the turners you can recognize them from across a room theyre so distinctivebright colors huge landscapes impressing nature upon you impressionistic swathes before impressionism was a thing mixed in with extraordinarily fine architectural details the fragonard room these paintings all ought to be kitschy with their unreal lushness and macaron colors but they overwhelm you with their skill and exuberance also they are amusingly pervertedjust look at the one with the bosomy blond dreamily eyeing the sky while her hands down between her notverysubtly spread legs shes fully clothed in an elaborate dress but it doesnt change whats happening you look at this painting and imagine fragonard had a very good time in his studio rembrandts the polish rider may not be a rembrandt its status is contested
let me start out by stating that the prefixe menu with three dishes plus desserts is totally worth it i chosesea urchin black bread jalapeno and yuzu generous portion of sea urchin served on top of lightly toasted black bread they went together very well i first thought a hint of yuzu on top of sea urchin was a bit weird but the combination definitely grew on me turbot with chateau chalon sauce this was the first time ive tried turbot and i thoroughly enjoyed it the fish was only lightly seasoned but the texture was so soft that i didnt even have to use a knife to cut it the highlight of the dish was of course the chateau chalon sauce i dont even know what it is made out of but it was so good that i was practically licking the plate in the end it went very well with the lightly seasoned fish and made the dish very flavorful yet not overwhelming overallduck breast topped with cracked jordan almonds perfectly grilled to mediumrare the meat went very well with the almond crust on top as well as the sauce on the side it was possibly one of the best duck dish ive ever had in the city the portion was quite generous so i felt very full in the end for desserts you get to pick one from chocolate strawberry fig and summer special i went with strawberry since i was craving something light after my heavy duck dish the sorbet and sponge cake were excellent but i kind of wish i had picked the chocolate one my friends seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their warm chocolate lava cake and white chocolate ice cream the prefixe is complemented with several smallbite dishes broccoli soup three different kinds of sorbet etc here and there and i was satisfied with every one of them even the complimentary bread served in the beginning was greatin sum this was one of the best fancy dining experiences ive had i was a bit taken back by the fact that the noise level was higher than i expected certainly not loud but not quiet and serene either but i think in retrospect that it made the overall experience less overwhelming and more enjoyable in the end needless to say the service and ambiance were amazing through and through i highly recommend this place for any special occasion given the quality and portion of food the prefixe is definitely worth every single penny
this restaurant just opened over the weekend it has the vibe of a seafood shack the staff is friendly and helpful about the food options i tired the soft shell sandwich it was great i had never tried a sandwich like this and i must say i was very pleasantly surprised the items are served inside of dough that taste like it was just baked i also tried the sweet plantains i will defiantly get a side of these the next time i come in if you are looking for something unique and authentic you should definitely try this place out
as i rarely find myself in the fidi area i was really happy when my lovely ladies shing yiing o and stephanie q asked me to join them at the dead rabbit for an after work cocktailthe menu is so cool you literally have to leaf through an awesome little pictured book to decide what your choice of drink is of the night you even get a little history of the place if you care to read the other things that arent drinks i love that its like a graphic novel that you leaf through to order your drinks they have so many choices that its so hard to pick only one or two or well you get the ideathe best part other than drinking was that my drink came out in a tea pot i pretty much thought that was just about the coolest thing ever the food here was okay but really aim here to come for drinks because there are a lot more choices for beverages than food obviously we waited downstairs in the main bar area until a table was ready upstairs for us its a really great setting here and a very cool place to check out
did you sell your kidney because if you did we should spend all of your earnings at sushi azabu dont worry ill sell mine next and well be even i prrrooommise i was here several years ago and came back once again last week food quality has not changed one bit dreams are made from this stuff omakase was ordered both times we upgraded to include the uni flight this second time around it is a plate with a huge serving of uni on the left from santa barbara and a huge serving of uni on the right from hokkaido and a shot glass display of seaweed slices in the middle for you to wrap your precious uni jewels in oh dear lord this may sound like blasphemy but i believe that was heaven there are several signs of a great sushi place i always look for i dont bother looking at your average neighborhood quality of rice how well the rice was seasoned in house soy sauce check ugh get that kikoman away from me hes the soysauce boogie man lurking in every neighborhood sushi spot planning to poison my unwitting dishes with sodium get away the sushi chef was excellent the meal was amazing one bummer is sushi abazu changed their omakase policy they used to keep feeding you sushi and sashimi until you asked the chef to stop now they have a set course but a set course defeats the purpose of omakase omakase really means ill leave it up to you not we have a preplanned xnumbered course sushi sashimi meal readyeither way the quality was still amazing good luck getting a table youll need it oh and youll also be needing that organ sales money for this joint
if im honest i come here at least once a week despite my diet one of the best things about this city is the abundance of dollar pizza spots and this one far exceeds others ive been to its rare that youll get a slice thats cold or isnt fresh because they only keep two pies out at a time the slices are very reasonably sized and really really tasty in fact their pizza is better than the dollar slices ive had at some other pizza places and obviously the value cant be beat its a tiny shop so theres no seating or standing room inside but most people just stand outside to eat their slice theres often a line outside the door but it moves really quickly if youre in the area looking for cheap eats this place is definitely worth checking out

eating at ippudo westside or east village is a guaranteed wait but the wait at this location is much more reasonable than that at its sister location my coworker d and i strolled over from our office and arrived just before pm to find ourselves with a minute wait time unheard of in a good way so naturally we decide to order a bottle of sake to nurse while i scoped out the restaurant the space is definitely smaller than i expected but i loved the view and layout of the communal table in the first dining area the second adjoining room of the restaurant has the more standard seating arrangement ie tables and booths accommodating all in all the interior was sleek tasteful and betterlit than the sister restaurant in east villageonce we got seated our friendly server runs us through the menu and the days specials collectively the three of us including the waitress on this one decide to order lobster hasami special of the day lobster claw with maitake mushroom celery puree yuzu pepper meringue and ikasumi sauce squid ink miso reduction d and i couldnt stop raving about this dish that puree and meringue was interesting and amazing tako wasabi i dont know how i never got around to trying this as d tells me its on the ev menu as well it had just the right amount of wasabi to pair with and accent the fresh octopus pork hirata buns they were as succulent and tender as i remember hooray for consistency but as i was telling d the buns are now considered a given in the ippudo dining experience a staple that i wont ever stop ordering but it lacks the excitement a good new dish provides miyazaki wagyu steak ohemgee im salivating as i write this this was the best dish of the night hands down for both d and i the slivers of steak were cooked to a perfect mediumrare accompanied by a trio of dipping options salt wasabi soy and something more ponzuesque so tender so juicy so delicious the price is a bit steep for an appetizer and the portion too small to be an entree but worth every goddamn cent our waitress gave us the on this beef and apparently per se uses the same sourcedistributor and prices it at the price get it get it get it i cant say it enough karaka men with nitamago the spicy ramen in pork broth had so much flavor with a good spicy kick the texture of the noodles are to die for as always and perfect for soaking up the brothneedless to say a very satisfying meal d says he was pleasantly pleased to find ippudo westside as good as ippudo ev and that he i will be going back as often as we can time to work work work so we can afford more dinners for two yikessss the sake we ordered was the azumaichi so good we ordered a second bottle to accompany dinner totally recommend it
how do i love thee let me count the location location location propped next to harlem public its a hard choice to choose between these two places even though i know their homies with each other i see the love fests on twitter haaa still how nice is it to have some awesome new bars popping up in west harlem thus saving us kids that live in upstate manhattan constant trips downtown very nice the drink selection is excellent not overwhelming and inexpensive two cans of hard cider a shot of whiskey and a few fingers of glenlivit only put my tab up to those aint downtown prices quite happily an amazing jukebox is filled with interesting varied yet oddly complimentary choices im talking pharcyde common mos def bloc party aqueminiera outkast fleetwood mac the kinks pauls boutique and so on i found a dollar on the floor and id like to thank whomever dropped it i picked ms fat booty and bombs over baghdad and those choices were met with universal approval from fellow patrons as for the latter two girls next to me started screaming and dancing when andre started spitting his first few verses that made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside aside from the ounces of hard cider inside of the space and interior design are amazing they worked with the space quite interestingly the bar has a gorgeous curve that juts into the main area and there is additional smaller table near the rear the entrance also boasts whats best described as bleacher seating just two rows of seats to just post up and chill on the rear holds a game area with table hockey and the biggest freaking game of jenga youve ever seen surely it took a little getting used to the sound of the blocks falling but soon the beau and his friend and i were watching from the bar cheering everyone playing on the bathrooms have the best feature of any bathroom ive ever seen in a bar and im not talking about the dry erase walls and markers they encourage patrons to use im talking about locks that indicate if a bathroom is vacant or occupied in bars that are noisy it can be annoying to knock on a door to see if someone is in it and its simply awkward to be unsure if you heard anyone and pull on the handle thank you at the wallace for being so damn smart and putting those locks in now its just up to patrons to actually lock them when theyre in there ha as for the dry erase markers i had to separate the fact that ive worked in infection control for years and could only imagine the germs on those markers hey its all about building up immunity right ha so i allowed myself a little bit of fun with the markers but definitely washed my hands for seconds afterwardsmy only gripe one that can be easily fixed the bar was almost constantly wet bartenders whipping out drinks were spilling and not wiping that can be easily fixed with a towel however it just sucked that i ended up with wet elbows and a wet phone on occasion heh but if you cant handle getting a little wet at a bar once in a whilehahahathe older and wiser i get about establishments in and around this fine city the more hesitant i am to give out five star reviews on yelp at the wallace readily earned all five of them this bar is now my happy place

a couple of friends were in town so we decided to get together at morimoto for a party of our reservation was secured for after checking in we were informed by the host that we had to wait a little because the table before us was lingering fine nbd wouldnt be a chelsea restaurant without a wait during that wait time we talked about the decor looked over the morimoto cookbook that was on display took photos until we realized that minutes had passed we were getting a little impatient and the host was kind enough to treat us for drinks for our wait could we really be bought by alcohol the answer is absolutely the boys got beers while a few of us got this delicious bulleit bourbon cherry drink that was sososososooso delicious bourbons the best next to scotch finally an hour later and after the host profusely apologized we were sat was this wait ridiculous yes but i noted to my friend that i could not fault the restaurant too much for it because they were so kind to us even treated us to some appetizers that were brought nearly immediately after we sat because we loved since were absolutely starving and thoughtful the appetizer thing i couldnt think of anything more comforting than being able to eat something immediately after sitting down we were gracious because probably we would have been really upset had they not gone to all the trouble to make us feel better as far as food goes i ordered the surf and turf that composed of a wagyu skirt steak and hamachi ribbons herbed potatoes that were to die for i couldnt believe potatoes could taste this good crushed citrus avocado the hamachi ribbons were prepared tableside which was cute and quick i also split the veggie of the day sunchoke with pesto for with a friend and it was the perfect combination my friend jodi ordered the sushi plate the size and was pleased by all the fresh sushi choices on her plate tran ordered the chirashi sushi which was a huge portion of fresh fish it was probably the least expensive dish yet came in a gigantic bowl and had about things inside she was absolutely stuffed my pal sandra ordered the duck duck duck that contained a duck sandwich duck egg and i forget the third componentall in all the wait sucked but the service was superb and the food mouthwatering ill be back heard the desserts were amazing next time for sure

this bare bones but charming manhattan outpost of dough brings their superb product within walking distance of my desk well i guess bedstuy is too but thats not a reasonable jaunt superfriendly staff during the soft opening and the same superb product with plans for churros and cake doughnuts as they officially launch this location thrilled and alarmed that ill now be able to procure their substantial yet pillowy and powerful yet nuanced donuts directly from the supplier outside bk in the greater union square area no less everything in moderation except donuts and ice cream i always sayi hesitated to post this for fear that it will be even more mobbed over opening week but we all know no one reads my reviews anyway it was empty on opening morning fortunately plus i left out the best partcheesecake is their only nonstunner though it was served up overfried and untimelylyimproperly glazed on grand opening day so it may
two words unlimited sangriado i even need to continue this review we walked into calle ocho a little after on a sunday after reading a few reviews and tips i was afraid we wouldnt get seated for brunch like everybody said its crazy in here dont expect to sit in the dining area unless you made reservations luckily there was comfortable seating available for us in the lounge we had our own personal waiter and he was very attentive he checked in on us every minutes and made sure our glasses never went unfilled i really wanted to remember his name but after my second glass i just knew that wasnt going to happen the sangria here is awesome actually some of the best and strongest ive had i ordered the havana banana punta cana and tropical in that order but i tried the spanish harlem fresas and roja in that order hey its unlimited people dont judgeoh snap i was so sangria happy i almost forgot about the food we ordered the gallitos for two and it definitely hit the spot i strongly suggest this if youre looking for a light but fulfilling meal but people that complimentary bread was a winner i asked our waiter for details he told us how it was made and the country it was from sadly i dont remember anythingim coming back and im coming with a group

so i figured out what that pain was on the side of my torso apparently thats the sensation you get when you whore out your pancreas to macarons so this is what love feels like and diabetes no worries i read somewhere on wedmd you can live without that organpancreas im begging you please stopshut up pancreas bring me more insulin muahahahahahahah anywho much like that anorexic girl from my chemistry class has won my affection this place also holds my heart fun fact she loves macarons because everyone loves macarons duh theres a number of reasons to visit this because i said the only place youll find earl grey macarons in town the they have a cheetos flavored macaron cheetos its one of those combinations you never expect to go together until you try it like nutella on pizza or nutella sex theyre all delicious combinations fun fact the most popular edible lingerie flavor is cherry chocolate being the they hold macaron making classes pretty they make custommade macarons to name a few hello kitty ghostbusters their cat i believe his name was mr socks or captain socks sometimes its too cute you almost feel guilty eating it almost oh also they were listed as one of the top macaron spots in ny they were also acclaimed for their blondies i havent tried one myself because im always too distracted by the macarons
being of originally ukranian descent i thought it would be fun to check out this place only blocks from me from the ukranian flag hanging outside to the waiters waitresses dressed in traditional garb it was a great and funfilled eating experiencethe television has some ukranian old school movies playing and the entire place has different ukranian decour around it unlike the also locale onegin russian fusion this place totally took the ethnic theme and rolled with iti came in with a groupon which was a really good deal and came with cold appetizers warm appetizers entrees and drinks the waiter came by and gave some a recommendationswe started with roasted pork with garlic it was quite tasty be careful with the horseradish sauce though also had the olivier salad which consisted of boiled chicken filet potatoes carrots and eggs and tasted similar to a potatoey coleslaw also hit the spotround was the potato draniki which was essentially potatoe latkas with sour cream it was hannukah for my taste buds t was cooked just right the third round was lean borsch picked over the one with veal i must say for a usual nonfan of borsch this hit the spot it was just the right mix of beetroot onion carrot and sweet peppers with potatoes oh and more sour cream final course was pork shish kebab chicken a la kiev the shish kebab was tasty but a little salty for my tastes the chicken a la kiev i was a bigger fan of as it was crispy and rolled around butter and herbs the side salad was a nice touch tooi almost forgot the drinks how can you go to a ukranian place without vodka the deal came with an infused vodka shot and i chose the lindenberry one it seemed to be almost more than shot and was on the strong side but tasted great and im not one to complain about too much alcoholoverall the service was good and this is the type of place where you dont want them to rush the food out but bring it out gradually course by course on exiting the girl in the front stopped us and offered us free shots with a cucumber a great final touch for a fun evening in kiev oops i mean soho

recommends probably everything budae jeongol spicy sausage casserole pajeon pancakeordered budaechigae pajeon bo ssamspent per person for a table for literally the second floor to third floor if you know what im sayin you are a regular ktown fiend my friend the layout and vibe is even similar to that of third floor why yes i did get confused the first time i went after pm you get the packed drunken crowd but the reason why this is a gem is that sweet spot during dinner when things are quiet the waiters are attentive and the kitchen has time to do what they do bestfirst up the side dishes theres only one big side dish but dont be fooled its a great light mixture of acorn jelly daikon and chives and let me tell you the pickled veggies here are the best if youre a fan of the pickled sour beeninthegroundforcenturies taste you will hate it but if you like the fresh slightly flavored and spicy pickled goods with that crunch this place will be your best friend ask for the picked green peppers too youll become addictedthey make sure the food is hot and all dishes came out on heat stands the pajeon wasnt overly oily was crispy and yes kimchi was fresh lightly grilled to perfection now top that with the pickled green pepperssauce and youve got yourself a winner and you dont have to worry about the food getting coldapparently the owner of this place also owns pocha so of course we got the budae chigae what else would you get and true to its promise comes a big pot with noodles and just fresh everything i think this is why i love this place it tastes so fresh the seafood the veggies heck even the ramen noodles the portion is smaller than pocha and theres no ludicrous amounts of cheese but wait for it they make fried rice out of the leftovers of the soup mindblown wait what you think youre full then comes this fried rice from the amazing soup that you just had and if you love the crispy crunchy rice at the bottom of the rice cooker thats what youre going to get apparently they load it up with cheese so if you dont think youll like that ask for the fried rice without ityou get a side of rice free before pmbut its not just rice its a huge heaping pile of jasmine with an egg and seaweed flakes on top mind blownthe bo ssam was so so though tender and well cooked it lacked flavor and was a bit bland but definitely satisfying without the hefty price of momofukuyou might want to come here for the soju but come on soju or

i am not a fan of vegetarian food but i enjoyed the dosas here the food is cheap and tastes super fresh also everything is pretty authentic which i appreciated everything on the menu looks good i got wither the second or third dosa on the menu and it was delicious next time i would get the jaffna curry we waited in line for almost minutes and normally i would take a star off but they have ginger beer cans that i used to drink in sri lanka so i was a happy camper the cans were and i gladly bought two with all the cash i had if you just want an appetizer you can skip the line and order from the side
mollys why are you so far away from the ueshow about you open up another branch nearby so that we dont have to make that long trek to the west villagethis dessert spot is super cute with their swings at the bar they have multiple tables in order for you to enjoy your time their especially if you are in the mood for board gamesif you know me you know i am not the biggest sweets type of gal especially those heavy frosting cupcakes where i can barely finish half but mollys has changed my mind with their light and fluffy cupcakes if i were to eat sweets i would be more towards the fruity side and mollys has that wide selection for memy favorites are the creme brulee and the peach cobbler not too heavy but just perfect with the flavors on my tongue i have tried other ones such as the mango and cookie dough which were also both delicious but doesnt compare to my favsdefinite recommendation

there is a reason why this studio is so famous they offer high quality classes so it will not disappoint but be forewarned you have to have some knowledge of yoga before coming here i came here for a open class the receptionist checked me in quickly gave me a tour around and explained everything to me they have a cafe in the studio so that is cool they also sell tons of merch if thats your thing the locker room is basically only for changing and they have one shower stall the bathrooms are separate good idea alleviates congestion no lockers really so take your things into the class make sure you also take all your clothes with you too thats what the receptionist recommended which means clothes have disappeared yikes that would suck to come back and your clothes were gone water fountain right outside the changing room the yoga practise room is big can probably fit or more yogis my class wasnt that packed so we could all spread out our instructor was amazing she started off with some singing and harmonium playing and then read an excerpt from her lessons and the theme was what is your identity got me thinking about that cool the practise was challenging and i really enjoyed the challenge it was very humid the night i went and so i was sweating profusely the instructor noticed and came over and rubbed menthol into my neck and back that really helped to cool me down she also stretched me out nicely in reverse warrior she wedged my knee into her legs and kept me stable and kept my knee from bending inward that helped a lot i appreciate when an instructor can see your limits and just push you that much further i reached another level with this instructor this class is definitely about proper alignment and the further i get into yoga the more i am aware of how important alignment is if you dont align correctly you can get injured the class ended after minutes and i have to say the final oms we chanted were some of the most beautiful our instructor has a beautiful voice i will def be back regardless if i have a pass or not just be prepared to work and to reap the rewards later
hidden and tucked in a basement level floor bangia is a very typical korean joint though youre in for a great night here expect full authenticity when it comes to their service food and drink there could be the potential for some language barriers so it certainly helps to have a guest who speaks the native tongue but not required their pricing is right they have plenty of tvs for sports loving folks theres a full bar many tablesseats to go around great food menu they have the right setup and atmosphere for larger parties for a night of fullblown eating and drinking bangia is definitely the spot to check out bangia is all about drinking and eating more eating and more drinking and repeat order bottles of soju and two or more of their appetizing dishes ideally meant to be shared with another or amongst a group their dishes come large in portion we came as a group of three split four bottles of soju along with two large platters the marinated pork feet and the seafood dukbokki spicy rice cake with seafood resting in spicy sauce and tons of mozzarella this is clearly korean comfort food at its best the pork feet was delicious though the ultimate clear winner was the seafood dukbokki simply amazing no doubt their dukbokki is a musttry the preparation is wonderful portion is more than generous and its just an incredibly satisfying comfort food dish this was perhaps the best dukbokki ive experienced in ktown its loaded with seafood mozzarella and rice cake the ingredients were all in balance i have no complaints regarding the food some negatives however the service can be a bit slow servers do come around quite often so you can wave them over should you need something because their dishes are on the larger side expect at least minute wait or more on preparation otherwise no outstanding issues to note bangia is simply the perfect casual nofrills ktown spot for binge eating and drinking ill be sure to return again for many many bottles of soju and their mindblowing seafood dukbokki

you know what i might like the most about the name maybe every bar and restaurant should take a page from the playbook and just name itself after its location then maybe one day i could have the pleasure of texting one of my degenerate friends the name of a bar or restaurant to meet at without getting the response ok where is it every freaking time like they arent already holding a device that would have answered that question in less time than it took them to text me that ah yes let me google that for youyou lazy piece of shtspeaking of my very special friends has become our unofficial friday night family dinner gathering spot besides being one of the only dining establishments that my friends can locate on a map its also byob so like holy crap god is that you and now i must interrupt with a public service message in case you havent noticed byob restaurants in manhattan are becoming an endangered species its like that old saying manhattan without byob is like a yellow porsche without a douchebag behind the wheel it just doesnt make sense i cant keep all of the remaining byob places in business by myself okay everyone needs to step up and be a regular patron at one of manhattans remaining byob establishmentsbefore its too late because if ever falls off the byob wagon or implements an inflated corkage fee which is basically just as bad the guilt wont be on my shoulders ya hearlastly i want to give a shoutout to the badass owner of vinny sgarlato who will probably claim not to know me after reading this review but it wouldnt be the first time thats happened in all seriousness vinnys personal investment in this restaurant is obvious and i think that many restaurant owners managers could learn a lot from him recently my friends i ended up being the last table there shocking and vinny sat down and had a conversation with us we got to talking about yelp reviews actually also he never openly judges us for say bringing bottles of wine per person so cheers to thatoh yeah wait the food i forgot about the food the food is actually awesome too
dinner reviewupstate gets stars rounded way way up my sister and i arrived around saturday evening and was given a hour wait we were also last on the list of names pretty much before the kitchen closed at the hostess man texts when your table is ready but we opted to stick around the area and were outside when our table was ready at about was so so so excitedfamished and overly excited i proceeded to order too much food but not really since we managed to scarf it all downthe oysters i probably could have eaten of these by myself i know nothing about oysters so i told the waiter tell me about each of them ended up with a couple larger east coast oysters and a west coast oyster they were so fresh and so deliciouscrab cakes that spicy honey arugula salad was to die for the crab cakes were meh nothing beats a maryland crab cake and these werent comparable sadly still delicious but not anywhere near comparable to the best crab cakes ive ever had would liked to see bigger crab chunkssteamed clams if i could give more than stars this would get it those clams were way bigger than i was expecting and they were tender and ohsojuicy the beer broth was salty and flavorful and they gave you bread to soak in the yumminess id come back to upstate every week just for thesescallop entree grilled over a bed of squash zucchini and mushrooms sis had this dish and she loved it i had a bite of the scallops grilled to perfection and the veggies which were a nice and simple filler for the mealclam fettuccine sadly my least favorite of the night after seeing many good reviews i guess i was hyped up and ready for some deliciousness i was hoping for something more like the italian clam linguine but it was not i guess im not much of a fan of fettuccine pasta to begin with but the extra super buttery sauce with the breadcrumbs onions and cheese just didnt do it for me the bread stuff kind of reminded me of my favorite stouffers tv dinner dish so maybe thats what ruined it for me the smaller clams were delicious thoughcomplimentary whiskey cake if youre a fan of whiskey this stuff is for you you can definitely taste the whiskey in this reminds of the the jamaican rum cake from my cruise ship daysdespite a couple hiccups in a couple of the dishes i still loved this place and know i will love this place the next time i go back and try some other stuff that is when i feel like waiting for an hour for dinner again
absolutely amazing have passed this place a few times and have seen pictures of their beautifully plated entrees floating around instagram and decided to give his place a shot i came here after enjoying a few tapas somewhere else so i didnt order much and i regret this i wish i couldve stretched my stomach out three times so i could get a taste of everything the black ant had to offerfirst off i love the feel of this place there is outdoor seating for those who want to bask in the summer sun and the vibe out here cannot be more different than the one inside the inside is very dark and trendy the walls are covered in different types of art all centered around ants in the back there is a really funky one with many colors on the side walls there are tiles of golden ants the decor is beautiful without being over the top and i really enjoyed admiring them while waiting for my food to come outi had the cucumber margarita which while nothing special was a good drink very refreshing i also had the huarache de nopal which is grilled cactus pad black mission figs asadero cheese pilonsillo chilhuacle marmalade this sounds a lot fancier than it is but it was very good especially all the asadero cheese on the bottom ive never had such good cactus it was prepared well but if you arent a big fan of vegetarian dishes i could not recommend this one instead i would recommend the una con todo which is a bucket of chorizo pork belly yuca fries and cheese cochoyotes with a side of tabiche salsa the salsa was super flavorful packed an amazing punch to otherwise bland ingredients but wow the chorizo and pork belly were mind blowing so tender my teeth pierced right through it better pork belly than ippudo which is a big compliment the little yuca fries had an amazing texture and were fun to eat i would order this a million times if i didnt want to try every single thing on the menu and there is a lot yet surprisingly the menu isnt overwhelmingi cannot wait to come back here after my wisdom teeth are removed i havent eaten in weeks and i am ready to gorge this place is a mustgo
a new friend told me about this place never even heard of it she tells me its amazing best ice cream in the city hands downok i wanna tryi scoped out another more well know ice cream spot elsewhere and was quite disappointed so i was really hoping for great things from this placewhoafirst of all if a place has lychee flavored sorbet thai iced tea flavored ice cream im already going to give it a chance exotic and unique flavors are a must must be different from the grocery store flavors mind was blown there was no taste testing i dove right inoddfellows you provided my lunch for me that dayi approve
this is only the second location for this popular brooklynbased bake shop that opened a few days ago on street their advertisement mentions that theyre the former staff of the legendary baker cakeman raven when i stopped by over the weekend it was only their second day doing business and they still had a few noticeable touches to make both the inside and outside of the shop nevertheless they seemed to still be pretty well stocked and ready to introduce harlem to their cakes they were even giving out samples right outside i should mention that its a pretty small shop with no inside seating and just a few seats outside for those who prefer to sit and eat rather than take their cake on the road and as far as i can tell they basically just sell cakes cupcakes and ice cream prices are low with slices of cake going for six dollars and three dollars for cupcakes not bad at allive already heard a lot of talk about their brooklyn shop so im looking forward to adding this place to my list of regular neighborhood dropin spots so far ive only had a slice of their signature red velvet cake but i enjoyed it very much and felt that it well exceeded my expectations the cake and frosting were both surprisingly very light and not too sweetperfectly balanced and the slices are really big too id have to say that for me it was probably the best red velvet cake that id tasted anywhere which means that ill be dropping in again soon
zh√†mi or asian fried rice balls is the asian interpretation to what gastrofiends like most of us know as the italian arancini zh√† pan asian has come up with a winning formula to bridge two worlds of flavor i tried their fare at pardon the pun hester street fair while coming here on the second week of the fairs opening their staff is friendly and onpoint with suggesting choices that work with my palate coincidentally one of the owners steve who worked the event that day touched on how they came upon this ideathe rice balls we ordered were fried to perfection crispy on the outside flavorful and moist on the inside without leaving a greasy taste that normally would accompany fried foods i have one word yum embedded in each were thai chicken curry chinese bbq pork korean bbq beef and tofu with curry sauce yes practically bought several of each my favorite had to have been kbbq beef bulgogi not bc of my affinity for korean bbq but that of how the meats were marinatedthe open air venue makes for a very low pressure purchase nibble or nom the choice is yours but im also been made aware that they operate within another storefront during other seasons in the ev east village if you dont find your way to the fair in time look them up youll probably find them established in another store or popup since people have taken notice its been cited by nbc village voice twitter i wont mention celebrity namesmy only regret was having missed their korean fried chicken waffles which sold out earlier that day ugh talk about heartbreak hopefully ill be able to revisit for that next time
my two best girlfriends took me here for my birthday this year we have a thing for french food small dishes and anywhere with good wine this spot is amazing super cozy and our waiter was very attentive odd thing though the decor does not match the whole french vibe all three of us were a little confused although the setting was quite intimate we felt like we were in one of those wants to be trendy thai restaurants think spice besides that food was delicious and they were all small portions so we had many dishes to choose from and try my favorite dishes that we shared were the escargot so good we got chicken liver mousse this was my absolute favorite i couldnt get enough and goes perfectly with the bread in the sack and the oz filet mignon with fries entree dish medium rare and cooked to perfection the other things we ordered were ok but those three were my top choices one awesome thing about this spot is their wine flight happy hour from super generous glasses of wine for there are a few options to choose from but i loved my choice cant remember the name but it had a rose wine among the threei had the best birthday dinner here and cannot wait to come back
boyfriend and i had a very nice time here tonight good food good drinks good service good space we both went for the massive heisenburger which was ounces of meaty pat lafrieda goodness topped with caramelized onions housemade pickles lettuce tomato and your choice of cheddar or swiss i had no idea the name was a breaking bad reference since ive managed to avoid watching a single episode of the show but that did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of what was a hell of a burger thick juicy and perfectly cooked this was the best burger ive had in quite awhileboyfriend also ordered fries which i opted to skip considering the burger behemoth i was about to consume so massive in fact that we were initially asked if we intended it split it in a thoughtful touch the kitchen split the fries evenly between our two basketswednesday through labor day they are hosting owl hour from with teainfused cocktails for just a nickle you can only get one but the full price is still a very reasonable they were using a pink and black owl brew mixer and had three drinks to choose from an excellent slightly spicy lime and cilantro drink was the most inventive but a fruity white wine sante√° was also quite good and went down a little easier the third option was pink and black mixed with bourbon which was surprisingly smooth ill admit i didnt have the highest of hopes for a tea cocktail mixer but im officially a fan overall there was a nice casual vibe bustling but not overly crowded the staff seemed totally friendly and efficient i was also impressed to see the chefowner chris tending bar and taking orders i imagine it might get pretty busy on the weekends but its good to know theres a cool reasonablypriced place in the meatpacking district

i was looking for a mexican brunch spot to host my hubs milestone birthday brunch since his bday falls on the day of the dead ofrenda didnt flinch when i said i had guests for a saturday afternoon brunch we arrived at and all stayed till close to took over their entire outdoor seating since the weather was perfect for dining al fresco we literally ordered everything on their brunch menu times over guacomole was a huge hit as a starter and the inventive drinks kept coming and were delicious the service was spot on the entire time and they were totally fine with me bringing in my own dessert for my groupwell definitely be back to host another event or just for date night
ok so this review may be heavily influenced by the fact that this place serves unlimited white wine for free yeah its cheap boxed wine but im a college student so i have grown accustom to it hahanot only was the free wine awesome but the food we had was awesome as well there was of us and we shared the szechuan dumplings chow fun with shrimp chicken with three different nuts and the mixed chinese vegetables i have been craving their szechuan dumplings since i left they were in a delicious peanut sauce with hot oil we contemplated getting another order they were that addictive i used the leftover sauce to pour over the white rice that came with our entreessuch a good decision the chicken with three different nuts was definitely my next favorite the glazed walnuts were my favorite part and added some sweetness to the dish i didnt have much of the chow fun but the mixed chinese vegetables were a great choice to sort of balance out the other dishesthis place really hit the spot after a long day of apartment hunting i would probably come here all the time if it wasnt all the way in the uws we were in the area to see celebrity autobiography service was nice and friendly and the prices are cheap bill for people was under they refilled our wine supply at the table multiple times without us asking and even when we were paying the checka smart idea to get us feeling more generous
i grew up in the as the child of an executive at howard johnsons the only flavor in my freezer was howard johnsons mint chocolate chip ice creamhowever i did not like howard johnsons mint chocolate chip ice cream i have to wonder how much different life would be if id had access to fernet black walnut ice cream granted i dont know what a fernet is and ill be damned if im going to bother googling it but i would have preferred that to mint chocolate chip any day of the week im sorry mr johnsonmy children unaware how spoilt for choice they are nonchalantly chose passionfruit apricot sorbet and green tea pistachio from the menu of flavors i had been wrongfully denied during my childhood this reminds me i need to regale them with stories of how i grew up with no ipad and only mint chocolate chip they love those storiesafter agonizing over choices like salted pretzel and salt pepper pinenut i opted for salted chocolate there seems to be a salt theme which im fine with as my body is mainly sodium and wine i also recall vietnamese coffee speaking of i still havent forgiven jane fonda

located in an obscure area where chinatown meets lower east side this restaurant is one of those hip eateries that you can only find downtown crowd seemed like a mix of hipsters whites asians europeans and artsy typesoverall a lot of very goodlooking people come here hipstervintagecozy decor checkunpretentious and friendly staff checkknowledgeable and patient staffcheckcool hipster bar area with creative drinkscheckdelicious hearty and eclectic comfort foodcheckbeautiful food presentationcheckaffordable pricescheckcelery root pot pie a pot pie filled with celery root innards flavored with black garlic and topped with gruyere cheese totally yum just get it however if you happen to be a guy with an appetite you might want to order an appetizer to go with it as the portions are those of goldilocks not too big and not too small like some yelper mentioned roasted kennebec potatoes poached egg salad smoked bacon and local greensthis was presented in a beautiful bed of mixed greens topped with a poached egg with potatoe wedges and smoked bacon my date devoured the entire salad and she normally cannot finish everything on her plateeverything from the decor to food was so good and i was gonna give this place stars but seriously the service was topnotch despite the fact that there were only like servers working the entire floor our server managed to constantly check up on us and we were never rushed throughout our entire meal totally winningmake sure you bring some cash with you since this place is cashonly restrooms located downstairs near the bar

elegant chinese food place they even have a coat check what a cool feature other restaurants should take note we were greeted by a host in a suit with a leather reservation book at his desk despite the fact that we were an hour early for our reservation for they were happy to accommodate us the coo in our midst was pleased that he could check his luggage since the tables themselves are quite smallbefore we even ordered there were green beans and noodles delivered to the table presumably complimentary and portioned onto the smaller top of two plates stacked on top of each other we ordered a bottle of red and a bottle of white which were expertly served by one of our many waiters at some point the manager came by to tell us that every server is here to accommodate us so if we need anything we should simply ask everyone was suuper friendly we started with an order of vegetable dumplings and the dumpling sampler shrimp chicken etc each dumpling appetizer had six per order being that i was a vegetarian the restaurant served each of us a mixed plate with of course only vegetable on mine they were steamed and soft but didnt fall apart when lifted off the plates with chopsticks the dumpling sauce was yummy but a bit watery i liked the fact that the table setting included both chopsticks and forks no presumption or shame either waymy dinner order was the vegetable ratatouille big chunks of tomato and broccoli and onion over thin pasta strands yum we ordered a side of spicy broccoli for the table and that was really delicious we left so stuffed that we needed a walk afterwards extra opportunity to talk with the coo thanks chin chin
ugh you guys why do i love all the speakeasies all the time its like a weird addiction whatever so i went here with a friend after work we both live nearby and we thought we might try it i figured we flat out wouldnt get in becauseyou knowspeakeasy and all that jazz there were definitely four to five other people milling about outside since we were about minutes early before they opened for the night this isnt my first rodeo i will say i have never been to the original location so i dont have much to compare it to but i was pumped up anyway i love love love sasha petraske so how could this possibly be bad my friend and i were greeted by the friendly host and seated right away at one of their tables up front perfecto as is the milk honey tradition we were not given menus only asked what sort of cocktails we love most i went with my classic ahhhh i love old fashioneds a little sweet cardamon clove cinnamon flavorsyeah the mixologist had no problem at all creating something i loved which is no shock to anyone that has ever been mixed a drink by one of sashas mixologists that guy doesnt mess around with his staff my friend loved her drink too we sipped on a few more each time the mixologist changed up our drinks slightly which kept it fresh and interesting and our waiter would explain all the ingredients in detail and how it was crafted so i loved it so much i went back a second time which comes as no shock to any of you this time with the same friend shes so fun we sat at the bar this time and had no problem getting a seat she was considering it for a private party so we looked around the back room which is super cozy and great our drinks this time were just as good as the first time and completely different which i love i went back a third time for my aforementioned friends birthday party she had rented out the back for cocktails and small bites what a pleasure they did have menus this time but with the basis for all their cocktails you could order off the menu or have them craft you a personalized cocktail shockingly it didnt take forever for your drink to arrive either which was awesome the staff was so friendly and nice everything we asked them for they provided we brought in our own cupcakes which they happily served on platters the food was very simple but very tasty actually really smart drinking food miniature sandwiches with prosciutto and brie and others with apple honey and brie there were also salmon deviled eggs and a bruschetta but those sandwiches were pretty good nothing too special but good little bites to help soak up all that bourbonsmart bar bites and amaze cocktails are completely my jam so now im coming up with reasons to throw my own party there asap its so good i have to go back again and again the struggle is real
honestly i cant say anything more about this place that hasnt already been said the staff really is super attentive and they make huge efforts to make you feel special i came with brian m in the middle of a snow storm and wore rain boots on the walk there and had to change into heels in the restaurants foyer thank you emp hostess for not making fun of me or making me feel like a total moron they kept wishing us a happy anniversary the whole night and i swear they must have googled brian because they remember he worked in the same building as emp weve both been to our fair share of michelin restaurants in nyc and emp is definitely in the top three the amount of work the staff puts into explaining the dishes and the time they take to lay out the silverware in between each new dish is extraordinary i accidentally moved my fork and someone immediately came over to put it back into its proper place i kid you not this may all sound super uppity but the earnestness of the staff makes it feel completely casual in a way i never once felt uncomfortable even though im sure i was sitting close to some crazy high roller on a date who kept ordering bottle after bottle of wine at the end of the night they gave us mast brothers chocolate covered pretzels to take home i devoured mine right away and attempted to steal brian ms as well before we left our waiter came by with a box full of the chocolate covered pretzels for us to take home amazing i put those bad boys in the freezer when i got home and had one before bed with a glass of milk and dreamed sweet dreams of the menu
ive never felt such a sense community at a restaurant this may be because of my enthusiasm and anticipation after reading marcus samuelsons yes chef two years ago but i doubt it id like to think that i would have caught onto his fusion of his own cultural experiences immediately we dined during the world cup and there was soccer paraphinalia everywhere a jazz band played as the game broadcasted on a tv just above their heads i sense everyone felt the same because we struck up a jovial conversation with the table next to us who offered me one of their deviled eggs super good after i lamented not ordering them in the first place the menu caused me to furrow my brow a bit as i decided amongst all the options we settled on shrimp ceviche the dirty rice app lamb tostadas and catfish the lamb tostadas were my fav the lamb was braised to perfection i will be back for the harlem chowder though
when i was doing my morning walk to the subway a few weeks back it wasnt the unassuming red awning that caught my eye or the fact that yet another restaurant slide in this case had bit the dust it was the name of the eatery soon to be replacing it old tbilisi i rubbed my minds eyes in disbelief whaaaaa a georgian restaurant on bleecker street for many years and until the last couple youd have to go to kings highway avenue u or brighton beach in brooklyn to get some decent georgian food not counting all the pansoviet places that infuse their menus with dishes from the caucuses but signs dont lie not with the rents you pay to open up a business in this part of town ever since that day i kept watch on the windows watching old tbilisi gestate from occupancy permit to posted menu to this past week open for businessas soon as i saw the open doors and the waitstaffwell waiting for diners in the doldrums of the very early evening i lined up the so and my brother for an exploratory trip as soon as we entered we were told that they didnt have their booze license yet in case that would influence our decision to partake we went in with this very expectation but i appreciated the full disclosure im sure it saves restaurants aggravation with folks complaining after they sit down it should be noted that there is no byob option due to recent changes in the law which i have seen with other places that opened in the past year but they will have full booze soon they already had a couple of diners there and luckily there was still room in the nice garden in the back we walked past the bar area and long dining room some changes have been made since slide times there was a large stone waterfall fountain that actually looked fairly real these can look quite tacky sometimesthen our feast began my brother was there for one thing above all the khachapuri they have a couple of varieties but the one he wanted was khachapuri adjarian straightouttheoven georgian bread with an open lid in the center filled with delicious sulguni cheese topped with a poached egg whisk it around the waiter will show you to create the delicious mishmash that makes this georgian calzone one of the tastiest things on the menu of course we also noshed on other tasty appetizers starting with a basic tomatocucumberonion salad one of my all time favorites then a very good dish of marinated zucchini eggplant and peppers and finally some obligatory khinkali georgian dumplings we got the porkbeef variety but you can go for lamb too youll get three oversize dumplings the spiced meat encased by thick teepees of dough otg offers spices and flavors new and old its hard to think of a more authentic purveyor of georgian food in the boroughs at least one that ive come across there is much more menu to explore in old tbilisi and i will be back as long as they stick around fyi they should have their full bar up and running in a couple of months but if you care more about food than booze now is the time to check it out
very cool experience we got gala tickets for sunday at they stagger the ticket times but its all the same show so i definitely think it makes sense to just book the earliest entrance time possible to spend the most time inside the ticket says dress to impress the queen so it was very cool just to see how dressed up my fellow new yorkers were definitely a nice chance to pull out something formal or crazy or furry or sequined from your closet the men were almost all wearing suits and tiesi think everyones experience inside will be a little different immediately after going inside i got pulled aside by an actor to a tiny room where he gave me a palm reading and a little sparkle sticker on my cheek with a note to deliver to the bartender which in retrospect i should have read but didnt my boyfriend got pulled aside too and kissed on the neck and had his hand drawn on comes into play later in the show by some womanthere are lots of drinks ready at the bar i picked up a pink champagne vodka honey drink that was delicious there are some hors doeuvres going around too if youre hungry had an amazing deviled egg and mini foie gras donut there are various acrobatic acts going on in the center of the room before the real show starts theres not as much to explore as sleep no more but we did wander behind the stage into an entirely wax room with a topless woman in a bathtubthey kind of randomly grab people and seat them once dinner time starts although theres clearly some reserved seating for those who have the more expensive tickets the show consisted of either dancing or acrobatic acts that come together into a vague story about the queens daughters initiation actors will come around and dance around you or whisper to you or touch you during the show too so theres definitely more going on than just on the stage at one point i got hoisted into the air to assist in the chinese yoyo actfood was delicious our table had the cage of lobsters they were probably the most enormous and tasty lobsters ive ever had a little messy to eat in your nice clothes but they do provide bibs lobster crackers and forks and wet napkins we also tried some of the paella which is what vegetarians get and suckling pig from nearby tables my favorite part was the end where everyone gets up to slow dance so its a really nice date idea to go as a couple and then got fed bites of awesome dessert
at first i couldnt understand why kung fu tea would want to open a new store location right next to tea kettle and across the street from coco all bubble tea spots but it makes sense now im no bobabubble tea connoisseur but ive had my fair share of boba in this city i judge my boba based on how good the black milk tea is and the consistency of the boba it needs to have the right texture and chewiness without being mushy of all the boba tea spots in nyc i have to say kung fu tea is the best for nyc this new location is much bigger and definitely much more comfortable than the last location on street this location has indoor and outdoor seating and the best part is theyre open late i can finally satisfy that midnight craving because this location is open til just as the other locations you can control your sugar level and ice level to your likingsome of my favorites at kung fu tea are black milk tea green milk tea and the grapefruit green tea happy bobaing bobalife
this restaurant lives up to its name its the only wings restaurant that is truly international because of all the flavors that they offer i wish i had tried this place before the superbowl cuz the wings are so damn good this is not some random wings place in a sports bar the owner head chef is actually from the culinary institute of america and he makes all the sauces himselfin addition to the usual bbq sauce for your wings this place has exotic flavors such as spicy thai with basil or even vietnamese chili mango my favorite sauce was the mexy q imagine a delicious rich bbq sauce with a nice mexican chile kick to it i also enjoyed the garlic parmesan beurre banc which balanced out the mexy q because it was lighter you can opt for boneless wings or wings with the bone if you dont eat meat fret not they have vegan nuggets and turkey wignettes now lets talk about french fries you cant have wings without fries what makes the fries so special here is once again the different flavors i had both the normal fries and sweet potato fries yes i know all of you out there love sweet potato fries you must try the indian masala fries which were delicious where else are you gonna get masala fries we also had the pepper parmesan fries and southwestern make sure you get some dipping sauces they taste even better when dipped in ketchup or chipotle mayo a lot of people ordered take out from here but if you decide to sit in here and eat let me tell you the service was amazing we were able to speak to the head chef himself and he was able to recommend various sauces based on your personal preference he was also very friendly tooi cant wait to come back hereps they deliver too
bestpancakesevereverever ive been here a total of times in the last years and each time it never disappointed four of those visits were for pancake month and ive been fortunate enough to try some of their awesome flavors crunchy banana pistachio frangipane fresh coconut blueberry crumb streusel swedish apple and wild maine blueberry pancakesjust for those not in the know every february is pancake month at the bakery and every few days they serve a different flavor some are served day some days and some even days the bakery operates from opening on weekends and for the people who work during weekdays and want to try it out i recommend that you visit on a weekday for dinner a line usually forms at about ish but if you get here before youre almost guaranteed one of their seats when they open anyone not within the first wave of guests will usually have to wait about minutesas for the pancakes the serving size is big with pancakes and you can easily get full just off alone if you come here with a guest its best that one of you get the pancakes and the other get some other item so that you can share usually many guests will split the pancakes and also split an order of chicken waffles which is also incredible clinton st bakerys fried chicken is some of the best ive ever had the skin is super crunchy and the meat is very moist you can see the moisture on the meat the second you peel the skin right off of them the meal comes with pieces of chicken so be assured you will be stuffed from all that chicken plus a giant wafflenow back to the pancakes they are amazingly soft and fluffy with the topping usually covering about half of the top pancake included with every order is a small cup of warm maple butter if you thought the pancakes couldnt get any better the warm maple butter yes its as good as it sounds add another layer of richness to it when you slice off a piece of the pancakes and dip it in that warm goodness the pancake melts in your mouth its very addictive and that might be an understatementout of the pancakes ive tried so far ill have to say the crunchy banana might be my favorite its got a beautiful balance of sweet and sugary flavors with the banana and cinnamonchocolate sauce the warmness of the sauce is such a good compliment to the pancakes i feel theres a really good balanced flavor for this pancake because no one flavor dominates the pancakes and you get a good taste of the banana as well as the chocolate syrupi cant say enough good things about their pancakes and if you dont believe a word i say give them a visit the pancakes really do speak for themselves as real words cant do those fluffy saucers justice update i came here recently for the time since their expansion and what can i add that i already havent said about this pancake haven yes their pancakes are still the best as i recently tried their japanese pumpkin pancakes which were absolutely as delicious as ever the pancakes not only had pieces of pumpkin on top but they also had filling inside as always the pancakes were fantastic and still the best ive ever had yes ive been to cafe luluchowever this updated review is not to shower more praise on their pancakes but i wanted to touch on the awesome expanded restaurant they opened up on the corner of clinton and houston streets the expansion of the restaurant was a brilliant idea there are now about more seats than the original restaurant which is awesome it just feels like there is so much more space almost double than the original location the original location is still operating but i heard that it only opens on weekends the tables in the new location are not on top of each other and there is plenty of walking space in addition its very clean and simple and looks like it can accommodate parties of all sizes with the amount of booth space they have im glad to see they didnt try to squeeze in every possible table and seat allowed insideim not sure when they made this change but they now open at for dinner so for those who can get out of work and head straight there its perfect you dont have to wait outside in the freezing cold specifically during pancake month we arrived around on a thursday and there were only a few people inside unlike the old location the restaurant didnt fill to capacity until around and even then the table turnover was quick the service in the new location was excellent still the dining area area was dimlylit and the kitchen is actually exposed so you can see the cooks at work in addition i love the new bar area as you enter the restaurant it has about seats and is perfect for single diners or people who prefer to sit at the barsame ol pancakes and service but a better home now
i absolutely love this place it is the epidemy of an english gastropubs without all that english plague vibrant food mulled wine the spotted pig is buzzing each night and you are bound to run into someone here with that in mind prepare in endure long waits and cramped seating definitely a place for some mean eats dont be confused with the menu here just know that this establishment belongs to that british subgenre called the gastropub a bar serving simple straightforward food however straightforward at the spotted pig means traditional english food transcending into an italian twist and for those of you who rather prefer to drink your dinner their bottle wine list and casks of beer will warm your soul also a great for brunch with the standard west village brunch prices but where else can you get gingerbread pancakes with a light vanilla cream candied almonds and a blizzard of powdered sugar or their deep fried poached eggs with chorizo stew did i mention their fried duck egg with ramps and anchovy dressing or their two poached eggs with roast pork hash damn im hungry again
piora was simply amazing and i had a wonderful time at this cozy restaurant in west village with my friends the restaurant newly opened under the command of simon kim the restaurateur and chris cipollone an amazing chef our experiences here could not have been better the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating providing an impeccable service the bartenders were amazing gotta try the sake nog and the food was fantastic no wonder why piora received so much publicity and was raved on magazines restaurant reviews and newspapers by so many the ambience was just perfect for a small party not too loud but intimate enough to really have a nice meal with friends with the beautiful lighting in the back of the restaurant i would highly recommend this place to couples as well for those who want a meal under a more casual setting please feel free to sit at the bar to enjoy your meal with a friend or even by yourself in any way this small restaurant can fit all our meal started with the complementary starter potato truffle soup which was tasty and followed by monkey bread sweet potato barbeque octopus and carrots my favorite was the carrot which was so unexpected the yogurt sauce blended well with the carrot and created perfect harmony it was certainly a new taste simple and elegant barbeque octopus was also amazing with an interesting twist i definitely sensed the korean element in this dish which was done in a contemporary approach the texture of the octopus was great sauce blended well and wonderfully presented sweet potato which is common in korea was perfect just the way it should be and it brought out the nostalgic feeling in me monkey bread with seaweed and rosemary lardo butter really kicked the door open for our demanding appetitesour main dishes were bucatini and rohan duck which were both out of this world bucatini with dungeness crab black garlic and chili added a light scent of spiciness to the dish while elevating the beautiful mixture of garlic and crab taste into a perfected crafted pasta rohan duck was quite possibly the best duck dish ive had in new york the jujube sauce and the tangy flavor created harmony with the richness of the duck it was just perfect we finished our dinner with a mango sorbet w cotton candy that was not only beautiful in presentation but also heavenly in taste mango pieces chopped with mango sorbet basil sauce creme and small meringue pieces was delightfully light and refreshing i am looking forward to come back here to try out other dishes as well my dining experience here was amazing and i cant wait to see the new menus that will be rolling out as the year goes also shinya yamao is also a key attribute to this wonderful place as his charismatic presence parallels his skills for the most wondrous drinks if you are not looking for a meal feel free to swing by and sit at the bar for drinks you will be pleasantly surprised thank you piora

i am pretty much am all about brunching in tribeca on the weekends i mean im kind of lazy and there are just so many amazing choices to choose from just down the street from where i live locanda verde is a must for this weekend favorite meal my bestie and her bf have been here before and they always wanted me to try brunch here finally just this past saturday we were able to secure a coveted reservation and headed over after a late night on the town just a few hours earlier the inside is simply beautiful jon and i totally fell in love with the decor here mirrors that reflect the natural light from the outside cool lamps and an awesome bar that was lit up on each shelf awesome there was also a really cool chalk board with the pastries and specials near the cafe area now onto the food some of the portions could have been a little larger but i have to admit everything was super delicious for the table we started with the sheeps milk ricotta with truffle honey and burnt orange toast this was so amazing and was definitely a great way to start the meal kellys been here before so she opted for trying something different from her previous visits the hour tripe and fried eggs jon is a pancake kinda guy so he had the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberries and meyer lemon curd im not huge on pancakes but i can agree that this was simply heavenly the lemon citrus sauce really gave it the extra pow lastly kelly suggested i try the uovo modenese with cotechino hash spinach and tomato hollandaise not only was this so pretty to look at on the plate it was one of the best brunch dishes ive ever had i love eggs and it had the perfect tomato and veggies amount to balance out the sausage although the bill add up quite easily here if you are looking for an impressive brunch with amazing food and good service i suggest you quickly make a reservation and enjoy the best weekend meal here
diners beware you will leave here in a full on meat coma i dont know how i stumbled upon the cannibal i think i typed in dinner outside in flatiron and voila it came up in my search and i am so glad that it did i met up with one of my best friends for dinner here last night and we feasted i arrived first and sat at the bar they have a very extensive beer list and quite a few wines to choose from i let the bartender choose for me because i found him entertaining especially when he asked the other bartender if he peed when there was a wet spot on the floor once my friend arrived he ordered a beer and we sat outside the seating is semicommunal and since we were a party of two we shared a table with four guys no big deal we wanted to maximize our meat sampling so we decided to order a few smaller items instead of going with the apparently infamous half a pigs head which i will be trying next time when we come back with more people we started off with the ham plate which was basically three different kinds of piggy it was divine i love ham next came the bone marrow which kind of grossed me out because that is the part of the meat i avoid but i did dip some bread in the juices after my friend ate all of the marrow and then finally came our delicious jalapeno sausage ummm yum this was the best sausage i have had in my entire existence so good and i cant wait to try the other kinds we also threw in some broccoli rabe for good measure but its not really worth mentioning because it is not meat and who cares it was a vegetable and it tasted fine the vibe here is very laid back and not like most places you find in the area considering flatiron is basically full of pretentious people and wannabes trying to be cool i would come back here and would recommend to anyone who loves meati gained today but it was worth it

prosperity dumpling is about as good as it gets for cheap food in nyc usually you get cheap or you get good or some pseudo mixture of the two but rarely does a place provide the best for the leastmy standard order is orders of fried dumplings plus a sesame pancake this is exactly these fried porkchive dumplings are just like my family makes from scratch in china very authentic not too greasy perfectly fried and the right size the sesame pancake is light and crisp on the outside light and fluffy on the inside you can even spend a few pennies more and get it stuffed with some meats and veggies there is always a line out the door but dont fret as they are very quick the constant and predictable hoards of hungry patrons ensure constant and predictable cooking of dumplings its just like how two bros always has pizza right out of the oven because they always have customersif you follow my reviews you know i am a nut for good value and prosperity dumpling is the leader of the pack when it comes to bangforthebuck fill your belly for and go home happy after visiting one of nycs bestextra points if you grab the bag of frozen dumplings to make at home
im not especially christian nor am i a good person and my past reviews with their paragraphs of implied debauchery could each serve as their own first class ticket to satans lap if i believed in any of the old or new testament i would say that after i die you will find me plopped upon his knee postmortem stabbing myself with a crucifix but instead i can tell you that you can find me here and surprisingly often and all of this even while i am still very much alive shocking yes in new york we all seek sanctuary in places that shield us from the chaos and manic energy and noises that we call home these places are called bars but sometimes you need a little more like an actual sanctuary i make a habit of parking myself in a pew during any given nonsunday usually for no more than thirty minutes at a time when i leave i feel refreshed not for any religious reason but because i was able to think clearly without my brainwaves being intercepted ten billion times by anything and everything whirling around its a huge beautiful space quiet clean free and almost always empty i dont know another place in downtown manhattan where you can find thatand if you decide to turn my secret thinking place into your secret thinking place as well turn your cell phone off thanks
montmartre is fantastic i came here with my girlfriend on a saturday night looking to satisfy a french food craving and montmartre definitely delivered we had a reservation for and when we arrived we were promptly seated and excited for a delicious mealwe were pretty hungry so we went for three appetizers the french onion gratinee the steak tartare and the sunchokes i love steak tartare so i had to order it even though we really came to try the other two dishes it ended up being the perfect amount of steak not too little that would make me crave more and not the sometimes over the top amount that other places serve the dish can sometimes end up being a little much but montmartres was right on point it satisfied my craving and i still had plenty of room for the other two appetizers the french onion gratinee was awesome i had never had a french onion soup with oxtail in it the pairing was phenomenal the oxtail was cooked perfectly very very tender and dont worry no bones to worry about and the flavor paired perfectly with the rich onion and the melted cheese this is definitely worth giving a try finally the sunchokes were amazing they had so much flavor and was a great vegetable pairing to go with our other appetizers the flavor of the vegetable came through the glaze to make what was definitely a refreshing dish and a great preparation for our main coursesfor our entrees we chose the arctic char salad and the brandade tartine the arctic char salad was much more impressive than we were expecting it was a multifaceted meal that paired arctic char with mustard greens and also acorn squash with wild rice the arctic char and the mustard greens sit on top the pieces of cod were cooked a little more than seared but not quite rare this gave the fish a firmer texture for the salad while still maintaining all of its flavor after working your way through the arctic char and mustard greens youre still in for a treat the acorn squash is delicious when paired with the wild rice on a dish that i was already totally satisfied with this extra feature really put it over the top for us not to be out done the brandade tartine was amazing heres how the dish was set up the brandade was spread thick on a piece of toast and topped with a heap of ham roasted red peppers and olives when i was considering ordering the dish i was a little worried that the brandade might be a little too salty for me but it wasnt at all the light seafood flavor of the brandade paired perfectly with the ham and each piece of red pepper came through with each bite i wish i could eat a sandwich like this for lunch every day aside from the great food which was already a huge win the service at this restaurant was impeccable each time either of us had gotten up someone had folded our napkin for us whenever any member of the wait staff not just our waiter walked by they would make sure our water was topped off and cleaned up all plates we werent using since the restaurant is on the smaller side this kind of service made sure your table wasnt overly cluttered with plates we still had plenty of room to move around even when we had three appetizers on the table simultaneously i highly recommend checking out montmartre it was an amazing experience that i cant wait to have again
judging from the openingweekend crowds theres a massive pentup demand for stylish glasses that wont break the bank i thought warby parker was a little too hip for the upper east side but i was very very wrongthis retail spot is so new that you can still smell the paint its located in the old lascoff pharmacy building which is a yorkville landmark the renovation retained the huge windows and the mezzanine but replaced the dusty interior with something that feels like a cross between an apple store and a gentlemans librarythe staff are delightful helpful efficient and fun at first glance they seem like nothing but hipster models for the frames but it turns out they know what theyre doingpros all frames out on open shelves for you to try on lots of staffers asking if you need help all frames and that includes regular lenses progressives are an extra these prices are a gamechanger in the industry eye exams available for an additional which includes dilation if you want it upstairs offers cushy seating and free candy and souvenir erasers stamped with inspirational james joyce quotes at this point i was overcome with a powerful urge to live herecons it takes business days to get your glasses but theyll ship them directly to your house i cannot actually live here

with very limited exposure to filipino food jeepney perfectly served up a wide sampling of dishes and let me know that i need to seek it out far more oftenthe incredible amount of people both inside and outside jeepney on a wednesday should have been the first tip off to its popularity but after coming in on a whim i didnt know what to expect the menu is filled with traditional dishes that range from bone marrow soup to fresh seafood ribs and various rice disheswith such limited knowledge and unfamiliar names of dishes we asked our waitress for a walkthrough of the menu and she provided excellent descriptions and recommendations based on our tastes her patience and enthusiasm for the food and our first time trying it was infectious and we ended up ordering nearly everything she recommended our meals included the chori burger voted one of the best in the city and theres a reason for it coconut rice and bbq ribs im not always a fan of trying others dishes but found myself unable to prevent myself from digging in on my friends food we came on a wednesday night and got to witness the magic that is kamayan night a wildly popular eatwithyourhands feast it looked so fun that we already made plans to go back and try it with our friends i can hardly think of a more authentic and original meal than ive had at jeepney and i cant wait to bring more people here with me to experience it
awesome quaint little spot in the village we came on a tuesday for lunch and the place was full always a good sign we were lucky to be sited on the little outdoor terrace it was so nice on a beautiful day the food menu comes on a little post card thingie i appreciate the small menu it makes it easy to read to choose and to get together we started off with sharing the duck rillettes delicious very little portion but very delicious and very authentic the bread that comes with it is rustic toasted and drizzled with olive oil yumminess of crunchiness i had the prosciutto parmesan steamed eggs with toasts it was very good i love the simplicity of it all the steamed eggs reminded me of super fluffy scrambled eggs the prosciutto was paper thing and the cheese not overpowering again the bread was toasted rustic and lightly drizzled with olive oil quite delectable all together my friend had the croque forestier with mushrooms of course i stole a bite it was so good the cheese the stuffing anything with mushroom has to be yummy the portion was big you get two sandwiches with the order value wise the croque may be the best bet for your buck the staff stellar everyone was smiling very friendly very attentive and professional we had a great experience and i will love to go back soon and try out different croques
anniversary time is here and that means its time to look for that perfect giftfortunately i knew she always wanted a pandora bracelet but finding a dealer nearby was sort of challengingi came across this store on pandoras website and decided to give it a shotupon entering i was assisted by robin who was extremely helpful in finding some great charms and bracelets that would suit my ladys preference she was very patient about my questions and really did a great job of explaining how to build an attractive bracelet after checking out a bunch of samples i was able to purchase a set that made my lady happy when i gave it to herwhile i was in the store i had a chance to check out their other merchandise they had a nice selection and it was good to see that they offered attractive jewelry at reasonable prices with the pandora items being the same as the list prices on the companys website what really is good about this store is how friendly and accommodating the folks are i wasnt sure if the length of the bracelet i purchased was appropriate and robin told me to come back if the size was too big two hours later we came back to exchange it for a smaller size no questions asked i also ended up buying two more charms simply because i was impressed with their servicein the future we will definitely back for our upcoming pandora or other purchases at this store its nice to see a jewelry store that really treats their customers right and doesnt push people to make any purchases it made the entire experience very comfortable and hassle free

note this is a review for the office escape game its a rarity when my high expectations are met or exceeded and escape the room nyc was definitely one of those rare occasions reserve a ticket on eventbrite friday through sunday times only each time slot will hold up to people once there youll take an elevator to the floor of an office building and wait for all members of your group to arrive youll be trapped inside of a seemingly normallooking office room however there are hidden objects to be discovered and codes locks and puzzles that need to be solved using the creative brain power of the people in your group youll have an hour to find the key that unlocks the main office door to make an escape youll also be given two cards that your group can turn in for two clues clues of the game masters choosing at any two points within the hour since the room is currently being shared with a graphic designer there is a small section of the room that isnt part of the game where you will put your coats and bags in addition the game master will actually be in the room with you and give you the time remaining while also silently noting the genius and notsogenius parts of your escape plan the clues were very challenging and it was such a thrill to work together my competitive spirit was definitely released every time we made progress we all clapped and yayd in unison my group was unfortunately frustratingly disappointingly not able to escape though we were pretty close i do think as brian r mentioned that people may be a bit much the room is large enough to fit everyone but with so many people talking at once it was a bit difficult to know the whereabouts of certain clues without having to shout or ask multiple people likelihood of another visittheyre actually going to rent out a new space in the near future where the rooms will contain revolving bookcases and more exciting features i cant wait to try out the new venue second note theyve already expanded and have two additional games the agency and the home
is sun vin grocery indeed an anagram of nervous crying well one cold winter day i was almost in tears after being unable to locate my favorite ginger milk tea at some of the holeinthewall grocery stores on mott street only to find it within minutes in one of the many fluorescentlit relatively spacious aisles of sun vin just a short walk away on mulberrygrocery shopping is an unpleasant chore but sun vin makes up for the mundane nature of the pursuit with its colorful assortment of fruit drinks pocky sticks teas candy and gummy snacks drawn from china indonesia thailand and parts of the world where the purchasing power of the dollar is still not deserving of mockery i even found those tea cups that i bought at the french concession and tianzifang in shanghaithey are fully cheaper at sun vinthe checkout experience is nononsense and quick even if not friendly interestingly every item in the receipt simply reads groceryso much for sku data and upc codes then again i quite like the abstraction especially when what is concealed in the line items is my shameless love for cloying candy and sugary snackswe have a winner in sun vin i shall be back soon

great place awesome location in alphabet city which makes barhopping easy lots of food lots of beer and an amazing variety of both i love spots with great craft beer so naturally it is my goto spot when in the area spitzers has two bars main one and another one in the back room its can get a little crowded and its sometimes hard to find a spot to sit if youd like a table you might have to make a reservation of some sort great place to come with a small group though since seating may be a little tightbathrooms are located downstairs which is nice because they are away from both bars and all seating theyve been pretty well kept every time ive come here also if youre looking for something to snack on get the sweet potato fries one of the best ive ever had

in a city where every establishment vies to be the best and everyone is jaded towards anything less than extraordinary rarely do i find myself truly surprised anymore my entire experience at employees only surpassed everything i expected and morefirst off the bouncer excuse me doorman that evening was one of the friendliest guys working a door ive ever encountered he needs to be cloned and have his clones distributed throughout meatpacking district to replace all of the other bouncers and doormen for realsgetting inside only took about minutes on an obviously busy saturday night and the whole time we were chatting it up with this man once inside the palpable energy was uplifting and all consuming talk about an upper as my eyes darted around the dimly lit interior i fell in love immediately with the modern art deco feel which i took as a small homage to prohibition times true this bar is not a legit speakeasy but you would probably walk on by if you didnt know any better there is no sign saying employees only just its symbol in the shape of a key on the awning plus a neon lit sign in the window saying psychic you can usually just spot it by the line outside on an otherwise quiet blockthe bar area was unsurprisingly packed i noticed a small dining room area in the back for those who wished to avoid the livelier scene up front hey im sure its more intimate but screw that like a highly renowned sushi restaurant the bar is the place to be you should want to be up close to smell the action watching the bartenders work their magic and their hard biceps is the new female aphrodisiac move over oystersnow im not going to lie trying to get a seat at the bar can be a little bit of a game and dance but the amazing principal bartender signaled to me when a couple was about to leave i then hovered like a pretty vulture to get the highly coveted seats staring down anyone eying my spot dont play the musical chairs game with me because i will win as sheldon would say this is my spotfor drinks i started off with the billionaire cocktail because lets face it im a balla this yummy concoction was made with bakers bourbon shaken with lemon juice eo grenadine absinthe bitters my next beverage which was bartenders choice had a dash of black pepper on it cant remember the name of it but i know bourbon was used my companions also had a few drinks of their own and thoroughly enjoyed them as well i might have had a third cocktail but nothing ingested that night was less than delicious this statement does not only cover the beverages but also the food as wellwith great drink comes great responsibility to eat lest you become a mess i had to have the bone marrow poppers which in a nutshell are flaky little pastries topped off with dollops of fatty bone marrow goodness so delectable we also ordered the braised octopus with roasted fennel celery green olives delicious tender octopus with the perfect flavor i feel like most places dont get octopus right but eo thoroughly nailed it with thors hammersince im always craving raw meat i knew i had to try the handcut steak tartar now ladies we all know when weve had something good and we have to have it again the steak tartar was no exception i got it twice let me see if i can describe this act of culinary foreplay bartender brings forth a bowl of diced filet mignon which is so red and juicy looking next he starts pointing out to me various ingredients that will go into the bowl im thinking oh great i get to mix my own tartar nope wrong the man mixing my freaking awesome cocktails is also mixing my raw meat in front of me i think im in love verdict it is honestly one of the best tartars i have ever had no jokei cannot rave enough about the quality of the bartenders here not only does it seem like they are personally attending to you amongst a crowded bar but their obvious dedication and love of their craft is so wonderful to watch by now its obvious that i will be coming back for more libations scintillating conversation what is it about speakeasies that makes me want to talk about sensual subjects and mouthwatering dishes i have found a new bar obsession and its mine dont bother meside yes they do have a psychic there on weekends for a great deal of madame whatsherface will read your palm fortune i will not discuss the enlightening predictions she bestowed upon me insert sarcasm here but let me warn you now that it took a week to scour those damn purple marks off my ive heard through the grapevine that the reason its named employees only is because back in the day it would only admit people who actually worked in bars in nyc so in essence this place used to open its doors to only other bartenders and bar owners hence the name employees only
ive hesitated to write a review for aj out of sheer timidity but feel free to judge if you cant handle a woman who likes a good sex shopaj is a perfect example of what an adult store experience should be its so easy to feel uncomfortable in these kinds of stores and maybe even a little embarrassed but like the other reviewers i can honestly say that ive never felt more comfortable generally welcomed in an adult store before the mom son duo who run it are very professional friendly and caring mom who runs the lingerie section is knowledgeable about her products and will help you find the right size in anything what i love most about this place aside from the experience are the prices i really doubt that you can find better deals anywhere else in the city ive had a few conversations with the son and he always tells me that yelp has been a godsend for their business so i knew i had to add to the already stellar record in hopes of drawing even more customers even though im not often in the market for lingerie i think that this is a great business that will be around for years to come
ive tried acupuncture all over the city and while ive experienced some positive effects i have never felt transformed afterwards in my experience it usually involves speaking to a practitioner for five minutes being poked with needles and left alone for fifteen minutes then being sent on my way all that changed after i started seeing finbar im an athlete and a dancer so i run into bodily injuries here and there this past spring my back was in bad shape and went into spasm i could barely walk without pain and definitely couldnt arch at all i had a competition approaching and needed to recover in time for it he worked on me by using massage techniques acupuncture and recommendations for herbs and other natural remedies i started improving within days and slowly regained enough range of motion to compete and take placeive seen him for many other ailments as well he is unique in that he listens genuinely cares for your well being and offers affordable rates for detailoriented service im not saying that people should replace traditional medicine with only natural therapies to heal i believe in a combination of western and eastern medicine but if something can help without causing negative side effects why not try it i highly recommend you try finbar
whats up with the sizing here the smoothies are huge unless you forgot to eat fruit for an entire week you can probably split one and save yourself the sugar rush all kidding aside juice generation is one of the better juicesmoothie stores in ny and it is always an excellent experience coming in and out of these stores i think they go heavier on the bananas compared to other stores since most of the smoothies have a thicker than usual consistency which is great because i love bananas and it holds up better in the summer heat
the food touches the heart it is hot and ready to serve all the food is in a hot window buffet style and most of the food seems to be stewed aside from the whole fish food like this makes you think of flavor and a lot of loving put into it i had no idea what was on the other side but the lady serving me put me on to all the choices i opted to go with the stewed chicken and stewed beef it was served with white rice a stewed spinach some kind of peanut based sauce and a sweet root vegetable it had the consistency of cassava but it was sweet the food was mildly spicy and delicious loved it going back or the lamb stew
welcome to paleo or primal heaven i heard about this place in the paleo blog world so had to check it out when i headed to the city this past weekend it was everything i dreamed of and more these guys created a pretty freakin cool place for anyone who wants to find real clean food on the go even if you dont follow a paleo dietthere are about different counters to order from including a coffee bar mash bar hot counter and prepared foods sectionthe coffee bar had all different organic coffee offerings on their milk bar they even have homemade almond milk and coconut sugar next you have what they call their mash bar which i didnt spend too much time at it looked like they had some pretty awesome fresh juices smoothies and different types of concoctions with ingredients like grainfree granola chia pudding almond butters etcwe headed to the back where the hot breakfast section was i ordered a bowl where you can choose quinoa or root vegetable mash as the base i got the vegetable mash topped with veggie medley and an over easy egg my boyfriend got the primal french toast that was drizzled with cashew cream and syrup with blueberries it was ahmazing we also got some of their grassfed bacon on the sideon top of all of this there is a prepared foods section from there we got some grass fed meatballs to take home i also bought some grain free raw granola that has made for a yummy breakfast this week and to top it off we had to try a paleo treat we chose almond butter trufflesoh my godjust take my word for it and buy theseokay i swear im not being paid to write this review i just loved it that much

awesome place for live music i love coming here mondays theres the terra blues band that plays weekly a group of my friends come here sometimes to do blues dancing a partnered dance style ou can comfortably fit couples to dance in the bar part by the entrance while the band plays their minute songs the staff is pretty nice and i have a large amount of respect for people willing to move gracefully around us dancers and still be friendly to us they are also really quick on serviceim not positive about this but i believe the band records every time they play to keep track of what works and what doesnt so they are constantly paying attention to how their music really affects the audience
absolutely amazing i was lucky to join a rouge tomate gift cardtoting friend for dinner here and oh manso damn amazing we indulged in the tasting menu and opted for the wine pairings option as well no not the cheapest outing but this is not the place to be frugal note if youre a pescatarian or vegetarian fear notthey will gladly substitute the menu items as necessary each course was better than the last each wine paired perfectly with our food and when all was said and done we were completely and utterly stuffed the staff was incredibly professional and attentive and the actual space is dim minimalist yet lovely random unimportant bonus points the sinks in the bathroom are pretty damn cool if youre interested in a gluttonous inexpensive feast this is not your spot if youre looking for a wholesome filling unique combination of flavorful healthy faire though yes pricey in a classy yet chic atmosphere then make a reservation yes recommended clean yourself up not the type of place you wear jeans to and prepare to have an amazing meal
im a huge fan of hard cider but niche brands are difficult to find in new york cityi checked on beermenuscom for a seasonal variety docs draft cranberry spice hard apple cider and discovered that it was available at noble grainslocated on a side street off avenue on the ues you wouldnt even know it was there unless you came looking for itthis tiny shop whose inventory is quite the opposite of tiny offers a grand selection of craft beer gourmet food and cideri got two cold bottles of my seasonal cider which id be hard pressed to find elsewhere they even had the pumpkin cider which i havent seen anywhere including the winery where its made since the falli had to use tremendous willpower to not buy a of the mckenzie black cherry cider from buffaloservice was incredibly friendly and approachable from the moment you enter i felt like a kid in a toy store where unique toys were all at my disposali love that they keep their list on beermenus completely will certainly be back for sure
after living on the uws for almost two years i must now say that fairway is hands down the best grocery store in the neighborhood yes the layout is an insane maze there are basically three stores in one gourmet regular and organic once you figure that out and get a plan for where you buy each item its pretty easy to navigate their prices are insanely good on some items greek yogurt for example the selection is really incredible considering how small the actual store is and there are idiosyncrasies i still to this day dont understand why i have to empty my own basket but i still love fairway more than any other grocery store
this place never ceases to amaze me i still live nowhere near berkli parc but hardly hesitate at the thought of making my way down to the les for some coffee shop time here its been almost a year since my first visit and it still feels like home to meunlimited access to wifi amazing food the blta wins em all although everything ive ever had here is superbly above par great coffee beer and wine perfect mood lighting and in a great neighborhoodberkli parc is as reliable and consistent as they come this is truly a gem
i love this breakfast brunch spoti first went to their original location and returned with visiting family to their new spotthe food is delicious the pancakes with their strawberry butter are to die for i dont even particularly like pancakes but something about this combo really set it righttheir egg and omelette dishes are also very goodi also really enjoyed their bloody marys with lots of fun garnish options begging to be tried the jalapenos or strips of bacon garnishes are my picksthe decorations inside are also fun and homey farm animals galore

i took a long hiatus from yelp bc it was getting wayyy too repetitive writing review after review of the same thing my creativity to explain delicious food good service can only go so far which is why i went from yelp enthusiast to ughhh no more however brunch at feast revived my desire to share all the goodness that comes with nyc brunch feast was uhhmazing its cozy rustic free was legit especially on a cold nyc weekend our table was a repurposed antique sewing machine the pedals were right by our feet so adorbssome people in our party were late but no one at feast made a fuss or seemed to care even though they were busy the brunch comes with a drink entree an array of apps we were given a bread basket yogurt parfait carrot juice shots potato tart besides being beautifully presented it was super fun for all of us to have little tastes of everything its a really great way to start off your brunchall of the entrees are just the right size without making you fall over with the itis the whole brunch experience was filling but at the same time light enough for you to walk away to enjoy the rest of your careful sunday afternoon my smoked salmon was so delicately prepared with pieces of trout poached quail eggs i thought it was delicious but i dont think i would order it again but quite frankly i can get smoked salmon at a lot of places what i did love was my friends souffle pancakes and i wholeheartedly dislike sweet entree dishes it was so incredibly fluffy a true blend of pancakes and a airylight souffle all of us had to stop ourselves from stealing bites of hers feast is a charming place to dine with friends youll leave filling full having tried a variety of eats chatting in a homely rustic decor and not suffering from itis
everything about this place is perfect lovely atmosphere not too uptight and not extremely casual definitely still fun great service our server was really friendly and informative we asked him a bunch of random questions about the food and he tried answering most and he was really awesome about it also we arrived early and were served drinks while waiting that was great and of course the amazing delicious fresh food we ordered everything appetizers raw oysters entrees and dessert everything was amazing you cant go wrong the spicy tuna tartare was amazing whenever i order tartar even at gramercy tavern i cant really eat too much of it because it gets sickening after a while but this i could have kept going i just wanted more it was so refreshing and it went really well with the vinaigrette i usually dont order fancy asian dishes but the grilled yellowfin tuna sounded so good i had to order it it turned out to be perfect it was light and flavorful the tuna was grilled just right it was amazing i ate every bite of iti highly recommend this place and i have to come back again soon
i came for a friends birthday and i thought everything was fantastic from the food to the service to the ambiance having lived in the city for a little over years now i dont think ive ever had true comfort food as good as this little gem they have root beer on tap and a variety of other delicious cocktails and you get a lot for your money i ordered the mushroom gravy chicken biscuit sandwich the biscuit was so delicious flaky and warm and need i say huge the chicken was well cut and fried it came with a side of cheese grits which i also loved i think the highlight of my dining experience was when i asked for hot sauce and they said they only carried sriracha you know that when an establishment only has this magical red sauce youre in a good place
aangan is hands down my favorite indian food place in new york dining in the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful the atmosphere is comfortable bordering on romantic and service is quick and unobtrusive your water glass will always be full even if you dont notice the guy refilling it and the food is delicious honestly ive probably eaten half the menu at this point and cant say ive disliked a single thingcarryoutdelivery the best generally very fast and everything gets home hot and delicious the portion sizes are out of control seriously they give you an entire togo container of rice for each dish ordered no need to skimp while youre eating you will not run out of rice chicken khorma is definitely my favorite but everything i delicious two thumbs way way up for aangan they have never disappointed me
i cant rave enough about this place seriously one of my favorite spots to grab food in the neighborhood hands down my favorites are the stewed pork hamburger which he makes fresh on the spot and is perfectly flavored and tender ive also become a huge fan of the cold skin noodles which are refreshing with a great mid spicy flavor their dishes over rice are absolutely the best i recently tried the beef over rice and it definitely didnt look to be the most appetizing dish ive ever seen but the taste was simply out of this world and my bf and i literally finished every drop of ricethe beef had been stewed for a while extremely tender and well flavored it was cooked with flat clear noodles winter melon and some red peppers he also asked if i wanted it to be spicy and proceeded to add some hot pepper oil which only made it better not to mention his dishes are ridiculous cheap for the area and so deliciousthe only downside is his sometimes unpredictable schedule last time i asked him when hes there and he said that hes usually there between and everyday except for saturdays however ive been there during the times hes supposedly there and to my disappointment he was nowhere in sight
le bernadin lived up to my expectations it was the freshest fish ive ever eaten and complimented perfectly by sauces and wine pairings the wine and sauce never over powered the fish i did the chefs tasting with wine pairings for i chose this because it had more courses and it included seafood that i preferred to eat it was fish courses and then dessert courses each fish course was different with a very different sauce and a different white wine this is the tasting menu to do if you are a seafood lover if you live for red meat and wine then you may be disappointed i am a dessert person and i always leave expensive tasting menus disappointed in the dessert course but both of these dessert courses were very goodthe service here was also impecable if i just motioned like i was going to stand up someone would come over to pull my chair out for me a jacket is required here for men and once you are inside you will realize why
i got out foodie by a nonfoodie how does that work its called magic i love good surprises i really do big balloons pleasant shouts from random strangers a highfive guess you can say ive always felt really comfortable with a bright light shoved in my face well takashi you did not disappoint i was craving korean and well nonfoodie says oh ive been here its really good just matteroffact like grabbing a sammie at subway or something so im thinking its another rando korean restaurant cool beans ugh no its frickin the most amazing food ever its anthony bourdain all day everyday twice on sundays so the menu is not for the faint of heart literally they serve all kinda of animal body parts soaked in the most delicious sauces and grilled to perfection for example the fois gras with chocolate sauce booyah short beef ribs buns w scallions and love topped w this spicy mayo daddy and of course the most juicy slab of prime beef bbqed in front of you the waitress cooked it because we were lazy and she did one heck of a job if i wasnt drunk off two nyquils and full i could have eaten that entire thing mind you we were not that adventurous eating here but people sitting next to us were eating all kinds of meats and lovin it ive just never been a huge fan of intestines hearts pretty darn tasty chicken butt excellent but brains and livers unless its duck not really my thing yes its a japanesekorean fusion place the menu is extremely creative and if youre a foodie or even if youre not but like to just put things in your mouth thats what he said takashi is worth every bite out foodied by a nonfoodie and i was pleasantly surprised fistbump worthyyyy bow
oh mercy i love me some fine dining i really do i am such a sucker for the service and the pulling out of chairs and the way the champagne bottle is wrapped in a cloth napkin everything is just sofancyi would give asiate stars if i could make that an option i went for my anniversary this past saturday night i was married at the mandarin oriental exactly one year ago so it was fitting that we return for our first anniversary dinner we arrived about minutes early and were seated anyway as we walked in i loved the modern feel the clean lines the massive double height floor to ceiling windows that made the city your decor which is basically why we decided to get married there we were escorted to what i would call the best table in the house it was in the front in the corner so both seats had deadon gorgeous breathtaking views of columbus circle and street snow covered central park was so pretty and even the glowing red lights of the cnn sign are so iconic to new york immediately our server came over with prosecco turns out my mom had sent it as an anniversary present it was poured perfectly and we were off to the races with our menus even the bread was ridiculous i chose the olive bread loved it crispy and had a faint enough olive taste to not be overwhelming oh goodie that means the best is yet to come we took our time with the menus and i decided on the winter truffle risotto with the extra black truffle supplement because i was feeling all sorts of fancy i also ordered the duck breast for an entree i almost never order duck but i figured if anyone would do it right asiate would before our appetizers came the catering manager james munz from the ballroom one flight up came by to say hello to us we had asked for him when we checked into our reservation he told us that one year ago our altar was positioned exactly above this table my husband rolled his eyes as his heart is clearly made of cold hard stone but i literally melted right into my ivory upholstered chair dont judge me i hate pda and almost never hold hands but it was my anniversary for the love of god come on you all know you would have felt the same way so now i am completely swooning and loving my husband more than ever at this moment he can thank james later and i have some more prosecco and our appetizers arrive listen you guys you have the go for the black truffle risotto you dont have to get anything else to eat just that i grew up eating my moms risotto and have a great affinity for it but this was better apologies mama but seriously thanks for the prosecco this was the best most perfectly cooked aborio rice ever and if you have ever attempted to cook risotto my word its challenging but the chef at asiate is some sort of risotto genius it had a bunch of very large pieces of shaved black truffle on top all lined up in a neat little row my supplement i had almost forgotten in the prior lovefestyou know how some dishes are just lifechanging i will never eat risotto the same way again nay i probably wont eat it again ever it wont be good anywhere else i contemplated asking for more bread to sop up the remainder of the dish but you know i had my hair done for the occasion so it was pretty special i should act as lady like as possible my entree arrived i was a little bit concerned since i had ventured out on a limb for the duck breast since i dont even really remember if its something i like turns out i love duck breast oh wait i mean i love asiates duck breast mercy me it was the god damn best cooked duck breast in the whole universe the outside was crispy and delicate the meat tender and flavorful with miniature brussel sprouts all roasted on the plate and a sauce a red wine reduction maybe it might have even been a hoison sauce glaze of some kind and i just flatlined right there why is the rest of my life worth living after a meal like thisdessert came which we didnt order but i think it part of the prixfixe meal it was a sampler with about six little options like ice cream and chocolate cakes im not really a dessert person and i really liked the dishes but nothing stayed with me like that duck and risotto they also brought another dish which was a flourless chocolate cake that was completely gorgeous and extremely delicious with happy anniversary written in chocolate on the plate really nice touch i want to apologize for such a long review but really sorry im not sorry because there is just no way to convey the way the heavens parted and angels sang while i dined its worth noting the incredible friendly and accommodating staff very professional not at all intrusive but we never wanted for anything if you splurge on one meal this year or in the next five years make it asiate its totally completely utterly worth it
i have made it a rule not to review restaurants where i am an invited guest today i am making an exception eleven madison park at the southern end of the original madison square garden is the perfect location for a new american but truly international dining establishment this is truly one of the best restaurants in both new york and the country i have always said that it is about the food but let me say it starts here with the atmosphere and service which is unmatched in nyc i love the spacious tables and the old school space worthy of commodore cornelius vanderbilt himselfthis is a perfect restaurant for a romantic rendezvous or a marriage proposal the caviar appetizer was exquisite and the warm salad with mushrooms pine nut and kale combined a wonderful presentation with a medley of fresh rustic flavors my main course of roasted beef with root vegetables and black truffle was truly memorable it was perfectly seared retaining its flavor and cutting perfectly the dessert was very flavorful and subtle tart tatin with hibiscus caramel and creme fraiche ice cream worthy of paris france eleven madison park is truly a special place worthy of the annals of madison square garden it was a perfect place for me to connectreconnect with many other double hoyas if you are looking for a classy but friendly location this is the place
starscrispo is also one of those places thats deceptive when you enter its a narrow bar dining area but keep walking youll notice a few tiny nooks with seating tables a corridor where theyve fit in some tables and then finally it opens up into this rustic wonderland where its christmas all year round the lighting exposed brick and fireplace makes it one of my favourite spots to dine at during the winteri must have eaten here at least a dozen times it feels so comfortable to me its almost home and thats probably why i havent even reviewed it so far i know im not making a dent in the of reviews here but i have to say this crispo always feels like one of the most underrated restaurants i have been to i dont hear much about it its always easy to get a reservation and here it is on yelp with reviewswhether your party is big or small whether it is date night or an office party crispo will fit your bill they have an array of appetizers like the bone marrow to appease the ardent meatlovers while still having enough on the menu to cater to the discriminating vegheads i love the caprese here and their tomatoes seem juicy tart even in the dead of winter they also have a lovely brussel sprouts dish with almonds ilili and alta set high bars with their brussel sprouts so this one probably comes third in the race among their pastas they have a beautiful whole wheat spaghetti with raisins and cauliflowers a winning combo and their black truffle ravioli always makes me want to lick the plate clean and sometimes i do so sue mein the dessert department the only one that has captivated my taste buds so far is the cheesecake being italian of course they use ricotta instead of creamcheese giving an amazing texture and the taste goes beautifully with strawberriesbecause of its perennial availability on the reservation front crispo tends to be my go to option on several occasions and that i am so grateful for

back in my nyu days i used to walk around in this area quite often in search of the notorious num pang sandwiches although there are a few other italian restaurants in the area da andrea and vapiano to name a few none do the craft quite as well as allonda the hype is realprior to my visit i made a reservation at but as dinner with friends sometimes goes a few of us namely me missed the minute grace period of our reservation the hostesses were really nice and sweet and offered us a seat at the downstairs bar or the dining area near the door that was fine with me because our server kat was the sweetest person ever she kept checking in on us on drinks and appetizers before the last of our friends trickled in i ordered the brussel sprouts and cocktails for us the basil gimlet being the most memorable it was a tasty cocktail with basil syrup in it what better than things that i love mixed together basil and alcohol an unusual but very tasty mix the brussel sprouts were cooked really well in a mixture of honey curry and pistachiosfor our entrees we ordered the lumache a lobster risotto the rigatoni duck ragu and chocolate in a red wine sauce and the infamous bucatini an eclectic mix of smoked uni and spicy bread crumbs atop pasta the lumache had a rich creamy texture and the chunks of lobster were a good addition to the dish my friend liked the lumache the most but i didnt find it to be nearly as delicious as the other two dishes which were packed full of flavorthe rigatoni was my favorite dish by far the rigatoni pasta was cooked perfectly to an al dente and the sauces were flavorful but not overwhelming the duck ragu was irresistibly tender and the portions of the protein in this dish were generous the chocolate was very faintthis was my first time trying uni so i had no idea what to expect the bucatini had a smooth buttery texture that was paired really well with the spicy bread crumbs this was a wonderful mix of sensations that was a delicious experience to eat the pasta noodles were again al dente but a little softer than the duck ragu which added to the buttery texture of this dish overall i was really happy with this experience everything from the service to the food to even the hidden bathroom on the first floor was absolutely fantastic its a really cute place for a girls night out or a date heck i might even bring my parents here when they come and visit
zie ga zink sammy i have been plotzing and plotting for over a year now for a night out at sammys after my parents came back raving when my girlfriends mother was looking for a place to celebrate her i eagerly pushed for sammys i am glad i didnt end up looking like a shmegegge because we all had an amazing time lets start with the decor messy dark and cluttered youll feel youre basically in bubbes bosom sitting at long communal tables decorated with pitchers of shmaltz and antiquated seltzer bottles youre transported to a homestyle bar mitzvah from yesteryearthats no reason not to get fapitzed though girls come wellheeled and men groomed so be sure not to come in any old shmata the food here gets high marks for pushing the limits you thought your waistband could expand chopped chicken liver served up in a huge metal mixing bowl delectable kreplach latkes to die for garlicky beef sausages and some of the juiciest skirt steak youve ever had to name just a few dishes all this as i took shots of ketel which is served in a giant block of ice if youre a health nut stop being a pisstachio and just ride the wave of fat with glee is this the best and most finely prepared meal youll ever have no but thats what makes it authentic this is real jewish food done the right wayso why is sammy my culinary beshert because of dani luv oh what a shayna punim he is the lox to my bagel if youre a person who gets offended easily then leave your tuchas at home because dani doesnt pull any punches he puts on a spectacularly hilarious cabaret performance complete with traditional jewish standards and american classics youll be dancing the hora around the tables learning the original version of if i were a rich man and laughing so hard that you might burn off a latke or two what i loved best though was the fact that dani really plays to his audience and off of them we were a table full of russians as was another table that night he joked that there were more russians than humans that evening for a majority of the night he played all of the classic tunes we grew up on and really made us all feel such nachas as for me i will gladly come back to sammys and dani luv for another night of hard belly laughs and dangerous cholesterol levels

only been here for brunchmultiple timesagave is a mexican style restaurant in the heart of the village just off christopher street and ave south they have an aycd brunch that is damn good though only if you order off a specific part of the menu read must have eggs been here with both large groups from to and smaller intimate brunches that are just the two of us that said every time i go to agave it is always an amazing experience with attentive servers that generally make an effort to actually refill your drinks on unlimited brunch to excellent food i usually get the sunrise burrito energy breakfast or egg white frittata i guess it depends if im trying to be healthy that day or notthe bottomless beverages only last two hours which is really plenty is until and includes choice of mimosa wine champagne or margarita it appears theyve raised the price by a few bucks as on their website its posted at i think it used to be or something so its just a few extra bucks their guacamole and soups are good as well but i usually stick to just my favorites its really hard to steer away when they are that goodhighly recommend agave for brunch
look beyond the flappy plastic on the door meant to keep the cold out and the strange alien on the sign which might become kind of endearing because right when you walk into siggys youll feel like home when possible they ask you where you want to be seated i love sitting in the back closer to the fireplace the lighting is comfortable and cozy and the decor is bright colorful and tasteful take a visit to the bathroom to read some inspirational quotes from martha graham and mlk jr not too long of a visit since its a onestaller the food is organic and healthy ive tried several of their soups and they are delicious try the option of adding quinoawhen i called for delivery they were so polite and honest about how backed up they were they apologized and said it would be quite a long wait and i loved that they were so sincere about it they have healthy brunch options and are very accommodating when it comes to making the plates vegan the quinoa spinach cakes are delicious i cant wait to come back and try their smoothies yay siggys with your outofthisworld food yes allusion to the alien intended
if you can request the table in the kitchen sounds weird but it was a cool experience it felt like a tv show or magazine setting you are literally almost in the kitchen but far enough where you can talk without shouting close enough where you can see the action and chefs at work as a starter i ordered the burrata with prosciutto the burrata was just how it is in italy soft on the outside and super creamy on the inside so it oozes out a little when you cut it the prosciutto was sliced very thinly and was very soft i ordered the ravioli raviolo since there was only one with the quail egg i compared it to the one at armani and it is just as good just different says a lot since im obsessed with the one at armani truffle butter and the egg was very runny and everything was just the right amount of messy soft pasta cooked just right creamy cheese with just a very very small amount of spinach insidetried the tiramisu and chocolate cake chocolate cake had the soft melted hot chocolate on the inside not too spongey on the outside again just right taste tested everyone elses food and there wasnt one thing i disliked preferred some things over others but thats just personal taste service was also excellent overall amazing experience the table in the kitchen made it that much more special
one of the best omakase experience that i have been to in nyc yetbyob with no corkage fee they will have ice buckets ready in front of your seating arrangement reservations recommended way ahead of time if you want to go on a weekend dont expect a high end venue expect a legit hole in the wall sushi bar but of course it is cleanits hard for me to find amazing sashimi in the city unless you spend on it nothing compares to the good quality at a price like in california but tanoshi is a different story omakase that will actually fill you up for around is a bargain in the city their fish is amazingly fresh and hits the spot every time i take a bite out of the sashimi they serve their rice and fish at certain temperatures and even funny will recommend you to eat your food right away or else itll taste monkfish liver the foie gras of the sea as they call it the texture is definitely similar but not as melt in your mouth goodiness creamy scallops my favorite appetizer it definitely had a creamy texture it was full of flavor and i wanted more definite torched big eye firefly squid first time and it was so white albacore uni with quail egg the egg definitely made this more spicy tuna hand albacore salmon red miso soup placed in a shot freshwater marinated futomakiextra black king fishawesome service awesome price first omakase to make me full what a bargain for sashimi in the city highly recommended
my dad used to sing a song to me when i was a little girl supposedly its from wwi man my dad is old anyways it went how do you take em back to the farm after theyve seen paris that is a perfect way to describe my experience here how am i supposed to eat anywhere else after ive had the deliciousness that is aurora we started with wine because of course the first bottle was from a vineyard in tuscany that aurora has a special arrangement with they only produce bottles of this wine per year and we had one of em talk about making a girl feel special then when we finished that bottle we had the wine that julia roberts liked so much that she agreed to endorse it for free in the movie eat pray love that bottle was even better than the first yumwe started with the artichoke appetizer special omg the artichoke special it was flavorful and tender it is the monster under my bed that causes dreams about it every night since trying it and im not even a huge fan of artichokesi arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early so i sat at the bar and mingled with the other patrons secretly pressing them for information on what to order lo and behold i managed to find an offduty food critic sitting at the bar what luck she suggested the purple haze see my pictures and the paccheri alla norma thanks to her for both the purple haze beverage had a really fresh flavor to it im always concerned that colorful drinks will be too syrupy the paccheri alla norma was another winner many italian restaurants rely on the deliciousness of cheese to win you over on a mediocre dish here at aurora the cheese was really secondary and the chef allowed the eggplant and tomato to be the focus of the dish highly recommend we stayed here for hours and i dont regret any minute of it a little bit hidden away and hard to find but it makes you feel like youve discovered a secret place all your own it is the paris of italian restaurants this makes no sense at all and yet it does it so does
weve been meaning to try out this place since my sister has been raving how great the original location in queens was we finally made way on a friday night the wait was not too bad we waited about for a table of not sure of all the dishes we ordered by their greek names since we had a actual greek person wus we let him order veggie chips wtaziki dip this was yummy their taziki dip was very refreshing you can taste the freshnessoctopus this is everthing so good the octopus is so soft not chewy at all our greek friend told us the process to make this since his parents make it as well the balsamic and olive oil they used goes very well wthe octopus this is a mustlemon potatoes this was good but nothing amazing if you love potatoes order it greek salad i learned that a real greek salad never has lettuce in it this salad definitely does not have any leaves in it chunks of fresh tomatoes blocks of fetas olives cucumbers and a little bit of olive oil so simple yet so delicious definitely a must i can see this being very refreshing on a summers dayred snapper we ordered this wout the bones it was prepared perfectly not too fishy great wthe side of lemon potatoes our waiter was somewhat amazing we ordered everything in greek he repeated it back in greek and he didnt even write anything down however he got everything right he didnt miss anything pretty amazing overall this is a great place for a nice healthier dinner dont forget the free dessert its tasty kinda like a bread pudding wpastry on it very delicious on the house i cant be mad at that
nice japanese restaurant where for once the main focus isnt ramen sushi or curry this place serves solid traditional japanese food i find it amusing that this place is classy and slightly expensive when ootoyas in japan are cheap and considered fast food still this place is well worth your time and moneythe staff is very polite and make the dining experience very pleasant i love their interior decorating its very elegant with a mix of traditionalmodern furnishings it is dim inside but that adds to the dining experience the restaurant is deceptively small the small entrance makes it seem like it can sit only about people but it leads to a bar and quite a spacious dining area with upstairs seating still this place is quite popular so you might have to wait up to and hour on a thursday or friday night other nights they have little to no wait unfortunately they only accept reservations at night which is a downer for those who work latethe sets consist of a variety of small items which may look like not a lot of food first but is actually quite filling these are the setsitems ive tried so farika shiokara sliced raw squid cured in salt and a squid liver marinade if you are not a fan of squid or anything slimy avoid this dish fortunately i like both this appetizer really packs a punch i found the liver marinade extremely acidic and salty with a very peppery taste the marinade also gave the squid a slimier texture comes in a very little bowl so not sure if it was worth the yuan the yuan sauce complements the grilled mackerel very well the side of ponzu sauce they give you also tastes great with the white rice the set comes with pickles kabocha squash miso soup steamed egg and grated mountain yam the mountain yam Â±±Ëó• san yao in chinese has a weird texture when grated and raw tastes a lot better in soup or stirfriedtori yuzu kosho the chicken thigh is very small but the but the yuzu citrus pepper and sauce is amazing sweet tangy with a bite from the pepper it has a kind of jellylike consistencykatsu toji tonkatsu soaked in the soy sauce broth and was covered with scrambled egg really great flavor but the breading was kind of soggy i understand thats the nature of that dish but a little crispiness would have made the dish even better eat this with rice to not waste the delicious soy sauce brothhomemade tofu very soft and similar to the cantonese dessert douhua except maybe the soybean flavor is stronger here it comes with salts this was good but i probably wouldnt order it again despite its freshness and it being homemade it really is just tofu with fancy salt chawanmushi despite all the positive reviews of this im actually not a big fan of their chawanmushi true it has a very soft texture but its almost too soft and feels more like those japanese pudding cups than steamed egg it also has a plumlike flavor to it which makes it confusing whether its a dessert or noti would love to come back to try their yakitori and get more of their katsu
jon and i stumbled upon or into but that part is a mere matter of opinion taqueria diana late one night after a friends birthday we were on our way home and walking to our car when we passed by this tiny little taco spot the waiting ordering area is very narrow but there is just enough space to place your order your food despite many people being ahead of us in line the wait was short and we were quickly served our tacos on metal plates the guys here were really friendly and made our food very fast we made our way to the back where there is limited seating honestly the price is very reasonable for you get two tacos this was absolutely a great way to end the night we fully enjoyed our tasty tacos with onions and lime and the pork beef meats that we chose im not often in the east village but when i am i think i will definitely be back i cant say no to delicious and cheap tacos especially after going out
what a speakeasy is supposed to be hard to find location and bespoke cocktails mixed by masters of the craft i was seated at the bar in front of victor you know how professionals make it look effortless well that was victor no tasting exact pours double fisted cocktail shaking and mixing it was like watching an artist paint i started with the paddington i wanted something fruity to cleanse my palate after destroying myself with a bacon wrapped hot dog and cheese fries at crif dogs it was perfect it contained banks island rum lillet blanc lemon and grapefruit juice orange marmalade st george absinthe i loved it the marmalade settled to the bottom and gave it a sweet finish but i wasnt done yet next i ordered the shark to keep the rum theme going plus rum is my best friend its made with butter infused bacardi silver rum wray nephew overproof rum frangelico blue cur√ßao lemon and pineapple juice cream bittermans elemakule tiki bitters its blue how can you not love a blue drink this one was even better than the paddington the overproof rum made it i wanted another one but note they dont serve watered down drinks here heavy pours and lots of liquors two just became my pdt limit now i kinda wish pdt wasnt located inside crif dogs i want to get dressed up and come here without smelling like fried food its quiet sophisticated and too pricey to be juxtaposed with cheese fries and rootbeer floats uh oh one trip to a speakeasy and ive become a total snob
if there is one thing to be said about hidden gems is that you really hope no one discovers them and ruins your new secret hangout close to where you live being that this place is literally around the block from our apartment and down a side street along a spot on the upper east sideyorkville part of town it seemed like a place that only a few locals would know about its in a barren stretch of an area that really needs an influx of new specialty bars and eateries such as this and is a welcome addition to the neighborhood alas now that we have been here a few times and are fast becoming regulars we see that everyone else around here has also found out about drunken munkey its now at that point where you need a reservation to get in the crowds have slowly discovered this wonderful new indian craft cocktail bar and restaurant and the adulation is much deservedthe drunken munkey i really do love the name of this place is being billed as new york citys first dedicated craft cocktail bar on the upper east side they serve a selection of classic cocktails wines spirits and cordials along with offering comforting dishes of indian style cooking the decor reminds one of a throwback to the times of colonial india with a generous touch of the legendary flavors and style of famous cafes and supper clubs you used to find in old bombay its a cozy but whimsical spot with an affable owner terrific staff skilled mixologists and downright delicious food how can you go wrong with that well you cant and drunken munkey is helping to usher in a new generation of affordable upscale eateries and cocktail emporiums to this barren stretch of the ues we need more flavor up here and it is a delight to see it has arrivedits the kind of spot that once you get there you settle in and never want to leave warm and inviting to help battle the cold of this long winter it fits like a comfortable set of gloves that you dont want to take off its a place that i can see as a date spot or for friends and family to meet up at for a dinner over spitited conversation or for those just looking to have a few cocktails and a bite at the bar in a lively environment with such attention to the little things you will see monkey laden images and statues along the bar mini bicycles along the wall shelves grainy black and white photos of old bombay cricket ball bathroom door handles and even the waitresses are dressed in churidar kurtas giving off such a cool ambiance to dine and enjoy the one flat screen they have features bollywood movies and indian programming while the music playing in the background features an eclectic mix of old jazz to and hits indian tunes to some rock somehow it all works here can be a bit loud and boisterous at moments being that it is a small space but that just adds to the funas for the food now that we have dined here a few times i can say it really is delicious and i think i might become an indian food addict here we started of with an appetizer of paani puri crispy flour puffs aloo chickpea chaat with tamarind mint water something i never had but was oddly good and fun to eat okra was off the hook crispy okra onions tomato chat masala these are dangerous mine mine all mine my preciousthe butter chicken tikka masala is a classic comfort dish and they do it right everything is served on one large plate which makes it all too easy main course raita ghee rice kachumber and some perfectly fluffy naan mmmmmi could eat this every day that soft tasty chicken that creamed tomato sauce oh my no really i could eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner dont judge me if an indian restaurant cant do tikka masala right then i avoid it but the munkey has an experienced chef that is a master at what he does the libations here are nothing to sniff at as they list a classic offering of old school cocktails for served in ornate glassware the bartenders here are killer and mix a mean drink pimms cup singapore sling east india cocktail royal enfield sidecar old fashioned among others help quench your thirst with a generous pour and enrich your soul even if you dont eat here it is a destination spot to drop in and have a drink to end your night or start it off dont forget dessert gajar halwa carrot pudding crushed nuts cardamom coconut creme is something that doesnt sound right but makes an amazing sweet concotion to top off a meal here just so good listen to me and get it youre welcomei think i will become fast friends with this drunken munkey he taunts me with awesome drinks and delectable food he lives right around the block from me and might become a bad influence you know how those monkeys are

man i love mancora although i commonly mistake it for the the mancala game or the macondo aycd brunch spot i still know this little corner spot in east village has the best ceviche ive ever had and that includes the amazingbutcontaminated real thang my friends and i paid the price for in cuzco and lima you wont find better bang for your buck the various mountainous rawesome entrees at mancora are officially the only ceviches that will completely fill you up and at only or so each the norte√±a with a variety of fish and shellfish in a flavorful tangy limetomato sauce and fresh avocado wins by a landslide with the mixto de mariscos a shellfishonly specialty bathed in a simpler lime juice base in second place although their house hot sauce is nowhere close to mamouns on the scorch scale it has some bite and im a fan while the ceviches take the cake the skirt steak with fried egg is a bit hit with mis amigos and the pisco sours are amazing and great on the wallet at a pop the appetizers are not to be missed particularly the grilled octopus and calamari the octopus in panca sauce is deliciously tender but not for the faint of heart these little babies are served grilled and whole with tiny tender heads just asking to be torn off their deliciously chewy little tentacle bodies with your teeth after being dipped in their amazing side sauces of course yum mancora accommodates large groups reservations are honored on time and you can typically make arrangements at the last minute its much quieter at lunch or brunch and there are great specials under and loud crowded and more divey for dinner but the delicious food and efficient service never waiver after three years of living in manhattan i decided to have my most recent birthday group dinner here when you just know your meal will be covered by your amazing friends and you still choose this bargain dive spot for your big day that says somethin
the ginger man will undoubtedly become your favorite bar of alltime if you are a fan of beer and i mean beer from all over the world okay maybe you may not like beer but i think youll come to love beer because of the ginger man this bar is just fantastic and its certainly one of the best bars ive encountered in the city from draft to bottled they go beyond domestics and possess a selection like no other perhaps over types of beers are available over of which are on tap aside from having a fantabulous beer menu the atmosphere is inviting warm spacious casual and just perfect for any occasion it does tend to get busy at certain times so getting a table can be a bit of a challenge first come first serve i advise coming here earlier than later especially on an inevitably busy night id say it always gets packed after service is always great though in spite of the bustle their staff is superfriendly and advise on what types of beers to try while they have food it is subpar and average i wouldnt say that is the focus here they print a new menu daily front and back of their daily beer menu they have what seems like an overwhelming list of beers on draft or bottled however they organize the beers nicely they list the location of the brewery the number of ounces served the price the abv and the type ipa amber lager cider etc it takes out most of the guesswork because of how well they organize their list for those who know their beers and those who dont the ginger man will guide you to the right choice of beverage based on your personal tastes my favorite part of this bar is that they serve the beers in their proper glasses even sometimes with the proper brandinglabel on them you wont be sipping out of generic pint glasses or mugs hereall in all the ginger man is one of my top bars in the city i honestly love this place too much its always beyond reliable ive only told all my friends and their mothers about this place and i can tell you that no one ive recommended this bar to has left disappointed they take beer seriously here and if you are a beer connoisseur you will need to make a mandatory trip to the ginger man for those who arent keen on beer they do have a full bar although i cant speak for their pricing otherwise you shall not be disappointed by what they have to offer with regards to beer beer and more beer take my word for it

theres a book i read year ago called the miracle of mindfulness by zen master thich nhat hanh it essentially talks about the principles that govern buddhism the incredible power of living in the moment being fully cognizant of ones surroundings and the details that compose each aspect of our lives its a practice in awareness anyway theres this section where he discusses eating we typically chew fast whether out of hunger or a desire to move on to the next thing in our day or because its what were used to he suggests chewing slowly taking note of each facet of what were eating where it came from how it was made really relishing the sacredness of food as something that nourishes our bodies and is a part of the cycle of life i bring this up because the practice of mindful eating was never something i have personally experienced im a food lover and oftentimes that translates into me devouring my food gobbling up all it sweetsaltylightrichfillingcreamytartacidic perfection my trip to sushi nakazawa was my first practice in mindful eating but ill get back to that in a moment so several weeks ago i received an email from my husband subject this place looks great the body of the email was the link to the now famous new york times review yeah the one that led the new york times to declare sushi nakazawa as the best restaurant in ny for i was aware of the day reservation wait but i decided to try anyway i was desperate for a great christmas present for brian this with only a week left until christmas and still no gift for him i called and a fabulous female british kiwi voice answered after explaining my dilemma she kindly squeezed us in for the following friday at pm he was surprised completely clueless until we were steps away from the restaurant it was fantastic the restaurant is definitely a study in understated and minimalistic elegance there are only tables in the whole restaurant the coveted sushi bar was the first thing we saw when we walked in daisuke nakazawa in the center flanked by his other chefs we were seated quickly at a table the restaurants sake sommelier approached the table to inquire about food preferences and allergies and take our drink orders we opted for the sake special dubbed the best drink deal in ny by adam platt to accompany or omakase the sake pairings were delicious and portions were the perfect size to accompany each dish without overpowering it we were each brought a small dish of pickled ginger the only condiment we would be offered that night one of the servers then brought our first course two pieces of sushi on a rectangular white dish brian and i looked at each other how are we going to get full on this we telepathically inquired we both picked up our chopsticks and started with the sushi on the right initially i chewed slowly because i wanted to savor it in case we wouldnt be getting our next course for a while but then i instinctively closed my eyes i tasted the tartness of the rice wine vinegar the buttery richness of the fish the slight spice of the miso it all melted together down my throat and i was amazed there was no spicy mayo no soy sauce no vegetables or tempura batter or fruit to mask the flavor it was just us and the fish as the courses progressed we realized wed be more than satisfied with our servings at one point i inquired about how sushi pieces were paired together the server explained that like fish was paired tuna roe salmon mackerel shrimp urchin eel im fairly certain they ran the gamut with the selections at one point i inquired about chef nakazawas signature dish the server smiled thats your next course the final course ive never been one for tamago but when it takes anyone years to master something you have to feel a certain giddiness about it it was smooth creamy delicately sweet and a perfect end to the omakase the sommelier returned to our table at this point would you like to revisit any dishes that youve already tried or perhaps continue the experience with some new dishes i felt a little bit like alice with that one how much more was there to try we decided on two additional pieces each or additional the omakase was completed with a sorbet dish served with pomegranate seeds and raspberries as we sat waiting for the check it dawned on me what tremendous confidence chef nakazawa must have in his craft to serve pieces of sushi that are so fresh so superior in quality that he offers nothing else at his restaurant no amous bouche no appetizers no sides no condiments and in truth his confidence is well deserved and fully earned his sushi was the freshest and most delicious in its subtle flavors that i have ever had as we began to walk out i caught chef nakazawas eyes he smiled a full smile one that started in his eyes and expressed deep gratitude at o
it is places like this that make me truly love my city where in the world can you find ethiopian sri lankan indonesian trinidadian food all within a few miles of each otherive had sri lankan food at banana leaf and really enjoyed it so when friends wanted to come here i was really excited about it i didnt know there was another place in the city that serves sri lankan food cool it pays to have friends sigiri is named after sigiriya which is also known as lion rock in sri lanka not sure what the connection is as i didnt get a chance to read the description on the back of the menu sigiriya is a unesco world heritage site cool i also learned something on top of eating delicious food for appetizers we tried the dhal vade lentil patties and fish cutlets although fried both were extremely tasty and came with interesting side sauces for the main entree i had the vegetable curry they have a few veggie choices which included string beans beets and also soy protein you cannot get a mixture and have to order just one of kind of veggie i was a bit bummed about thatto accompany the curry we also ordered a side of pol roti which is a coconut roti but it reminds me of cassava cakes i had in the caribbeans our party also ordered a side of which are waterthin bowlshaped pancakes and the consistency reminds me of a dosa the complex nature of the spices used and the textures really woke up my mouth and i found myself with a mouth on fire for most of the evening even when we asked for mild seasoning it is a great way to drink more wateri truly loved this dining experience and i heard they also have a sunday buffet offering looks like ill be eating here very soon again fyi this place is cash only and byob and seating is limited so it is best to just come with one other person and not your whole entourage

black trees concept is that everything is sourced from within miles of new york city i personally care less about that than the fact that they base their menus off the procurement and utilization of a whole animal when i was there it was cow time and unfortunately all the yummy innards liver tongue etc had already been sold outthat was my excuse to get a hunk of medium rare steak it was more medium than medium rare but still plenty delicious i was happy that the wines were served in glass tumblers instead of wine glasses it reminds me of how i drink neat whiskey out of a coffee mug at homethe vibe is unpretentious and chill but nowhere bordering near twee or hipster a good laidback place to catch up with friends and listen to alternative music
i dont know why im surprised as i am but this place is delicious we ordered the burrata caprese salad the duck breast and the ginger crusted striped bass all three of these items was absolutely amazingto start the burrata was unbelievable its one of the best burratas ive had in manhattan and i wasnt expecting it at all since this is not an italian restaurant the outside was not overly tough and the inside was perfect the right balance between runny and firm the glaze it sat on top of was pleasantly sweet and the basil was thin and delicate combining each of these with the cherry tomatoes surrounding the mozzarella and it tasted heavenly i would strongly recommend ordering this coursethe duck breast was cooked perfectly the slices were moist throughout pink in the middle and the skin was crispy and tasty it came with a nice arugala salad two pieces of brie and some blackberries when i first read the entrees description on the menu i was a little confused about the blackberries but they definitely worked there was something about the savory flavor of the duck breast pieces and the sweetness of the blackberries that when combined made the dish even betterfinally the striped bass the fish was perfectly moist all the way throughout and it was a very thick piece there were no bones to worry about and the ginger crust was really crunchy yet not burned or crispy it sat on a bed of sweet corn and mushrooms that was absolutely amazing im usually not impressed by corn but this was really good the sweet flavor of the corn with the bitterness of the mushrooms went perfectly with the soft tender striped bass i want to recommend this dish too but unless im really lucky everything on the menu at this place is probably amazingone unfortunate thing they no longer offer the bone marrow in place of the bone marrow they are now offering a mussels appetizer instead everything else we tried was delicious but if youre heading here looking for bone marrow youll end up being disappointed

this restaurant is not for youif your interest and experience in thai food is limited to pad thai this restaurant is not for you if you only think of a stop light when it comes to thai food red yellow or green curries this restaurant is not for youif you only eat thai food on a dare or based on the number of peppers on the menu this restaurant is not for youif you judge a restaurant based on the drinks and not the food this restaurant is not for youif youre used to sharing large plates and find small plates as offering ridiculous portions this restaurant is not for youif you judge restaurants serving ethnic food based on how well servers speak or dont speak english or their native language this restaurant is not for youif you find a meal tab of pp as extravagant this restaurant is not for youbut if you want an authentic thai meal can handle spicy food and want to appreciate nuances of flavor and texture without leaving manhattan somtum der is the best option you have showcasing isan cuisine that is now all the rage when it comes to thai restaurants in the city at somtum der you can get some of the best papaya salads som tums and fried chicken in manhattan two versions of the som tum that ive liked at the restaurant include a version with egg thai kai kem that cuts the burn of the chillies and a more complex one som tum pooplara with fermented fish sauce and hard to the point of being inedible miniature crabs the fried chicken sa poak kai tod der consists of juicy thigh meat encased in a crisp shell sprinkled with fried garlic and accompanied by a mild chili sauce its not a dish to be shared and one to be ordered time and again besting almost all interpretations of the dish in the city should you be looking for something grilled as opposed to fried skip the boring skewers in favor of the house special grilled marinated beef nue rong hai der and khao ji the spicy salads larb are also a strong suite and my favorite is the one with crunchy grilled catfish with lime and fish sauces dried chilies and toasted ground rice the rice and noodles dishes may not be the strongest feature still for something different you can try the chefs signature wokfried seafood sukithe range of flavors will ensure that your body movements are not limited to squirming and sweating uncomfortably at the spice level though my lips did go numb after requesting one of the papaya salads to be extra spicy but in case you need to calm the taste buds end the meal with the thai tea panna cotta that comes with a small cup of condensed milk that needs to be drizzled over the dessert while the panna cotta may occasionally lack the right texture its a fine way to end the meal with a light dessert leaving you in the right mood to get back to yelp to rectify the injustice of an average yelp rating somtum der deserves better after doing its best to balance all the crappy thai restaurants in the city that serve meals that range across the spectrum from bland to pepperheads only
eddies is my main draw at the extensive network of shops and restaurants in the concourse at rockefeller centerthey purportedly specialize in a long list of servicessoles heels custom dyeing boot and handbag repair zipper and lining repairs in leather apparel and shoe shines but any casual passerby or serious client at eddies knows that it is all about the shoe shine five chairs thirtyminute wait times twentyminute cleaning service an intense routine involving an array of polishes and rag cloths and service with a smile for a mere i cannot cite a better bargain in the city a minimum wage assumption of per hour would suggest a minute upper bound for the shoe shine and i think eddies is pushing the limit but then not all of the spoils end up with the shoe shine guys so tip them liberally at least or even no one works harder for their money than eddies teamwith ones shoes taking a beating in the snow and cold and given the relative comfort of the concourse in times of bad weather eddies does experience a surge in business during the winter and consequently the wait times are longer but it is all worth it assuming your shoe is worth the shine

ive been saving this restaurant as a meaty reward for my boyfriend whos been very good at eating his veggies in my mind this is the quintessential new york restaurant theres a unique character to the fare meat and beer and bicycles oh my its small and intimate with a heated garden in colder weather the playlist is a mishmash of the greatest artists youve never heard of and the service is absolutely topnotch its a hidden gem in this neighborhoodthe restaurant doesnt take reservations for small parties but on a friday night at we only waited minutes for two seats to open up we were seated at the communal table where i rubbed elbows with my neighbors all night seating quarters are cramped youve been warnedbad news first the restaurant was all out of pigs head which was a bit disappointing since yelpers rave about that dish looking at you xavier good news we ordered the tandoori lamb belly which looked so delectable when plated everyones eyes were focused on our food for a good minutes the entree is designed to be consumed by two people but i cannot fathom how two people could finish all that food the lamb belly is intensely rich and fatty one bite and youve pretty much filled up on your cholesterol and caloric intake for the day it comes with a side of watermelon chili lime salad the crisp flavor of the watermelon helped sooth the fattyness pooling up in my mouthas for drinks we paired the lamb with the gouden corolus dark ale upon our servers recommendation he knew his ish because it was one of the tastiest beers ive had in a while the restaurant also sells the beer it serves so i will be picking up some for athome revelriesnow for the best news service is what bumps this to a star review the staff is friendly so welcoming and so knowledgeable about the dishes the beer pairings and so forth it made my experience that much more enjoyable and im definitely going to be a returning dinerps this would be a great spot for a gentlemens chat over charcuterie and beer in my mind thats the male equivalent of a girls gossip fest over cocktails and tapas
this is one of those times when i actually dont want to review a place because im selfish and dont want it to get crowded but in the spirit of yelpiness and supporting local businesses that deserve to do well heres my five star review for louie and chanintimate dining space and bar area with views of the kitchen rich dark ambiance and decor that feels prohibition eraesque friendly service delicious drinks and amazing fooddining highlightskale saladfried artichokessquid ink pastaroasted artichoke pizza specialhouse made focaccia breadthe lobster linguini special looked incredible and ran out just before we arrived i have faith it was on par with everything else though we couldnt try itthey also have a private dining room just next door and a speakeasy downstairs which i will be checking out this weekchef pasquale made our night even more enjoyable with his special attention and welcoming demeanoreverything about louie and chan is wonderful a great spot for drinks dinner a date or all of the above
food and service was excellent taboon will definitely be a new go to spot for me all of the food we had was excellent the hummus is quite good and so is the schoog though quite spicy we also enjoyed the octopus confitthe pickled salad underneath was noteworthy as well even though that is not usually my thing they excel in seafood here my husband and i both ordered fish entrees and both were cooked perfectly and were quite flavorful and juicy the fluke special was delightful dessert was also delicious we ordered the warm date cake and it was lovely our waitress was great she was attentive but let us linger as long as we pleased she was also very helpful in helping us select wines that would pair well with the food my only complaints were that the portions are pretty small and this place is expensive this is one of if not the most expensive dinner weve had in the neighborhood south of the time warner center we were shocked when we got the bill however the food was quite high quality and the experience was very pleasant so it was worth it in the end
lord jesus for my yelp review i am honored to share with my nine loyal yelp fans a very special place on an unassuming and incredibly character filled span of orchard street sits this little hole in the wall called cheeky sandwiches i suggest you stop whatever you are doing and run to cheeky for the best chicken sandwich of your life you think chickfila is the best this chicken sandwich blows theirs out of the fucking water i will deconstruct the sandwich and then give you a few personal impressions incredible homemade biscuit placed on griddle they also sell just the biscuit with jam in the mornings marinated chicken breaded or floured and then deep fried to red cabbage soaked in vinegar this gives great texture and cuts the cream based gravy put on top of the each element is thoughtful and delicious on its own but put everything together and you are transported to a special placeumami when i die which may be soon if i keep eating here i want to be reincarnated as a kosher chicken gots to keep it real and then promptly slaughtered and made into a cheeky chicken sandwichthat good only for the chicken sandwich and only a min walk from my aptbring on the morbid obesity you dont scare me any place that does not serve diet soda i generally despise as this usually indicates the joint is run and frequented by annoying skinny hipsterstrue this place does not have diet bevs and is owned by a male model but the people who run it are actually really nice and not obnoxious at i have not even tried their po boys yet they have made to order beignets for basically this short clip sums up my feelings about cheeky this clip too nothing to do with this review but it chokes me up every
cool spot tips if you want to go here reserve your ticket online on their website you dont pay online you pay in person to make sure you get a spot sit in the middle section that faces the stage its a much much better experience theres no coat check and the aisles are really narrow so dont come here right after youve gone shopping all day like the guy next to me cheap drinks at the bar the guy standing out front is there for line control not to check your id although hell look at it if you want to show him your super ugly dmv photo its cash only when you get here so bring them dolla dolla bills yall

all of these reviews are like the bartenders are great they shake your hand yadda yadda yadda i have a much better story about the bartenders i wish i had a video of the incident because it is probably one of the best things the best thing i have seen to date in a bar let me set the stage for you it was halloween weekend the bar was crowded but not packed something like pm you might be interested to know they were running some unlimited drinks special something like for hours of aycd they are doing a similar special for nye i was sitting at the bar next to a girlfriend there were a couple of bartenders working one was dressed as batman the patrons were varying degrees of drunk but a very congenial bunch in particular there was one especially drunk banana intent on flirting with every girl there etc he was harmless however there was one weirdo by himself a postmiddle aged man that i would venture to guess was under the influence of something in addition to alcohol he was being seriously weird its hard to describe he was standing behind me im sitting there chatting with batman whos slinging drinks and being very friendly when glass comes flying over my shoulder and smashing into the wall behind the bartender both of us are lucky we didnt get cut the drunk postmiddle aged man had smashed his glass into the brick wall behind me and the shattered glass ricocheted across the bar i cant even tell you how fast so incredibly fast batman raced all the way down to the end of the bar and all the way back up to the front of the pub and pushed postmiddle age drunk guy out of the bar drunk guys hand was bleeding profusely drunk postmiddle age guy was furious but batman ohsosuperheroly forced him out and then slammed the door the whole bar erupted into applause and started chanting batman batman batmanit was pretty epic this is a nofrills kind of place very comfortable not a seeandbeseen place id give it an imaginary sixth star if it would expand the beers on tap or even just switch out the stuff you can get everywhere like guinness blue moon etc for a craft brew or two
dinner at bohemian is one of the most intriguing meals ive had so far in new york bohemian is a secret japanese restaurant hidden behind a butcher shop in noho and the only two legit ways to get their phone number which isnt publicized on their website are to get it from someone whos been there before or email them with a selfintroduction as per the instructions on their site i love japanese small plates style restaurants so i decided to take the plunge and email them directly apparently hi i would like to inquire about making a reservation i have heard great things about your restaurant and would love to visit sometime didnt suffice i ended up emailing them an entire paragraph about myself before getting a positive response and a month later i was on my way to dinner there with three of my friendsafter finding the butcher shop storefront and walking down the long hallway next to it we rung the doorbell and were ushered into a small living roomesque space it was a very intimate loungey atmosphere complete with comfy armchairs and a small japanese garden our reservation was at on a saturday and we were the first people there but within half an hour the place was already filling upwe were too indecisive to pick multiple dishes to order so we opted for the tasting farmers fresh vegetable fondue the server brought the fondue first let it warm up with a flame underneath and then brought out what looked like a forest of colorful veggies planted in ice there were red and orange cherry tomatoes purple carrots bell peppers radishes and purple lettuce leaves the fondue was made of cream cheese and it was yummy and flavorful without being too uni croquette the inside of the croquette was filled with warm mushroom cream and it was topped off with dollops of uni the uni was delicious not too briny tasting though i wish there had been more of it i finished off the uni long before i finished the rest of the washu beef short rib sashimi my favorite dish of the meal a bit of internet research tells me that bohemian actually sources its beef from the butcher shop out front japan premium beef which sells some very high quality and expensive wagyu beef each person got four bitesize pieces and the beef was extremely tender it came with garlic soy sauce for dipping as well as pickled cauliflower on the pan roasted branzini a big dish that came with two whole branzini the fish was lightly seasoned and very meaty and filling there were lots of grilled vegetables with the fish potatoes zucchini brussel sprouts garlic an entire bulb and green beans ikura caviar rice bowl the menu gives you the option of choosing between either the ikura caviar rice bowl or bohemians washu beef mini burger and i decided to go with the rice bowl there was a plentiful amount of ikura on the rice and it was super juicy on the side were cucumbers and tosazu jelly i didnt know what tosazu was so i was expecting it to be something like ponzu but it was much less pungent turns out that like ponzu its a vinegar based sauce but without the citrus flavor that ponzu honey lemon panna cotta the panna cotta itself was amazing super milky and creamy i wasnt a fan of the lemon jelly on top though it was too sour compared with the panna cottas sake panna cotta two of my friends got this instead since our server told us they were running low on honey lemon and asked if some of us were willing to substitute it with the sake one instead it was presented with a shot glass of unfiltered sake to be poured over the plain panna cotta which was pretty interesting great food aside one of my favorite moments of the night was when the manager came over to talk to us he had read my introduction email and proceeded to talk about everything i said in it he also told us a bit about himself too what a wonderful personal touch to dinnerconclusion dinner at bohemian was fantastic and i know ill definitely be back the tasting menu was a good choice since it was our first time there but i think ill order off the √† la carte menu next time to try some of their other yummy looking dishes
hello lover so it was an absolutely freezing evening in nyc i was all hot toddies please but i really wanted to try something new and all my old favorites just get so crowded whats a girl gotta do to get a hot cocktail and a cozy armchair in this city make it herself at home not an option butny mag had done an article on best winter bars so like any selfrespecting new yorker i jotted notes about the best looking places into my iphone i had this little list and picked the third man because it was closest to my apartment and also boasted hot mulled cider i went with my bestie jak we literally couldnt bundle ourselves enough to be warm on the way to the bar but thats okay because once we were inside it was toastycity it was very rustic wood steel more wood a ushaped bar right in the middle and a few cozy boothlike tables spotted around there were two empty booths so we grabbed one it was pretty awesome it was all snuggly and raised off the floor which always makes me feel just a little more tucked away no waitress service but thats okay with me my legs arnt broken the menu had quite a few drinks i would like to try but of course i went with one of my top two winter favorites hot mulled cider with whiskey jak got the same thing it was really really hot we definitely couldnt drink it right away which was fine because even though the bar was super warm my hands were still cold so i wrapped them around my glass when i could finally try it it was really good no frills classic and well flavored it also had a really great whiskey to cider ratio which is always a concern too much whiskey really ruins your hot cider not enough whiskey is a like childs play these bartenders got it rightwe sat for quite some time with our drinks the noise level was low great for conversation but not so quiet you could hear the guy across the room from you sneeze the patrons were friendly everyone seemed to have the same purpose warm up with booze when we were getting ready to bundle up again and head back out into the cold it was definitely far more crowded than when we first got there nearly hours earlier we arrived around on a saturday im a bit fearful about adding another five star review to the third man because ill bet you by next winter you cant get in much less get a table for now i will enjoy the welcomed cozy wintery bar while its still relatively easy to get a table cheers third man you won my hot cocktail loving heart

where do you find the happiest people in nyc jack rabbit sportsi came here because i need to rent a wetsuit we ended up getting everything we needed for a swim the sales people also run swim and bike so they know exactly everything wed need theyre the opposite of pushy so i dont feel pressured to buy anything that i really dont needi found out that they also fit running shoes they have treadmills with cameras attached that you can see how you run so you know what kinda support you need i actually bought a pair of shoes elsewhere and it is giving me some it band issues i went in to ask if i could buy insoles because it would make no sense to buy another pair of shoes for the shoes and i asked if i could bring the shoes in next time and see if insoles are the solution they were more than fine with thatthey have a great rewards program which you dont need a card membership fees or harassment just state your name and every you spend you get awesome free things thats not store credit which prompts you to buy more thingsthere was this one guy whom im sure was his first day on the job who was less knowledgeable on a pair of swim goggles but hes really nice so away
dear katzi have been waiting for years to come to this place in fact i have been waiting for years dont ask me why i waited this long i am glad i finally made it hereit was late at night around from what i recall from my blurred memory i walked out of the club and realized that katz was across the street a minute stumble in heels that seemed manageable i pointed at it and my girlfriends all agreed to go there we stumbled in to katz stood in line to get out tickets and all got our roast beef sandwiches it was surprisingly crowded at i guess all drunk people love to pig out these sandwiches were massive the guy working at the counter was nice enough to let us sample some of the roast beef after picking up my sandwich i made my way to the french fries station and got a plate of amazing fries no the not the limp ones like in mcdonalds these were nice fat pieces of french fries then i made a stop at the beverage station for a bottle of waterfinally i sat down and started working on my roast beef sandwich it was amazing the roast beef was perfectly tender and the greasy french fries complimented it i managed to get through half my sandwich and took home the rest in a take out container then i walked to the cashier and paid almost it was not cheap but well worth itthe next day i woke up with no hangover thanks katz
does the transitive property mean that dining at contra is equivalent to dining at noma isa and mugaritz probably not but who cares contra is an outsanding restaurant on its own and the chefs here have done an excellent job incorporating their past experiences to create a menu that is both exciting and delicious im not a big fan of charging extra for bread but if you just factor the into the total cost the overall meal is well worth or just a tiny bit more if you add on a supplement which i did the goats head is delicious by the way the brain is akin to bone marrow if youre into that savorysucculent kind of thing dont be so afraid i cant wait to come backyes the eyeball does taste quite gelatinous but i heard it improves your own eyesight as much as pounds of carrots does so feel free to forego your annual eye examination after eating it the texture is practically the same as tapioca anyways which people pay an outrageous extra cents for at all those boba shops here its already included with the marrowesque brain bogo
this place definitely brings the hipster crowd to harlem if you are looking for a cool down to earth bar this is the placeno hassle at the door long lines its drama free i totally dig itthey have a wide selection of beers so there should be something here for everyone i had the pumpkin spice ale which was so yummy i did not eat but my friends who did said the food was great and worth the added calories not to mention my tab for beers was you cant beat that
summary this is as fine a speakeasy as youll find in nyc compared to places like raines or angels share little branch is more pared down less plush less pretty less designy but it knows what its doing it gets at the same sweet spot as the other places it just does it by different means perfect for dates and also for everything elsedetails came on a monday at was nearly empty but filled up nicely over the next few hours by or they started up with the live jazz no vocalist just a few instrumentalists providing background music you pleasantly halfrecognize really well done every other reviewer is correct dont even look at the menu just get the bartenders choice the folks here know what theyre doing i had drinks here and sampled my companions drinksso in all and not a dud among them not one thats pretty impressive our drinks were varied toobased on tequila mezcal gin vodka rumand our requests became laxer as time passed by the fifth drink i think i literally just said vodka and the server said sure and a few minutes later hey presto a cocktail appeared customized for me based on what id asked for previously drinks are each which is a lot until you consider how other places of this sort charge and sometimes more to boot the staff seemed pleasantly surprised that we were staying for more than a drink or two maybe most people just pop in here to see what the fuss is all about then skedaddle so they bought us a round we got eleven drinks but paid for nine just remember cash only
after my first visit to ootoya in union square i was a fan fish fish and more fish yeah i came back with the same dining companions this time and its conveniently located near bryant park my favorite of all nyc parks at a line was already forming anticipation built as approached we were in this time we sat at the bar a unique experience that i prefer over a table of course more than three people and you might want to be able to talk to each other but who needs to talk when your face is buried deep in such delightful dishes theyre known for their mackerel but weve been there done that mini soba is tiny but its one of the best things on the menu why soy sauce gelee i couldnt believe what was happening in my mouth kaisen don its basically chirashi on steroids all i really cared about was the uni and they gave me three huge pieces salmon fatty tuna scallop yellowtail were the other main characters for a set which includes an egg custard and miso soup itll cost you pressed salmon styles of perfectly cut salmon total pieces i would like two orders of that everyday yakitori amazing pricey but tasty you pretty much cant go wrong with anything on the menu
ahhhto be back in spain i visited madrid a few months ago from nyc i cant explain how excited i was when i found out montaditos was opening up right here in my city it is exactly as i remembered it i would frequent this place in madrid at least once a day for a quick lunch first off have you seen their prices their mini sandwiches range from the specialty ones for are def my goto you will more than likely feel overwhelmed with to choose from hence the name please note i recently returned and they no longer have happy hour deals and wednesday specials are very limited to a few items i shouldve deducted a star for inconsistency bc they also removed my favorite montadito off the menu but the place is still awesome and the quality of the meat is excellent
highlander there can be only oneas i trekked through the highlands of scotland by way of nyc weary and parched from our epic journey we saw in the distance a beacon of comfort and safety slowly we walked up to the unassuming front entrance and pushed through the barrier door lo and behold tis be a fine drinking establishment indeedmanly dark wooden accents dim lighting stained glass long bar hidden seating in the back ancient paintings on the walls warm cozy fireplace with cushy leather chairs to sit in and converse over many brews a place that scottish warriors and noblemen alike would be proud to call their own shoolbreds in nyc is the motherland for these fine peoplethe barkeep was a fine gentleman who handed us the menu and was very welcoming we had told him of our journey to this far neatherland and he was more then willing to tell us of the special secret of the day something called happy hour that afforded us a wooden trinket to be handed in for another brew my god what kind of magic was this we were taken in by its spell we chose an ale called rare voss made in some country called ommegang and a potion of hot mulled cider that the barkeep whipped up as his specialty both were exceptional and worthy of a second round which we drank heartily methinks a return trip to this land should be planned to take in a hot toddy or twoyet we needed some food sustenance after a long day perusing the menu there caught my eye a perfect choice french fries with malt vinegar these fine spuds were served to us cooked dark thick and with a fresh potato flavor drenching them in malt vinegar only enhanced the experience more our thirst and hunger were quenchedi also gleaned over a dutiful selection of scotch and whiskeys behind the bar mighty tempting but that be for another timeon this day we had arrived late in the afternoon as it seemed the sun was just over the horizon at about or so night was falling just a few local townsfolk and fellow travelers were inside resting their feet and bellying up to the bar the sounds of music were at a soft level and conversation was easy yes tis a fine establishment indeed laddies and lassies i would recommend this a destination for anyone looking to replentish their souls for a wee bitour minds were now at ease and we made on our merry way to further adventures
stars for nowsince yelp has already broken up the manhattan waterfront greenway nyc greenway path and reviewed the hudson river portion i felt it only fair someone should finally recognize the apparent black sheep of that familysure the paths themselves on the east river side arent as well maintained nor in nearly as good shape be careful biking at nightsure it isnt continuous it wont take you from battery park all the way up the eastern shoreline to inwoodsure its under construction in many places but hey at least its under constructionso yeah i guess that makes it the avenue subway line of bike paths but its a start until they can get the full funding and figure out how to move some united nations offices were stuck with what we got ive seen projections that say most of the greenway could be completed by and others that say it wont be fully completed until closer to until then take advantage of what we havei personally prefer the east river portion of the greenway as you get to see much more of nyc as opposed to nj from the hudson river side i also prefer it because its much less traversed so you can enjoy that scenery without being overly preoccupied looking out for pedestrians bladers runners unattended children and so onyou get a great view of the statue of liberty and verrazanonarrows bridge as you round the bottom of the island and on around passed the staten island ferry where theres a citi bike kiosk there is still ongoing construction to this area due to sandy so keep your eyes pealed for detours from there you can see brooklyn across the river as you ride north passed the south street seaport then you get to ride under the brooklyn manhattan and williamsburg bridges as you continue uptown there are dozens of great spots to pull over and take in the beauty of the city along this path i personally enjoy hanging under the brooklyn bridge on one of the benchesas youre nearing the williamsburg bridge you will be riding adjacent to east river park an oft overlooked gem of the nyc parks department from here if you want to get off the greenway you can take the footbridge over the fdr at delancey stwilliamsburg bridge otherwise you can keep riding uptown where the path narrows into a bottleneck around the con ed plant at st in another blocks youll pass the water club signs say to walk bike no one does from here it isnt too much further until the greenway breaks off at st another citi bike kiosk and you must ride over to the avenue bike lane if you wish to continue uptown at street you can cut back east towards the river until you get to sutton place take sutton north to street where you can once again connect with the east river greenway bikeway then you can continue on the path for another blocks before you once again have to detour back into the cityi know we all want our big apple pie and eat it too but until then lets be happy with what weve got the east river greenway is a wonderful underappreciated pathway for us to enjoy so do just that enjoy
who wants to go again with meread through a few yelpers reviews and some friends comments paul h and stephanie q i wore my contacts comfortable shoes and summer clothes few tips before you go read macbeth so you wont feel lost but you will still love it even though you choose not to read it wear comfortable shoes as mentioned dont drink before the show because you wont have time finish it dont hold hands come on its not scary my friend was caught in front and at first we were so afraid to split up i hate haunted house but just some spoiler its not scary no one will jump out and scares you split up within the group thats what we did and share your notes get the earliest ticket if its possible so you can explore more if you cannot run for seconds train your running skills before you go i am serious i was behind someone who can barely run down the stairs and a few girls behind and i were so mad because we lost the character try not to bring your bag if you have pocket just bring your phone and your credit cardcash its dollars per item to check in your coat or bags i guess you have no choice during the winter wear summer clothes it can be very hot lastly enjoy dont be afraid its not a haunted housei guess one time is not enough there are so many characters to follow i really wanna go again if anyone wants to go with me
nyc needs more places like this no cover usually no hassle at the door providing youre not intoxicated and not a douche although the crowd can be a little older here and somewhat aggressive dont let that deter you because its still a really great spot to come drink and dance ill admit its weird that a few times someone tried to grab my hand but im gonna let it slide lolthe music here is pretty decent although it is about the same every weekend you can definitely expect to hear certain songs if youre here regularly enough ps is chill and if youre hungry the nachos are amazing and they come in huge portions at the bar the bartenders are pretty easy to flag down and theyre so nice theyre also not cheap with the liquor so you dont feel like your wallet got ripped off when you come here just beware of the creepers because there is no real dance floor overall every time ive come here its been a fun laid back night full of drinking and dancing with friends
i dont think i have ever felt more welcomed in a store in my life the two women that were there the afternoon i came in were friendly offered help and had such genuine positive energy i think thats important in any business but especially in one that can be in an uncomfortable environment for many they have cheap lingerie here in pretty much any style your dirty mind can imagine as others have said not a place to get classy la perlaesqe stuff why waste money on something you wont be wearing long anyway they also have a selection of various sex toys vibrating shower loofah anyone as well as bachelorette party gifts they have a picture of the female anatomy up on the wall which is also awesome of them i purchased a sexy number and before i left the older woman in the front called me over to hand me two hersheys kisses what a happy place

if there were to be a french fry heaven on earth this is it forget the calories its all right to indulge in some guilty pleasures once in awhile for one poutine may be one of them until only recently did i discover the poutine at pommes frites and damn that is one unhealthy but freaking delicious snack pommes fries is the manhattan institution of belgian style fries perfectly double cooked belgian style fries which can be accompanied by several different flavored dips you can order them regular large or double ranging from about relatively inexpensive id say get the combo sauce deal for to try sauces or per dip they have your basic condiments plus a variety of mayo based flavored dips youre going to want to try more than one dip though and youll want to try something more than just ordinary ketchup first time i tried the smoked eggplant horseradish and dill lemon mayo no surprise horseradish was my favorite midway torwards the end though you may not be able to differentiate between the dips because trust me youll be nomming away on those fries french fry grease all over fingers and mouth and such the fries alone arent too salty if at all you can really taste the quality of their potatoes and its not just grease and salt their potatoes are not the type you just buy from shop rite either going back on poutine and i capitalize it because i must emphasize it let me emphasize that its super unhealthy but its one of those unhealthy pleasures that you must indulge in at least once in your life or at least the first or second time youre at pommes especially for someone whos never had poutine in their life prepare to have your mind blown i never had it before and the first time i had it at pommes i understood why everyone loves pommes yes its that good cheesy cheese curd melted atop warm gravy warm gravy and cheesy cheese curd melted atop belgian style fries yes there is a french fry heaven on earth and pommes is it nothing to be surprised about but its always busy up in this place ive been lucky enough to get a seat the past few times because most customers will give up waiting for one the moment they walk in pommes is a very very tiny place and its certainly not about ambiance im not really surprised why pommes keeps their shop so small though and i think its a pretty smart business move on their part a true hole in the wall joint and if youre okay with the shabby appearance and lack of seating but at least they got music in the background then call this the perfect place to eat at any time of the day but for myself its perfect for a late night snack sober or not
wow economy candy is a dangerous place for a person like me i enjoy every type of candy and they have an amazing selection and prices i have heard about this place for a while but never got the chance to pop in until recently the store is virtually packed floortoceiling with lots of candy including the more common gummies and other bythepound stuff but also some impressive imported things that i didnt think i could find in new york i spotted about ten types of scandinavian licorice including salt licorice which i love and is an acquired taste for sure turkish delight a variety of french and italian chocolates and the largest variety of german ritter sport bars i have seen in any store including places in europe my head was spinning and not from the sugar rush the prices are literally unbeatable per pound for haribo gummies is a steal when they are usually that here in nyc and its just a dizzying fun place to check out also just a great place to find some unique sweets to give as presents ill recommend this to friends and hope to be a frequent visitor myself
this is my favorite church in the city i walk a mile to go to this church every sunday at i love it because they have a huge gathering at this time and the service is wonderful inside is also gorgeous and big the music is great though traditional the sermon is always applicable towards real life and everyone who goes here is just oh so darn nice ive made a couple of friends through this church since i went to the apostlist young adult group events the mass is the young adult mass so its very inspiring to see people my age take the time to go here in the evening this church is also more on the liberal side so they have a glbt group and they try to address any controversy happening in the catholic community they are very accepting of all people including those who arent catholic oh and one of the priests sang during his sermon that sold it for me

i went to abc cocina for dinner last saturday and had one of the most unreal dining experiences every single thing we had from our first drink to our last taco was delicious imaginative and perfect in every way the ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful the interior is adorned with exposed brick walls and unique hanging sparkling lights that are evocative of an underwater scene our waiter was a super sweet and funny guy who was very attentive the dirty martini was the best one ive ever tasted i know i may have said this before but i really mean it this time it really met all of the criteria on my dirty martini mental checklist glass size ounces degree of dirtiness temperature my sis and i took one sip and looked at each other and exclaimed that they were perfect the food was incredible we had the following all of which are musttrys in my booksweet pea guacamoleshrimp with sizzling garlic and chili oilsweat pea empanadas with chili yogurt chipotle chicken tacossavory glazed short rub tacosmaitake mushrooms with goat cheese we were too full for dessert but id be surprised if those arent amazing as well theres always next time

okay yelp world i may have found it my new favorite thai spot in the city so my girl nomi is headed off on an interesting project overseas today and we needed a proper sendoff diner last night we wanted something both low key and festive at the same time yes you can have both this does make sense trust me the texts started with her i think i want thai maybe ramen mexican could be good too well no not ramenme i need a glass of vino pronto priorities ya knowher yes sameme wine bar her well im not craving wine bar food mex or thaime i cant drink tequila or mezcal that will only lead to trouble and a serious thursday morning hangover with some bacon at my desk thai enter ngam wine bar atmosphere amazing thai food and approximately blocks from where i was standing when said text convo commenced ngam offers both traditional and modern thai options bottles of wine can be purchased for under i am a fan and the atmosphere is both welcoming and sophisticated chef hong has also worked in kittichai jgs spice market and jgs perry street the name itself means beautiful and ngam encompasses just that in every aspect perhaps the best part about this place its locally sourced and seasonal following all the yelp reviews we started with the chiang mai fries composed of pumpkin and sweat potato and served with both a red curry mayo and a sweet and sour peanut relish they were crispy and delicious however things only went up from there next we tried the por pia shitake mushroom spring rolls wow these were amazeballs and the mushrooms were so unbelievably fresh then came the real star of the evening and a surprising one at that authentic old school pad thai yes the pad thai now i know youre reading this thinking really pad thai of all the things you could have ordered lissa i can get pad thai anywhere im here to tell you this aint just anywhere my friends this is the home of the most mouth watering food orgasmic pad thai ive ever tasted yep i said it done and done even before i could finish my first bite i literally moaned out loud ohhhhh myyyyyy gooooodddddd it was just that good its got the traditional pad thai vibe going that we all know and love but this wonderful charred flavor from ngams open kitchen its so good in fact that we finished every last bite and at one point i think i heard my girl say that perhaps we needed another order they also do a zucchini and a papaya pad thai which i would be curious to try but would order in addition to the authentic we also tried the kale fried rice but that didnt blow me away so yea in summary i am a fan i will be back im already craving ngam again less than hours later
having recently moved into the city my goal is to have one allstar restaurant for every different cuisine yelpers as soon as my collection is extensive ill turn it into a list ive already got my israeli and mexican places this may as well be my spanish gotocasa pomona offers an amazing selection of authentic spanish tapas with a handful of innovative additions the decor is beautiful very emblematic of restaurants in madrid this is the places to go tapear verb try different arrays of tapas to obtain a diverse culinary experience and to shun the individuals who suggests everyone order their own main course i came across this place through blackboard eats a site that emails out new restaurants offering discounts i took advantage of the off deal to try out casa pomona as for the individual tapas heres what i thought patatas bravas best fried potatoes ive ever had crispy perfection topped with a sublime tomatopaprika sauce cochinillo pork skin wasnt entirely crispy but it was juicy and flavorful cheese sampling let the chef decide for you he knows best albondigas mama mia what an amazing meatball only two downsides the sangria was nothing to write home about and the service was slow took a while to pay for the check servers werent super friendly however we had a large pitcher of water steady access to water is important for me while eating out so they were pretty minor issues

in all my years of eating ice cream and racking my brain around the who has the best ice cream debate im finally willing to admit my and many others mistake for stubbornly getting lost hating on certain stores and all flavors they serve just because we didnt like the two that we had that dayfor instance sundaes cones is one of those risktaking parlors sure they have the classic chocolate and vanilla which are pretty solid but if you have never tasted or do not like wasabi ginger or black sesame in their actual forms you probably wont be happy with those particular ice cream flavors that your asian friend recommended because heshe was trying to be exotic and demonstrate asianpride the fact that they can draw out those particular flavors into their ice cream is definitely impressive to me but i personally think those three flavors are absolutely disgusting well the black sesame is ooooookay but its still way too strong in my opinion so why stars because they have three flavors which for my particular palate are three of the most amazing scoops of ice cream ive had one of which i would venture to say is the best scoop ive had in new york pistachioalmond most would say if you want a good scoop of pistachio youre better off going for some gelato which i would completely agree with however for ice cream this is really damn good bring in a scoop of pistachio gelato and have a scoop of their pistachioalmond and youll taste the difference it might not be as rich as gelato but the almonds definitely add a layer of flavor that is unique and works really well with the pistachiotaro for starters the best scoop of taro that ive personally had is at chinatown ice cream factory cicf but sundaes cones comes out in a close second and really it all comes down to preference the taro at sundaes cones doesnt have the grainy texture but instead is more smooth and easier for people who may be trying it for the first time granted i think some of the flavor is lost relative to cicf but when it comes down to it there is still plenty of taro flavor and for many people ive taken theyve been immensely satisfied having never had taro hazelnut one word fragrant if you want to experience what i think is the best scoop of ice cream ive had so far in ny go get some hazelnut from sundaes cones and judge for yourself its fucking deliciousoh yeah the prices arent too bad either
youd think that after studying and passing the new york bar exam id be sick to my stomach at the idea of sitting in another coffee shop ahh but youd be wrong turns out my comfort zone is the coffee shop pleasant people watching delicious cup o brew typically great music and an escape into my thoughts and ideas yes coffee shops are places where i can zone out and read and write to my hearts contentit was a great surprise to find birch just one subway stop away from my apartment i had known of the flat iron location for quite some time but just never made it there and while i had every intention of making lenox coffee my goto neighborhood coffee shop im a tiny little gal and tiny little gals probs shouldnt go too far uptown into harlem alone at night yo im just being real can never be too careful hence my venture to street one sunday eveningi didnt really know what to expect from birch but i definitely have high standards for coffee shops check out my list its espresso not expresso for all my coffee shop adventuresaside from the fact that i walked in and stood at the counter for a solid minutes before i was greeted looks like a baristo was socializing with some guests i was pleasantly surprisedthe space is significantly large but not dangerously cavernous take note bourbon coffee the menu is extensive i noticed a dinner menu and beer but settled for a decaf cafe au lait the baristo was super nice and helpful the music selection was on point and perhaps my favorite part candles yes there are tiny candles at each table shut up i dunno theres just something beautiful about a cute coffee shop candlelit at night great music playing ya see id rather fall in love with someone at a coffee shop or library than at some random bar shrugi didnt use the internet strictly a reading and writing sort of night so i cant attest to how good or bad it isregardless i plan on being a frequent customer here and im hoping i get better service next time i visit not that service was terrible im being picky here but it seems rather rude to ignore a customer for almost minutes especially when the place isnt packed but ill give them the benefit of the doubt
it was like i was on a scavenger hunt for the perfect nawlins sandwich my yelp app map was homing in on its beacon beep beep beep all the way to chinatown with its nondescript storefront first off i didnt know what to choose all the sandwiches sounded great but as i usually do i hadnt eaten all day so i needed something beefy braised short rib spicy horseradish sauce arugula cherry tomatoes on buttered toasted challah bread awwww sookie guy behind the counter asked me if i was from new orleans for a second i thought i was that sandwich almost had me speaking in tongues of course i couldnt leave without trying the chicken biscuit that i took togo with an order of benyays the teeny tiny babies of beignets okay im going to be honest even though itll make me look like a complete pig that chicken biscuit didnt even make it home so good spicy perfectly deep fried chicken breast with crispy slaw groan good food is always accompanied by sex noises the location is out of the way and there isnt much desirable seating oh there are benches aplenty but more decorative than useful but i will make the effort to return the guys behind the counter are just too friendly not to see them again
an unassuming shop right by penn station this is a vegan paradise of deliciousness in fact im somewhat upset that no one has recommended this place to me yet seriously yelp friends where were you on thisthe service was just as good as the food one girl had this entire place under control she brought waters without being asked she handed out smiles and cheerful greetings like it was her job better still like it wasnt her job but like she really meant it all the while handling takeout and seamless orderson to the food i had the small macaroni and cheese and the cowboy hero the hero was soy pepper steak tomatoes pickled cucumbers mixed greens and tapioca cheese smothered in a spicy chipotle sauce i only got through about half of the sandwich before the vegan mac and cheese came out more of a buttery flavor than a cheesy one it had flavorful crumbles that made it absolutely addictive it was way too much food for just me but for that price who caresi just wish that i lived closer im in love with loving hut think theyll deliver to brooklyn
rockwood music hall rocks i really enjoyed coming here and plan on coming backhere are my tips mainly for the free stage there are stages at rockwood one you pay for usually one thats free and one thats a mystery to me you enter on allen street there are new bands every hour that perform in the free section they request drink per set but dont enforce it dont be a jerk drinks are cheap good wine for a pop poured with a heavy hand waitress will come around with a bucket for tipping the artist show your support there are seats along the bar and a couple tables but its really smalla perfect evening would consist of drinks at blue ribbon beer garden dinner at sons of essex music at rockwood then go play arcade games at two bit all within steps of each other youre welcome for figuring out your next date night
have you been to moma welcome to except it doesnt have little plaques on the walls explaining that over artists have collaborated to bring you a barrestaurant with two floors of unique installations that appear to the unknowing eye to be common pieces of reclaimed wood and metal arranged together in uncommon waysdo you see that giant twolevel cage that is visible on both floors yes it looks like its for a gogo dancer its not its eventually going to be a freezersculpture with an iceberg in it that will be carved out of a glacier by hand in greenland and then shipped on a boat to our very own lower east side i dont know how they are going to accomplish this and i dont know when but i do know that its a pretty fing novel idea its a large restaurant perfect for big group brunches with people that like well prepared food and drinks there is a bar on the top floor and another one on the lower level on the top floor in the back you will see a long person table separated from the rest of the restaurant and elevated slightly my best friend a princess with a y chromosome whose sense is chanel decided in seconds that he wanted his birthday dinner to be in that very spot we met some of the door staff and the event planner and the general manager they are all very hospitable they are all very handsome they all genuinely care about and take pride in their restaurant most impressive of all they all want to provide their guests with a satiating barbrunchdining experience you should come here
elsa is pretty much the only reason that youll find me in alphabet city its incredibly out of the way far from the subway station and getting here means you have to traverse east village nonetheless this place is quite an amazing bar with great atmosphere and equally great drinks elsa isnt a large cocktail bar by any means however ive never had trouble getting a table and maneuvering throughout this establishment elsas atmosphere is pretty laid back sure it can get a little noisy at times but its not to an unbearable level like at mcsorleys when you walk in youre greeted with the bar on the right hand side there are bar stools if you want to drink at the bar but for those who want to sit down there are tables galore even on a friday night around midnight the longest ive had to wait for a table was roughly around minutes not too shabby at all the lighting here is dim which give it that slightly intimate feel the noise level does throw it off a little bit but its still a pretty laid place to sit down have a conversation and drink in the process if youre looking to get away from the typical east village crowd then youll catch a break at elsa sure everyones in the and early but you wont be seeing guys throw back shots of jameson or doing irish car bombs drinkwise ive always gone with either the manhattan or old fashioned these drinks are made to precision and thankfully are nice and strong the prices are pretty normal for cocktails and thank god this place takes credit cards in the end if youre looking for a place to grab some nice drinks and actually not have to shout to have a conversation then elsa can be your spot the staff is laid back drinks are good and the prices arent going to break your bank
you walk through the dark alleys of chinatown and you can find anything and this bar is no exception it is nestled in the corner of a dark and grimy alleyway next to a basement mexican restaurant one would pay no heed to anything happening in this area of town but listen closely to the music as it is playing within the darken hollows of the corner you will notice a big brute at the entrance guarding the entrance like a mountain troll guarding its treasure speak the password and entry is given password for oct is fitzgerald step inside he says and the curtains unveil a dimly lit and raucous bar filled with people enjoying their drinks and comfortably sitting on the velvet sofas i was pretty much at awe at first sight bartenders in lab coats mixing drinks now that is awesomethe drinks were very stiff but also very tasty weak drinkers can ask the mixologist for a custom drink that wont be as stiff but for the initiated go for any of the drinks that contain absinthe the bohemian fizz is one such drink and this is one of my favorite drinks its nice and stiff gives you a quick buzz right away be careful though too many and you might be floored by the end of the night but this is where the magic begins one sip and you know you are in one hell of a night trust me bring a date as well you might even get lucky this place can do it for youhave fun and be safe
wow this place is a godsend to me ive been here twice with guests visiting nyc and walking all over town in this humid heat so foot massages were much much needed after doing a little research on my trusty yelp app i narrowed it down to just a few places i dont honestly know if ill make it to the other spots bc yan mei hit the spot really wellfirst off the service is pretty good the host guy is very kind and accommodating and the masseuse though not all of them can speak english really well are also kind and try their best to make it comfortable for you this place is clean hygienic and has a pleasant smell i have walked in and called in advance and either times i did not have to wait very long that or i would just take a walk and come back they will take your phone number and call youwhat yan mei is not though is totally quiet and tranquil it can be a bit noisy white noise theres outside traffic for one but also idle chatter amongst people in the back rooms and the lobby and occasionally a masseuse will let their timer beep off for minutes on end if youre really paying attention youll hear other guests grunting and bodies being pushed up against and hands on clothing with pressure etc now normally all of this couldwouldshould bother me but the massage is so good that its not hard for me to zone out and drown out that white noise while they do manage to keep it quiet and relaxing most of the time the slightly buzzing ambience might not be for the sensitive types a warning for light sleepers etcdespite the white noise the massages are great because they are efficient in pinpointing what areas of your back neck shoulders and feet that really need help they use an adamant amount of pressure and you will feel the pain depending on how messed up your muscles are especially if youre like me and sit at a computer all day but its worth it to me to get these knots ironed out and they do it in a way that its not excruciating for too long after a while they get them out afterwards i always feel refreshed relaxed and muscles looser which is a great feelinglike others say this is a nofrills place and its cash only i believe its a clean place for chinatown small and simple sometimes the masseuse will use paper towels to massage your neckback but my guy was so graceful doing it the first time that i didnt even noticecaremind if you decide to go with the a option which is a whole hour for which i recommend they start off by having you soak your feet in hot water while your back is facing them and they start with your neck back and shoulders after minutes they turn you around and seat you in the chair where they spend minutes on your feet min on each foot for the price this is simply a great dealthe only thing i regret is not tipping my guy more all i had left was exactly in tips but i felt he deserved way more than that he took his time even though he was the last guy left and the place was beyond closing ill be back again soon though
raffettos is one of the few remaining smalltime institutions that make nyc so great we have bought sauces homemade pastasincluding all kinds of varieties of ravioli and turkey meatballs to make wonderful wonderful dishes with at home cash only but everything is pretty cheap this place has been here approximately years but you might never notice it if you are not looking i had lived down the street for years before a client of mine who had frequented raffettos years ago brought it to my attention so glad she did
new york city has failed to wow me in the service department but my experience last night at club a was worthy of a next morning yelp walked in without a reservation and were seated upstairs after telling the hostess that it was our first time there we had an end table near the wall of windows and the beautifully lit tree outside when we arrived the place was nearly empty and when we left it was full glad we got there when we did our service was great because of it my friend and i split a nice bottle of wine and it was decanted in the craziest decanter ive seen we decided to split the oz filet which was more than enough meat for both of us the steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly we also shared three sides creamy mashed potatoes with garlic brussel sprouts with parmesean and mixed mushrooms the sides all complimented the steak beautifully they gave us a complimentary mushroom ravioli appetizer which was a nice touch they truly went above and beyond by bringing us a complimentary dessert plate the owner was very sweet and stopped by to check on us more than a couple times it was very unexpected but appreciated i would defnitely recommend this place to all my friends and coworkers
i just moved in around the corner and i finally made it in today to come do some work the space is really cute and inviting and they have two communal tables to sit at they have a wide ranges of drinks housemade baked goods and sandwiches i went with an iced coffee and a half cuban sandwich the iced coffee was good and the girl next to me had a glorious looking latte the sandwich was really delicious too and only for a half they also have water out for people to grab which i think is niceits nice to have a lowkey neighborhood joint just outside the tourist havens of columbus circle and times square hopefully the tourists dont find itthe couple sitting next to me is super weird though they keep oneupping each other with bizarre stories meningitis a katrinadestroyed home a tornado a robbery an almost marriage to a terrible person and chronic illness ok shut up all of those things cant possibly have happened
i dont think you need to be a high calorie burning athlete to enjoy these amazing cookies but it could definitely help with the calorie intake my absolute favorite cookie here is chocolate chip walnut semisweet chocolate chips and chunks of walnuts huge thick and gooey but crisp on the outside the new york times says these may possibly be the largest most divine chocolate chip cookies in manhattan and i would completely agree with that statement i have yet to find a cookie as perfect as theirs this shop is out of the way since i live in les but i find myself making excuses to travel into this area specifically to have one of their chocolate chip walnuts to stay and taking a few to go they last for a few days and still taste terrific with a little bit of heat zap so i have no problem grabbing some to go i just know that after my cookie binge i should really consider doing a set of long runs

ladies hes good yes i feel a tad squeamish reviewing my obgyn but we all have biznass to take care of and a good quality doctor can be hard to find in these parts i discovered dr jovanovic on the web i wasnt originally looking for a new gynecologist but the lengthy waits to book at my previous doctor gave me the impetus to look for somebody more convenient and flexible i was able to quickly secure an appointment the following week on zocdoc and the site made it possible to fill out medical questionnaires in advance boom boom boom there were two things dr jovonovic did that impressed me he apologized for being late and took the time to introduce himself i like his bedside manner hes patient personable thorough and explains everything i felt like i was in good hands the office is clean and comfortable and i did not find the receptionists to be brusque or rude so while im lucky enough to only visit him annually im thankful that its a pleasant experienceother things to knowbook ahead on zocdoc this allows you to see availability the office is on the far side of street towards the park budget enough time for transportation they take credit cards
for on a friday night at midnight we had no problem getting in even though the hostess was a tad hesitating the entrance for top of the standard is different than for le bain i knew it was going to be hard to get into le bain especially at the time that we arrived so i opted for something more relaxing the line for le bain was crazy long so i was glad we got inthe view of the top of the standard was gorgeous you get to see jersey and nyc all at once around the venue the venus itself is gorgeous and classy as hell i havent been to a swanky place like this for awhile so it was nice to see what new york had to offer again it wasnt that crowded that friday night but there was music and a few people dancing around beautiful and dressy people you can expect to see here the drinks yes go up to but i already expected this top of the standard shares the same city view bathrooms but they do give you a stamp to differentiate where you can go in or not since le bain folks are probably too crazy for the folks at the top of the standard my suggestion go to the top of the standard and get a stamp you get the choice to go to venues at once rather than just one le bain we went to the bathroom and just easily walked towards the other door to le bain with no problems at all skipped the line with ease
honestly honestly probably the best view from a roof top bar in nyc for serious i work on the floor in midtown so i am pretty spoiled with sweet views every day i also have been to probably other roof top venues around the city so i feel qualified and correct in saying that this is one of the best views possible the view seriously the view you can see a great cityscape on one side and a completely unobstructed view of water on the other depending on your mood you can sit on one side of the bar and see only buildings or you can sit on one side and see waterjersey options people optionswe came with a group of on a saturday evening around est it was not crowded when we left to get dinner around est it was crowded but not absurdly crowded this place was laid back and not pretentious which i dig we got couch seats and a table by the water our waitress was efficient drinks are but that is a given i want to poetically describe how nice it is to relax with a cold drink good friends amazing views and perfect weather on a clear saturday night but i do not want to sound cheesyps i took my camera here to take photos of the sunset just for kicks i am not into instagram but i can imagine a person who likes to instagram would have a blast here
im pretty fantastic at tracing cutting paper coloring and writing the alphabet by hand im not at all fantastic at drawing or painting while i wont go so far as to say that im suddenly fantastic at painting after taking a class at paint along i will say im much more confident and find painting to be really fun nowa class is usually an hour and a half long and costs but if you check the website on the day of a class and they still have openings available you will only have to pay you can sign up on their events calendar and choose which painting youd like to paint the price includes paints a canvas brushes a wash cup and an apron well youll only be able to take home the canvas but its still a good dealeach class is byob i usually become red and sleepy after consuming alcohol so i stayed far away from the bottles of wine being passed around because i wanted to create as good of a painting as i could my classmates who did drink seemed to have a grand time though paint along provides plastic cups and bottle openersthe instructor broke down steps in an easytounderstand manner she gave very good tips on spacing and shapemaking showed us how to mix paints accurately painted an example painting for us and made it clear that we could customize our paintings to our liking she was very patient and a good multitasker especially because she had to juggle teaching us refilling paints and helping those who needed a lending hand guilty as charged as kristen d mentioned it may be nice to have an assistant who could help with these tasks especially when a class is at full capacity this is an exciting unique idea for a great date night some time alone or with a group of friends when we all observed our classmates paintings at the end of class we were amazed to see how there were little touches of personality here and there in brushstrokes and color choices likelihood of another visitvery likely ill be keeping my eye on their events calendar i kind of sort of probably want to have my birthday party here

the best car service in the city flat rate tofrom jfk tofrom lga via east villagehow i came to find quick ride was a little like the story of goldilocks the three bears i tried other methods of transportation to and from the airports around nyc from uber to carmel super shuttle and some other rando car services i cant even namei was never satisfied either the rates were too high the time it took to get me places took too long they were late with pickups or the automobile i was in reeked of cigarettes bo all true stories by the waythen i found quick ride through this trusty website and havent looked back sincefor starters i dont care that they dont have a website they dont need one because whatever theyre doing works if you hate talking to people on the phone theres really nothing to worry about whoever is on the other line at quick ride is literally quick at taking down your pickup or drop off info and locking it in the system i always get picked up on time or even earlier for that matter and have never been late to the airport coming from my apartment in the east village which takes about hour at most theyve also been consistent with airport pickups and if anything are just minutes behind schedule which i dont mindfriendly drivers who respect your privacy and never talk too much always a plus in my book
when you come here i think there are a couple things that you have to take for granted youre going to spend a lot of money and there is no way youre going to spend an amount that feels a bit high at least that was my reaction once we got seated in zzs which has a very speakeasy feel to it you have seats at tables and another seats along the wall and thats it im pretty sure a reservation is required regardless of how many people are inside just given the fact that you have a guy wearing a suit standing in front of the door with what i presume is a list of names and spots available so dont plan on wandering through greenwich village to end up here the service is quick and pretty simple there are a couple of waiters who bring your dishes as they are prepared you have music playing at a decent volume in the background though so this doesnt come off as a true speakeasy there were times when i felt the volume the or so of us were generating is more than would be tolerated at a place that really keeps an ear out for the volumezzs although it calls itself a clam bar is really more generally focused on seafood only a few of the menu items are clams or clambased it also focuses on the cocktails all of which at least according to the waitress are original concoctions the vast majority are based on fruit flavors and the two that we had mango and strawberry were delicious in particular the mango flavor blended seamlessly with the bourbon to create a drink with a little bite but not overwhelmingly so and the giant ice cube that sits in the middle helps to temper the drink as it melts the strawberry is also really good with the light flavor of the berry providing a gentle overtone to whatever alcohol was used as the base i forget what it was with an herbed finishthe real star though has to be the food i think its pretty easy to blanche on first glance at the menu every single menu item is over with some running as high as very expensive considering that everything here is pretty much an appetizerstyle dish not an entree if you want to stick with oysters and clams those are pretty standard price a pop or so on average before we ordered we were served an amuse bouche of clam flatbread which was just so damn phenomenal we asked the waitress if there was any way we could order it its not on the menu and the answer was no apparently everyone asks i usually like my flatbreads relatively plain but the clam had an interesting smoky flavor and the amount of cheese was just right creating a bite that makes you wonder how you can get more of the other dishes we ordered i would absolutely recommend two the ones we had the tuna carpaccio and the cherry trout crudo id love to try the other carpaccio some time that one comes with beef and caviar but the tuna is breathtakingly delicious you have a circle of fresh tuna thats been pounded into thin slices covered in foie gras and bone marrow and topped off some chives it is so good the double whammy of fatty goodness that the foie and marrow provide brings out the richness of the tuna flavor plop it on a piece of toasted brioche toast that comes with it and you have a dish that will make you nearly forget about the rest of the meal the cherry trout is served up with trout roe and fried leeks the trout itself is absolutely delicious very good flavor but the roe helps provide dashes of saltiness that helps enhance the dish the leeks also add additional texture and a dash of greasiness that works really well the golden eye snapper is not as succulent but the firmness of the fish is a nice change of texture and it pairs really well with the strawberry i think garnish on top the uni toast is decadent as anything with uni should be i liked the pretzel bread that was used gives it a bit of an ny feel to the dish the seared scallop was really good as well the scallops is sliced up thinly in the shell but compared to the other dishes it doesnt quite stand out as much the oysters we got of everything were very good all are east coast so dont expect anything too sweet but the oysters from freshwater rivers were very interesting a much more neutral taste than those that came from elsewhere we finished the meal with key lime pie a bit overpriced at but immaculately prepared with a firm crust on bottom a key lime filling that bites with pinches of sweet tartness and what looks like a slightly baked meringue on top its a classy and delicious way of finishing off a phenomenal mealyes this place is expensive so dont come here if you dont want to overspend a little but the originality of the place the decor and the high quality of the dishes served makes this a place not to be missed its not anything like an upstate where the focus is on the mollusks but its a spectacular experience in its own right

this place is amazing think texas bbq meets a burrito maybe i just ordered the exact right thing ive been know to do that got a burrito w half brisket half antelope smoked antelope was their special of the week both were awesome with a nice smoked flavor the antelope reigned supreme i think the other stuff like jalape√±os and tomato baste it was sitting in added so much flavor there does end up being a lot going in with the burrito once u soup it up but thats your choice id recommend the guacamole corn and perhaps squash addon for a dollar plus some cheese cost me but i got way more meat than at a chipotle and it tasted way better and something uniquea few operational suggestions for management your water dispenser is very slow perhaps this is deliberate to steer patrons towards soda etc if so thats genius the wrapper on burrito is put on inside out i believe the foil should be on the outside and the paper should be on the inside and now you owe me a free burrito
we wanted our first day as a married couple to be special so instead of flying to tokyo for sushi we made a reservation at sushi nakazawa the reservation system is a bit elusive with only bar seats more likely than not you will be sitting at a table out of sight of the famed jiro ono apprentice we got lucky though and got to sit right in front the atmosphere is inviting there was classical music playing in the background albeit a little loud modern decor with a granite counter top even the swivel bar stools had leather arms and a back the spacing between diners was great hands down the most comfortable sushi bar experience ive ever hadnakazawasan is in a league of his own he has this magnetic personality that you would not expect from a high end sushi chef most nyc sushi chefs are grumpy i dont mind since i respect their craft and their food but nakazawasans laugh is intoxicating and he has a really good sense of humor his english is also surprisingly good im not sure if its a result of his time spent in seattle but we were able to have a coherent conversation and you could tell he was enjoying the interaction and not annoyed by it love itthere is no menu its omakase all the way there is a long drink menu but i recommend just going with the sake pairing you get glasses of sake with i lost count because i ended up ordering or pieces on top pieces of nigiri and a toro handroll for before taxtip each additional piece of nigiri cost about expected so no sticker shock here the sushi is great ive written so much about the experience its hard not to write about the sushi i started out with two pieces of alaskan wild salmon one smoked one not smoked i was expecting these a little further down the line with the usual white fish first but it made no difference youll notice that he chooses quite a few northwest fish for his lineup wa geoduck alaskan king salmon etc then came the chard mackarel hamachi etc etc etc the pieces that really stand out are the smoked and pickled pieces its all technique here fellas the flavors and textures are complex so youll end up sitting there trying to compare it to something youve had before i couldnt put my finger on some of them and i just love that feeling of experiencing something new the scallop is such a crowd pleaser a little sea salt on top some citrus and a little poof in your face jalapeno burn with the delicate crunch of fresh scallop yum yum the toro uni is what you expect ridiculously good although he does not crack the uni open from the shell anymore the meal was perfect i even bumped into alex the owner on our way out he was personable and took a picture for us outside the restaurant if you can swing it i highly recommend you give nakazawa a try
i know i am not supposed to do this antiyelp policy butit is like a torrid love affair that you are carrying on and it is explosive and mindblowing you want to tell everyone about it but you cant the wife will be heartbroken the husband devastated this is what i feel when i think about this place a neighborly place where everybody knows each other which is cool since we live in a city of million strangers excellent fish tacos and pretty kickass nachos they have draft beers which include ufo and harpoons ipa do not miss the spicy watermelon margaritas overall a great night with great friends and awesome jane fonda as barbarella onscreen couldnt have asked for a better saturday night
this place is one of the best soup dumplings in the city basically they serve soup dumplings dumplings with soupy broth and a meatball inside upon initial bite the soup oozes out of the dumpling and the flavors explode in your mouth the meatball inside is soft and the dumplings outer layer is soft as well the whole dumplings consist of higher quality ingredients its competitor more popular is joes shanghai joes is very good as well and vastly famous for their soup dumplings but im confident to say shanghai caf√© has better soup dumplings they dumplings are more flavorful the dumplings were so kind i felt so loved they were good to me
fun im so glad i did this thanks to yelps bucket list sort of a surreal experience flying through the middle of the air through manhattan towards the bridge and then over the river definitely offers a different view of the city and its definitely a mustdologistics not too crowded in the early afternoon on a summer monday we got on for free xfers from taking the subway which i was pleasantly surprised about no ac to speak of but once we were moving the breeze came through and it wasnt too bad when you get off the tram on roosevelt island youll see an adorable little building surrounded by plants flowers go to here immediately inside there will be a lady who is so friendly kind that she will restore your faith in humanity you can buy souvenirs water postcards and get a map of the island also when you put your phone down to dig your wallet out of your bag subsequently leave it there she will notice she will hold onto it for you she will call your dad explain that his daughter left her phone at the visitors center on roosevelt island like a moronwhen you sheepishly come back for your phone she will say i called your dad i hope thats okay and she will have made your trip to roosevelt island completely worthwhile and even make you want to return someday
the best lobster roll anywhere gets you a delicious lobster roll with mayo you can request without with no trouble on a buttery toasted potato bun a bag of kettlecooked chips and some of the best soda i have ever had thats saying a lot because i do not drink soda carbonation bugs my nose id recommend the blueberry soda out of times i am here my boyfriend and i get a third roll to split because it is so darn delicious this is also probably the only restaurant we dont really speak at while eating because were relishing in the deliciousness of our food so much i wish i was joking if you dont want chips and the soda the roll itself will cost you they also offer shrimp rolls crab rolls grilled cheese and they have great soup tip the ceramic lobster claws on the tables are filled with old bay seasoning i believe thats what it is called if you dont see any claws ask the guy behind the counter for it it will take your roll from outstanding to canttalksodelicious

piora is the brain child of chef chris cipollone and restaurateur simon kim formerly of the tenpenny and the mark respectively since its opening just days ago it has already stirred up quite a buzz in town im shocked that no one on yelp has reviewed piora yetpiora is korean for blossom as evidenced by the gorgeous flower mural on the wall by stephanie goto of aldea and corton when i mentioned how gorgeous the space was our server immediately began to gush about ms goto you trained them well piora love it also most of the food served is italian with french and korean influences interestinggreeted by the cheerful hostess we were led past the foyer bar area to an intermediate space with only three stoolseating tables the glass panels enclosing the space provided a more private intimate environment compared to the open main dining area in the back theres also a lush outdoor garden patio that our server joe assured us will be opened soontheir menu is divided into six sections in the hopes that youll order a dish from each between the two of us we only ordered four dishes not including dessert to share so for the average two persons five to six plates should be reasonablethe amuse bouche of watermelon with mint and pistachio was the first to the table it was very simple and there was no cohesion between the ingredients but the watermelon was perfectly ripe and crispy and the mint was freshthe six pieces of monkey bread sat snugly in a scalding black rectangular skillet each piece fit comfortably in the palm of your hand the bread was not the least bit gooey or overly sweet it was light and fluffy with a hint of butter topped with a thin layer of salt the bread also came with seaweed butter and whipped lardo presented on unwieldy marble coasters by itself or slathered on the bread they were both incredibly deliciousthe scallops with sweet corn chanterelle and crispy chicken skin was a creative fancy twist to southern comfort food the scallops two pieces were cooked just right with an even charred layer i was delighted that they used my favorite part of chicken crispy skin to counterbalance the soft corn kernels and creamy corn pureei have no words for the rigatoni with red wine duck sausage spigarello and charred fig except that you must get it each bite contained bursts of flavor from the fragrant fennel in the duck sausage reminiscent of star anise in taiwanese braised pork on rice or lu rou fan the fullbodied red wine and sweet fig the complexity of this dish was outstandingin the ocean trout with cauliflower pear and nduja dish chef cipollone let the perfectly cooked ocean trout speak for itself it was moist and flakey where the sweetness of the pear quietly enhanced the flavor of the trout but it was the plating of the dish that impressed me if you look carefully it appears to be an aerial view of the bottom of a lake with a large rock drifting seaweed and small pebbles absolutely stunningwhile service was a bit shaky as the servers and bus boys were still grasping the ropes joe was lovely though they will surely learn quickly as mr kim was personally checking in on each table the night we were there the prices are on the higher end but the food is absolutely worth it it is such a rarity these days to find a restaurant in which every dish is thoughtout carefully and executed flawlessly piora will be the next big restaurant and cipollonekim is definitely a team you want to follownotes we sadly had to skip dessert but they have a peach shaved ice and strawberry shortcake with yuzu i definitely want to try the entire menu is posted on their website the barbecued octopus in gochujang with basil pine nuts and red pepper flakes also sounded amazing next time for sure
so this was my first time back in about four years i had one dinner here that i found oddly lacking for all of the hype that was swirling about fast forward and i find myself with a group of friends who all rabidly want to try this place for the first time reluctantly i joined or should i say fortunately i gave it another shotthis time i found the food to be much more focused numerous courses had flavors that were very sharp unlike my prior muddled experience filled with bland or muddled dishes of course they also included some of the classics like the smoked egg and the shaved foie gras its about courses and a pretty reasonable amount of food though you might be a bit hungry afterwards if you are anything like me on the plus side unlike many of the other double digit tasting menus i have tried they keep the dishes movingsince they do two seatings a night we were in an out in exactly two hours this might be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you want to get out of a tasting menu at this price pointthe staff was super friendly and accommodating i definitely plan on coming back much more frequently than my prior four year hiatusps the highlight of the night had to be the girl walking in and asking for a takeout menu when she was told it was strictly a reservationonly tasting menu kind of restaurant she insisted that she would be fine with just taking out a few of the courses fortunately we were seated near the door and heard this whole exchange so much laughter ensued
i almost dont want to write a review for shigure because i want to keep it a hidden gem forever but a place like this really deserves some good press one of my friends discovered it recently and brought me others here on a quadruple date since there were so many of us and everything on the menu looked interesting we ordered two of everything ive never tried everything at a restaurant before so i cant say this for any other place but i can definitely declare that everything on shigures menu was delicious my favorites were the washugyu tataki and the duck chashu but really you cant go wrong with any dish they also have an extensive selection of sake and though im not a connoisseur the bottle my friend ordered was very smooth and paired well with our food the space is open with high ceilings and its great for two people or a large group like ours highly recommend
i was ready to try a new saunabath one of my favorite things and juvenex was on the list it is definitely pricier than the russian bathhouse but youre getting a much bigger treatment package for you do their saunas dry steam and soaking tub plus a body scrub hair wash and facial i phoned up a coworker made our appointments and off we wentit took a while to find this place but once youre inside you feel like youve stepped to another world everything is warm and curvy and natural and lovely the girl behind the counter was beyond nice she showed us to the locker room its really just a general changing area with a halfwall and was waiting with robes towels and cucumber water for us after we got in our suitsspeaking of suits i think you can go in the buff during the day womenonly hours but everyone was wearing a suit first up dry sauna this was my favorite not the hottest ive ever been in but way more zen it was like a stone igloo it was dark and had an herbal scent lying on the bench i felt like i was back in the wombnext soaking tub probably my least favorite the water was an ok temperature but i had thought it would be mega hot like the osen tubs ive read about this was like a tepid bath there were lemons floating in the water which was nice on to the steam room i liked this room it was like a little greenhouse without the plants the ceiling was peaked and the whole room was plastic instead of marble very cool vibe the heat was good too like the dry sauna it had an herbal thing going on the scent was nice more noticeable in the wet heat after about minutes in each room two ladies told us it was time for our scrub we were brought into a side room and realized we were going to get scrubbed together same room separate tables so now im naked and hanging out with my naked coworker luckily were buddy buds but if you want to do a spa day with your new motherinlaw you might want to ask for separate roomswe get on our tables nude and giggling im waiting for them to drape a towel over me but it never happened you are fully exposed the whole time then i waited for them to get the body scrub mixtureusually a sugar or salt slurry nope they use mega intense mitts commence scrubbing this was not zen it was militant at one point my knees were over my ears while i was scrubbed in ohsounexpected places most hysterical part we were turned on our sides and i made a point of ensuring we were back to back my logic was this way my coworker wouldnt have me staring at her ass i did not consider that eventually wed both be on our other sides which meant we were now facing each other naked and getting scrubbed and trying not to crack upespecially when our legs were being lifted and stretched while we were on the table we also got our hair wash and facials both were kind of abrupt but appreciatedso i could see someone disliking this experience bcs youre exposed and getting manhandled but really it was so insanely funny and my skin is so incredibly soft now so i have to say it was worth itwe got to relax in the sauna again after our treatment and we were offered complimentary tea and fruit i cant say it enough the service was top notch i would definitely recommend checking out juvenex just be sure to get a good sense of what the treatments entail before you go

having now been open for the greater part of seven years i was worried that the modern would lose its edge after all seeming the more avantgarde of the pair is difficult when the other half of said pair is the moma beyond that highend restaurants have a tendency to wheeze softly into complacency once theyve achieved a sizable cadre of regulars look no further than the recent ny times review of daniel for proof of that finally perhaps most troubling of all was the sheer rate of expansion of the union square hospitality group empire the full divestiture of eleven madison park to daniel humm notwithstanding every great location closing carried with it the buzz that danny meyer was eyeing the space for an opening maintaining michelin star standards at one restaurant while simultaneously pursuing the creation and development of others is no small feat the odds then were stackedupon entering the bauhaus derived room you will want to breathe easier thinking that no space this meticulously functionally intuitively arranged would be dragged down by poorly executed dishes instead you will feel a sharp intake of breath at the sheer height of the ceiling the impossible openness and the panoply of sculptures seemingly visible from every angle it is as if walter gropius were teleported from weimar to construct this utilitarian cathedral in the middle of manhattan then ordered to spruce it up with the tiniest hints of expressionism he so secretly enjoyed the food embraces this same enviable synthesis of form and function in less obvious fashions however the obligatory test tube amuse aside the food also manages to convey emotion through aesthetic insofar as one is capable of following along and insofar as one is open to the idea that the narrator is not telling the same tale to everyone while the decor is sleek obvious and immediate in its minimalist appeal the food can be erudite rewarding those who take the time to savor thereby sussing out tiny flourishes that would be acutely imperceptible to the voracious the modern is not a place to be consumed in one desperate journey instead like any great museum it is a place predicated by and made more immersive through periodic sustained reflection and at times ruminationon first taste the pitted raspberry seems to be an unrefined parlor trick a tart fruit stuffed with something as rich as foie gras is hardly genius given the utter propensity of renditions on offer in restaurants throughout the city the lesser scale here simply a nuance then the juniper coolis reaches your palate any sort of smug selfassurances about the course your meal was sure to take that you formulated mere moments ago fall by the wayside with the first hint of pine that juniper berries imbue you move then to the pralines of foie gras terrine dubious in equal measure at the servers pronunciation prayleen and the fact that the dish comes with a mango pur√©e you will then blithely forget your skepticism and spoon the long carpet of pure√©e from your plate safe in the knowledge that your peers are too engrossed by their own plates to see and judge you accordingly your partner is too busy marveling over the gently roasted royal trumpet mushrooms uncovering each bouchot mussel with the reaction of a prospector finding a solid nugget of gold you will wonder when the chef gabriel kreuther plans on showing his roots your wonder will cease when the alsatian dumplings arrive and it will begin anew at the first taste of sunchoke and truffle melding with the delicate gamey rabbit m regretted ordering the munsterbrie souffl√© in their place though it too was greater than the sum of its parts for the entr√©es to follow such thoughtful and composed appetizers and to not only match but trump them speaks to a sort of culinary perfectionism that most restaurants only ever dream of achieving both the maple brined pork loin and its cracklin and the beef tenderloin and the bone marrow it comes with and their respective interspersion of accompaniments are all prepared so flawlessly that you will be forced to hypothesize why cuisine so irreproachably skillful merits but a sole michelin star you will reach no answers but you will take comfort in knowing that in spite of how well it embodies its name the modern is timeless

i didnt buy into the whole mixology thing until i walked into amor y amargo the second time came here to catch up with another former seattleite on a saturday night that was a bad idea coming here on a saturday night not the catching up part the place is small but not too crowded so we stood by the bar and ended up getting a beer another bad idea came back earlier this week on a weeknight and it was a much more pleasant experience we briefly looked through the menu ordered at the bar and promptly found some empty stools even though the bar was busy i love that it didnt get too loud and the bartender was attentive despite us sitting away from the bar i also love how warm colorful cozy and incredibly intimate this place is wait did i just use the words warm colorful cozy and intimate in a positive light my friends would describe me as being extremely aloof so i generally use these words with slight displease when i pay for a drink id like it to be pretty gosh darn good or i expect it to be pretty potent so far only amor y amargo drinks have lived up exceptionally well to both expectations and their drinks are actually less than i had a couple gin tonic my absolute favorite white negroni and a negroni dealers choice yes yes i had a few drinks on a weeknight dont judge it was a long week as brooklyn b would say all of the drinks i had were amazing and well worth the price i cant wait to come back on another quiet weeknight

if youre willing to go to chinatown and shell out per cocktail youre most likely heading to apotheke however you pronounce the namebecause apotheke is a speakeasy the exterior is unassuming save for a man bouncer sitting outside of the entrance look for an gold flower restaurant the chinese characters dont really match up either it translates into gold flower karaoke these signs were from the prior restaurant that no longer existsas you walk in you pass through a panel of heavy curtains and you find yourself in a darkened room mosaic flooring victorianera sofas and lamps whose bulbs were fashioned out of beakers line the path to the bar the yellow tinted bar at the back provides the main source of lighting for the room it also serves as the focal point of the roomthe bar is beautifully aged its design is reminiscent of a chemical laboratory your bartenders wear white lab coats your drinks are ordered off of a menu titled a selection of house prescriptions and all drinks feature some type of exotic foreign ingredient all drinks range from to you cant order shots like lemon drops here sorry college kidsservice if youre camped out on the couches brace yourself for unbelievably slow service it would be easier for you to grab your drinks at the bar and bring them back to an open tablepeople a mix of professionals relaxing after a long day couples on dates this is not a good first date spot in my opinionmusic awesome and throwbacks on weekends jazzlive band during the weekbathrooms are unisex so guys be kind and put the seat back down also the bathroom sinks are impossible to figure out ive been here several times now and i still dont know how to turn off the faucets

this is precisely what vegetarian eating should be normally when i go to a restaurant i am forced to flip directly to the one small portion of the menu that caters to the vegetarians on large menus there are usually a few items sometimes even a whole section but on smaller ones its sometimes just one one heaven help you if you dont want what they have chosen to serve you vegetarians deal with this dilemma every single time they go out to eati have been a vegetarian since i was pretty little if you gave me a ham and cheese sandwich in kindergarten i would have picked the ham out its not a moral thing the idea of eating animals just creeps me out when i was little my dad would tell servers that i had a disease jokingly of course this also happenedme what would you recommend for a vegetarian at this restaurantserver ummm lettuceso when i walked into this place and was handed a menu of pages and pages of delicious vegetarian options happy doesnt quite cover it im not trying to convert anyone ill eat my dinner you eat yours as far as i know im not contagious but it was nice to not have to worry if there is food for me for once comes down from soapbox the decor of this place is swanky and trendy but not so much that you and a friend cant show up without a reservation and get a table for two we had a prime spot next to a gorgeous fish tank if the whole restaurant is as clean as that tank we are in good shape it was spotless definitely wins the award for cleanest tank ever service was prompt and friendly although she never actually mentioned anything about the restaurant or asked us if we had been here before seems like vigilante meateaters would want a warning about what they are orderingwe ordered some sake which was reasonably priced at just for the large i got the fbeef teriyaki bento box and my cohort got a fchicken stir fry everything was soo good the bento box came with salad edamame veggie potstickers fcalifornia roll and sliced teriyaki beef over vegetables so much food for only i ended up bringing a bunch of it home for tomorrow i ended up asking my nonvgetarian cohort if hers was vegetarian too her response oh i dont know is it victory im quite sure that i will be back here again and again i add fs before anything fauxmeat or fmeat

desperately need a few hours away from the chaos of the concrete jungle want to feel absolutely pampered from head to toe in luxury then you need to take a trip to the setai club spai opted for the tour of asia treatment which includes a lava bath body scrub and shiatsulike massage on a friday afternoon when i booked i was told to bring loose fitting clothing for the massage portion i could arrive minutes early to enjoy the aqua grotto steam room sauna and jacuzzi and could continue to enjoy after my treatment for as long as i wished even though i left my apartment with ample time and gps in hand i still managed to get lost i received a phone call exactly at the time my treatment was to start and they calmly and very nicely gave me directions upon arrival i was ushered to the locker room given a quick tour and my therapist renata was waiting for me at the door with bath already drawn she added oil infused with lemongrass and rice milk to the lava bath and left me with chai tea water and a green tea ice cream mochi to enjoy with my bath ahhhh the little details the body scrub was equally phenomenal as every inch of my bod was scrubbed minus my boobies and hoo ha after i rinsed off my skin felt so moisturized and was as smooth as a babys bottom renata had clothes laid out for the massage another unexpected and very nice touch and continued with the yogalike massage that melted away my aches and pains unlike other spas that offer multiple treatments this room was set up so everything was there the bath the shower to wash off the scrub the massage tableso convenient and added to the ease and flow of everything this totally contributed the unhurried feel from one treatment to the next which resulted in even more relaxation after my treatment i was taken to the relaxation room where i was offered water wine champagne and assorted mini treats which ranged from healthy to bite sized sweets again all the little extras hospitality and attention to detailnow on to the amenitiesfacilities in every locker is a super comfy robe cushy cotton slippers and rubber slippers that actually fit and arent onesizefits all enormous for the aqua grotto every fluffy towel is embroidered with their logo the facility is super clean and since i went on a weekday during the day i had the entire aqua grotto to myself this is hands down the best spa experience ive ever hadand ive been to spas in many different cities countries and of every caliber the staff was so friendly and helpful the treatments were above and beyond expectations which expectations are already high given the hefty price tag and the aqua grotto was top notch ill definitely be back
id go back alone for the white sangria and the sea salt potatoes no seriously id put aside every day for that aloneoh and eh i suppose the rest was okay on my walks up pinehurst to the local grocery store over the past few months ive been slowly watching the transformation of rusty mackerel from the old vines on pine location i was a bit bummed at first presuming itd be a seafood place based on the title as i started to follow their twitter updates i became a bit more excited with their menu offerings upon finding out the opening date i offered to take the beau for a meal out on opening week i was literally giddy at work the day of our dinner plansmy giddiness was not in vainthey worked the small space well tables were a bit tight but nothing that pulling them out a bit cant fix a brightly drawn funky mackerel mural shone brightly over an open kitchen area in the rear theres exposed brick so being a sucker for that i immediately fell in love with the atomosphere first i needed sangria needed it a white version mixed with a rhubarbstrawberry reduction was velvety smooth and legit one of the best sangrias ive ever had second we ordered the sea salted potatoes with smoked paprika aioli brought to our table with much aplomb oh my god ive had salted potatoes like this before but this wins hands down no contest the aioli certainly makes these wholeboiled small potatoes not unlike patatas bravas this dish is an absolute winner and a perfect plate to whet your hunger without overfilling you preentreesi ordered the panroasted chicken with heirloom tomatoes and pecorino the chicken was perfect inside and out moist inside and the chicken skin was perfectly crispy oozing with oils and juices with each crunch the beau got the steak frites with yucca fries and a b√©arnaise sauce it came out a bit late as a new batch of yucca fries had to be made but no matter it was absolutely worth the wait mediumrare is the kitchens perfered way of cooking it and it waswowjust wow im also a big fan of yucca so the fries were inhaled by memore than him sorry adam halast the service was great everyone we talked to was friendly and asked for feedback on our meals thumbs up to our sever jessica marcella the general manager both greeted us and sent us off asking our names and shaking our hands so kindthe food scene up in washington heights hudson heights continues to burgeon and rusty mackerel is definitely in the mix now so glad yall are here please stay i insist
in my professional opinion as an americanborn korean this food hits the spot its basically like my mom came over with tons of food and told me i need more meat on my bonesmy food was packaged nicely in paper foldable boxes with accoutrements like kimchi btw the kimchi is fullon doublecomplete authentic it comes free because a meal without it is blasphemy along with a wonderful message from the management you really feel like the business cares a lot about your satisfaction with the new menudespite korean food being really known for the bbq meat dishes i ordered all vegetarian the japchae the dumplings and the pajun the names are kinda outthere and i wasnt sure whether a disco ball was going to pop out of my food but they came through with some great flavor and awesome portions especially the appetizers i got maybe perfectly crisped and puffy dumplings the paejun the korean version of a scallion pancake was fluffy on the inside and also perfectly crisped on the edges my japchae was the slightly sweet and salty mix of sesamesoy sauce flavored glass noodles with marinated veggiesoverall this is officially my goto for korean food in the fidi area honestly they are pretty much singlehandedly repping the cuisine in the area but do a great job at it bonus you can top off your meal with a froyo while youre there
i love the russian turkish baths on street ive been going to this east village institution for almost a decade and have enjoyed their food and services religiously some have complained that the place is small or dirty compared to some of the newer korean spas but to these people i say youre an idiot i would describe this location as cozy with character just like my beloved east villagethe russian turkish spa can be a intimidating affair for the first timer so let me give you some tips that ive picked up over the years first check in with the counter person theyll put all of your personal belongings like phones and wallets into a safe deposit box please note that you will not be able to get your phone and wallet out until you pay so be sure you wont need to make a call you might risk putting it into your clothes locker but they dont guarantee safety not that ive ever had a problemonce youve got your safe deposit key youll be given a locker number this number is stamped on the key and you can wear it around your wrist or ankle youll need to give your locker number whenever you order food or get services for which you pay at the very end please try the food its reasonably priced and delicious russian fare they have a great selection of russian and polish beers and water which you must have while schvitzingthey provide shorts sandals towels and robes i usually bring my swim trunks and my own sandals once ready go downstairs and take a quick shower there are rooms of various heat intensity as well as an ice cold bath to refresh you between rooms try them all in some rooms if it gets too hot you can douse yourself with a bucket of ice cold wateryoull find several employees and regulars downstairs that will offer massages and the infamous platza aka waterboarding if youve never had the platza i recommend it at least once its where you get beaten by oak leaves they have ways of making you talk youll be so glad youve survived the experience youll have a new zest for live for realsif the weathers nice you can go up to the roof and sun on the roof deck you may also see people with mud masks which you can purchase there sometimes i imagine living in ny when this place was the only place you can wash up mind blowingi love to go during the middle of the week and during the day to avoid the crowds i recommend checking out their schedule as they have coed times where shorts are required and genderspecific times where you can drop trou i once went on a mens only day and saw so much penis i cant unsee it on occasion i have rub shoulders with actors here including colin farrell and sam rockwell so thats kind of coolif you do like the place you can buy multiday passes at a discount but keep in mind the business is run separately by weeks its weird each week is run by either boris or david you can tell which week it is by the calendar on their website the prices are the same but when you buy a pass its week specific so keep that in mind my buddy and i split the weeks he has davids weeks and i have boris weeks so were always coveredanyway please come i highly recommend this place happy schvitzing
i wish i had discovered this place sooner the happy hour here is outstanding and if youre a seafood person not something to miss the combination of a vast beer wine and cocktail menu and a ridiculous amount of seafood options is killerthe happy hour special runs for and features beers wines and cocktails pitchers and amazingly sliders of lobster crab cake or fried oysters oh yea raw oysters are just a buck too my person favorite was the lobster roll and unlike so many other places the lobster joint doesnt shy away from giving you heaping pieces of lobster meat my first slider came with an entire claw in it and the following ones were just as hearty what really made the sandwich stand out was the balance between the lobster and the mayo as a person that doesnt love mayo i sometimes shy away but in this case it was spot on and more importantly it was not used a filler to give you less meat the space itself is also a refreshing clean design very tall ceilings inviting long tables built for groups of friends to hang out and tasteful seaside flair on the walls the wait staff was incredible and friendly promptly bringing food or drinks when they were ready and offering helpful suggestions along the way for any fans of good seafood happy hours with plenty of options and great overall experiences i highly recommend coming in here ive been happily showing off the pictures of the food to every person ive seen since i left and cant wait to go back

i have been trying to go to all the bars in nyc that offer a nice roof top viewpatiosetting most roof tops bars are relatively similar nice views overpriced drinks well dressed patrons etc etc ad nauseam this bar hit all those marksthe view here was way better than i expected the crowd was trendycool the drinks were overpriced the music was nice watching the sky change with a soft breeze good company and with the chrysler building in the background was kind of a perfect nightthe roof has nice couches plenty of places to sit and strings of light decorating overhead we got seats enjoyed a few drinks and met a few cool people that sat down to share our table the service was fast and the drinks were very good i would come back here great place to bring a date and accommodating enough to seat a group of comfortablyhere is what made this place really stand out to meguys do not wear flip flops here maybe this is common sense but i am clueless about this stuff we got here and we were turned away for a gentlemans shoe choice the bouncer explained he would not be able to let us up to the pent house because of the guys shoes it really did appear it was out of his hands and a rule he had to abide by understandably the guy saw our disappointment and lent us a pair of his shoes no really bro lent us a pair of his own shoes for our guy to wear and he wanted nothing in return the bar was plenty crowded they certainly did not need our business but the guy actually went out of his way to be able to let us in that was just a really nice thing to do in my book
i love this place and cant wait to come back the benefits of having yelp friends that tell you where the best yakitori is in nycmy friend and i came and ordered yakitori the piece combo panfried noodles yakisoba and octopus balls takoyaki all three were unbelievably good the beef was unbelievably tender the pork was so savory the chicken was solid the shrimp was a little dry but still broke apart in my mouth quite nicely and the veggies the veggies were good too i hate veggies this means quite a lot the noodles were good but no spectacular i think id skip that the next time i come the octopus balls were one of the best ive had but not the best as expected as this is not known for its octopus ballsi cant wait to come back to try the okonomiyaki such solid prices and good service
decided to stop in and have a drink while waiting for our reservation time at morimoto around the corner my boyfriend and i went to the bar and saw that there were no two seats together but a few on either end of other couples the bartender saw us attempting to find seats and very kindly asked other parties to move down in order to make room love it when they do thatthe decor was beautiful and very romantic it made a great accent to our anniversary nightwe sat at the bar and looked at their drink menu i forgot the name of it but i got some type of drink that ended up being to floralherby for me so just sipped on it while my boyfriend fully finished his drink the bartender saw this and very kindly made me another drink at no charge he didnt look offended at all and agreed that the drink is a hit or a miss with peopleafter a few drinks we headed out to make our reservations at morimotos in the end the hostess was very nice when we walked in and the bartender was more than kind we felt welcomed from beginning to end and never felt like a burden even when the bartender had every right to make me feel that way after not enjoying my drink i experienced great customer service and cannot wait to go back to try their food
my hundredth review and a five star this place is specialjk it sucks you should never come here i hope to never see you herethe pork belly is certainly not succulent the yakitori is not grilled to perfection by a single man whose sole focus and dedication is to carefully turn glaze turn impeccable skewers eyes never shifting away the house tofu salad is not generous topped with crack dressing and almost onpar with en japanese brasseries much more expensive housemade tofu the pork katsu in broth is definitely disgusting and not a good idea so just dont get it actually just dont come here ever because hours wait on an average night is a lot more than i am down for just stay away and go somewhere stupid likei dont know somewhere stupid so i dont have to fight for any more seats at my new favorite restaurant in the city the hotpot is all sorts of unhealthy with its not flavorful yet still not light broth and melange of asian hotpot vegetables and paperthin cuts of beefporkthe hostesses are not friendly and accommodating and understanding and pleasant as possible despite the packed little entry way and sometimes impatient patronsbasically dont come kthanksbaifor real though this is my new favorite restaurant i have been planning my days around off peak hours to come eat here actually

fantastic spot cant believe ive never heard of this place being yelp elite and all sarcasm intended apparently u have to know someone or whos been there before to go that always adds cacheti thought the tasting menu at pp was a great deal esp given how much food u get the ambience here is sleek yet not stuffy a great date place for suredish ratings on a yelp scale as good as it gets methinks foi gras soba my fav of the night maybe i was hungover and just needed some comfort soup broth was light yet flavorful and delicious and the fatty piece of foie gras gave it a wonderful umph to the branzino it just looked and smelled amazing charred sides gave added flavor the sound of crackling and bubbling still cooking made it even cooler way large portion couldnt finish it get sea salt on the side to taste tip they should char the rosemary so that u can eat it it smells deliciously aromatic but it would be wonderful to taste had rosemary this style at a random bar food once and it was simple and uni croquette i still prefer my uni unadultered but the croquette had good creaminess and the flavor did not overpower the uni beef short rib raw so tender and fish egg rice bowl good but the large salmon fish eggs r not my flavor vegetable fondue not something id normally order but the freshness of the raw veggies was a nice departure from the crap i normally beef sliders nothing wrong w it but nothing wowed me with this very beefy if that makes sensedrinks were wow burgamot wow good my jaguar never knew whiskey could taste so good w chocolate not overly sweet mint gold kinda like a mojito w some spice came in a very large glass so i suppose if ur really thirsty
there are a few benchmark moments in your new york life the first time you got an apartment without a cosigner the moment you got a room big enough to fit a queen bed the moment when you finally got a grant for that artsy fartsy project youve been working on for many an invitation to the soho house might be the ultimate prize though the soho house to me has always been a distant idea but when i got an invite recently i couldnt help but play drakes started from the bottom over and over and over i was recently recommended as a member and was invited for a night at the soho house i bought a new outfit took my concord jordans out of their air and temperature controlled environment and got into a fancy yellow suv cab downtown i had been before but this time around i got the full treatment and i was very impressed the music was on point and the crowd was oh so good looking im a huge nerd and dont know if i quite fit in but for one night i felt like i was hanging out at the cool tablethe people i met were so interesting and the place really tries to keep the corporate types out which is a huge plus in my book my friend was on a mission to meet some women and about five minutes in i could tell his brain and eyes were about to explode i cant say enough about how cool the crowd was the drinks were very well made i dont know if i am gonna be a member as there is a tiny fee even for invitees but i might have to take the plunge if you know someone that is a member i think you might have found a new best friend
after years of sitting in front of a computer working on spreadsheets and generally getting abused i figured it was worth getting a massage beyond the weak ones you get at a typical spa its a little tough to find but keep an eye out for the signage youll have to walk up a narrow and shady looking stairset before you walk into this small operation upon entering youll be immediately greeted and asked if you have any specific issues back legs sports injury etc you then agree to a set distribution of time between various parts of your body in my case minutes of legsfeet and minutes of backdont come in expecting a light patdown i thoroughly got my ass kicked before leaving they will really apply the pressure on all your pressure points and challenge you not to shed a tear in the process if you have lots of knots youll hear cracking and popping noises you never thought possible in various parts of your body i have a high pain tolerance and i almost screamed mercy a few times during the back portion of the massage elbows are involved a not so strong guy to my immediate side was screaming murder i felt more uncomfortable from the wailing next to me than my immediate pain i had to look up every now and then to make sure no one was actually getting murderedall in all i was sore for two days after and feel like a new man dare you to give it a shot
i am writing this review for the only one thing that i eat at excellent pork chop pork with pickled mustard green noodle soup before i didnt usually come here even though i live one block away i never really liked taiwanese pork chop over rice because i dont like preserved or sour cabbage its not my thing taiwanese food has a lot of this type of vegetable in a lot of their dishes so i avoided this place for a long long timeuntilone day last year my bf convinced me to go with his friend helen for lunch here i was so worried to go to lunch here because i was afraid i wont like anything but helen proved me wrong i walked in late and helen already ordered for us okay ill go with the flow i saw this bowl of noodles on the table it was bright green from the mustard greens in it i was afraid to try it because my experience with taiwanese food has never been very pleasant one sip of the soup and one taste of the vegetables and i was in love wow i was looking for the menu name and couldnt figure it out until recently its called pork with pickled mustard green noodle soup but it was not pickled tasting at all i dont like pickled greens so i do not think it is pickled my bf tried it too and doesnt think it is pickled either there are bitter undertones from the mustard green it is not super bitter but the mustard green has a natural bitter undertone which tastes great its very mild bitter undertone though super mild which i like i dont really like strong sour or bitter flavoring so this soup is perfect for me i have had this noodle every time i visited this restaurant recently its been great every time awesome im glad to have found something i like in a taiwanese restaurant now i dont have to avoid it it is only for this noodle soup i highly recommend this bowl of noodles in excellent pork chop the decor is near none there is nothing fancy in here nothing to look at but i dont care the reason why i am in here i had it even during the middle of summer i was sweating a little but afterwards it gave me a reason to share taiwanese ice with my boyfriend we had red beans taro and condensed milk on our ice that totally cooled us down from the hot soups ice is with toppings perfect i love my bowl of soup
i dont know what has become of me first i waited in line for cronuts last month and now ive waited in line for the first umami burger in nyc on its first day of business no less i hardly ever wait in lines like this by the way its in line and not on line right i may be biased because i was starving i was experiencing voorpret and i felt rebellious for temporarily ditching my selfimposed no red meat diet however after watching fellow patrons and hearing their oohs and ahhs i dont think i was the only one who thought it was all worth it i strongly believe new yorkers are going to embrace umami burger for a very long time one of the logos is an image of a hamburger that also kind of looks like a kiss mark its very fittingwe ordered the original umami burger my favorite all of the burgers are a variation of the original but have additional toppings and condiments this burger includes a handground medium rare patty that really doesnt need any help from additional garnishes it is slightly crispy on the outside crumbly and juicy on the inside and wellseasoned throughout the burger is enhanced with an umami ketchup with strong notes of truffles a sea kelp powder bonito flake and oyster extracts meltinyourmouth caramelized onions an oven roasted tomato shiitake mushrooms and a crunchy and salty parmesan crisp all of this is sandwiched between two delightful softly toasted slightly sweet portuguese buns the condiments are also on the lower part of the entire burger so it hits the tongue first and creates a much more dynamic flavor yum yum yum umami umami umami manly burger burger is excuse the gender stereotype very manly delicious beercheddar cheese smoked and crispy saltonion strings and bacon lardon are stacked high on a very thick patty with each bite juices from all of the ingredients dribble onto the buns and sometimes onto the hands the manly burger is a messy but delicious burger vintage burger is an offmenu item these offmenu items vary between locations and these are the items that make umami burger less of a chain and more of a restaurant group this burger is similar to the original but has a smashed patty i didnt particularly like the smashed patty as much cheesy tots side dish is also an offmenu item as the name suggests they are tater tots filled with cheese and are delicious with the accompanying umami ketchup garlic aioli and jalape√±o ranch dipping saucesthe service is amazingit was opening day but none of the employees were the slightest bit frazzled or angry the gentleman writing down and calling out names was so sweet and apologized profusely for our hourlong wait which was surprisingly much shorter than what i had imagined it would be the waiter who brought us to our table apologized for the wait our waitress jessica apologized for the wait everyone apologized for the wait since it was our first time at an umami burger jessica explained the burgers to us with great detail and enthusiasm she also took our cheesy tots order off of our bill because they arrived after our burgers what i really hope this high quality service continueslikelihood of another visitim usually a pretty light eater but i almost thought of ordering another original burger so that should tell you something im also excited to try the truffle burger and the turkey burger they also have a pretty extensive list of cocktails with names inspired by things around the neighborhood
getting to phd is similar to walking through an airport to find the gate of your plane ids check stamp check then walk straight on make a left make a right get stamp checked take elevator up to the floor where they check stamp again and finally insert drum ruffle here you made it to phd for a good impression of the experience here i suggest you watch this back to phd rooftop view you will be astonished by phds view on nycs magnificent skyline and the empire state building which has a different color each day only le bain might come somewhat close to it when it comes to cool venues with an awesome view the ceiling inside has beautiful jaw dropping chandeliers crowd lots of suits high heeled ladies models mixed with normal looking young people some of them react to having their table with bottle service in an endearing way looking all proud smiles from ear to ear almost so disproportionately happy with this huge significant life event that you cant help but feel happy for them as well all of this is of course in dark contrast with the promotermodel tables where the girls are to look bored when theyre not dancing and where its definitely a faux pas to clap and scream when champagne with fireworks come to the table phd also seems to be used as a parking lot by the promoters hot entourage until they can move on to or marquee music the djs play pretty good dance music here mostly hiphop and top they could tone down the amount of female condescending hiphop they spin too much ho bitch put yer fucking hands up niggas ass ass ass ass but besides that great music dj booth looks pretty impressive its often flanked by gogo dancers and sometimes a live violinist or saxophonist performs along with the beats of the music bottom line phd is professionally set up and run very well put together there is a reason i keep coming back here its got a good vibe and an above decent crowd i love phd on sunset saturdays starts around ideally you go to day night brunch prior or lavo brunch then to phd and then on to lavo or marquee if you have energy left
takashi is a great treat when it comes to enjoying luxurious cuts of beef and experiencing the cuts of organ meats keep in mind many items of the menu are an aquired taste and the small plates and price might be a deterrent if you come in hungry get the kobe chuck flat steak oz steak and rice and you should be able to enjoy the other cuts of beef without worrying that youll be hungry my favoritesnikuuni how can you go wrong kobe slice fresh uni this dish melts in your mouth and you really have to savor itkalbi kobe shortrib amazing and buttery cut of beef the texture was smooth and fatty we got it marinated with takashi saucethe goodtsurami cheek very flavorful we got it with garlic and sesame oil eat bite was delicious and the texture was rough and chewyhatsu heart i liked this a lot ive eaten chicken heart at some yakitori places but never tried beef heart this comes in very small bit size bites you place them on the grill and grill for minute each the flavor is very hearty but not striking the texture is like a smooth pastethe service was fantastic and very friendly and attentive we sat in front of the chefs near the entrance we got in after a minute wait and were luckily because the people behind us were quoted a minute wait and the manager took their numbers to let them know when a table would be ready at no point did we feel rushed and we were able to enjoy each part of the meal at our pacei sat looking at the large warning sign with a silhouette of a cow on it i didnt really get it until i saw the sign from my experience japanese do not eat a whole lot of beef so when they do they explore the small cuts of every part of the cow and discover the flavor of each part thats what takashi is to me beef by nature is a luxury in japan and takashi takes the time and energy to translate the experience of japanese beef eating in america where beef is plenty i learned to slowed down and enjoy the flavors and textures of each parts of the meat its an interesting and delicious experiment
dinner at gotham is a must if youre looking for somewhere nice to splurge after mentioning it in conversation a few times my friend and i decided to finally make a dinner reservation for here on a sunday nightthe restaurant was surprisingly very empty when we arrived but by the time we left around it was almost entirely full which i found very odd for a sunday night another thing i found unusual the number of families dining there with small children the table next to us had two preschoolage children and gotham seems to be very good at accommodating small kiddies i overheard the waiter offering the kids a plate of chicken with shoestring potatoes which was obviously not on their normal dinner menuas for our own food my friend and i decided to share two appetizers the striped bass ceviche and yellowfin tuna tartare our waiter kindly offered to split each appetizer into two separate plates for us which saved us the trouble of having to halve everything ourselves the striped bass ceviche came with several pieces of fish topped with leaves and citrusy bits and the waiter poured a slightly spicy thai broth into the dish id never had striped bass ceviche before and found it interesting because it tasted less raw than other ceviches ive had but the thai and citrus flavors were great our second appetizer the yellowfin tuna tartare came centered neatly on a plate with two pieces of toasted bread and surrounded by cucumber slices dotted with asian ginger vinaigrette ceviches and tartares are probably my two favorite types of raw fish dishes but when it came to these two appetizers i definitely liked the tuna tartare more the tuna was so nicely complemented by the cucumber slices and toasted breadfor my entree i ordered the berkshire pork chop the pork was very tender and i liked the sauce unfortunately the waiter gave me a very dull knife so cutting the pork was quite a struggle i wasnt a huge fan of the vegetables mainly the roasted fennel that came on the side either while taking a break from sawing away at my pork i also tried a bite of my friends entree the maine lobster which tasted buttery and delicious the broth that it came in tasted like lobster bisquebeing the gourmands read fatties that we are we also decided to split a dessert we went with the apricot souffle which was unbelievably good the texture of the souffle was super light and fluffy the apricot flavor was present but not overly sweet and my first thought upon taking a bite was this would make a great tea flavor the souffle also came with apricot sorbet panna cotta extra delicious and apricot slices on the side all very nicely completing the apricot palette then just when we thought wed finished with all of our dinner courses we were also given a small cup of complimentary bitesize financiers that came in different flavors pistachio almond and chocolate a wonderful ending to our dinnerconclusion food and service are both outstanding dinner here doesnt come cheap but its very very worth it
i hate to admit it but im guilty of being a bit of a sushi snob ive been spoiled by places like tokyos fish market yasuda east ushiwakamaru sushi of gari azabudespite my high standards i was absolutely blown away by ichimuras omakase for those of you who are as obsessed with finding the best omakases as i am you must put this place on your list it was absolute perfection you know how sometimes you walk away from a good meal and you have one maybe two things that stays on your mind almost everything that chef ichimura served was memorable and beautifully executed my only criticism is that after for two people i left still a bit hungry we started with a beautiful array of small bites miniature squid torched tuna daikon and a few others the squid was my favorite not only was it so freakin adorable since ive never seen such a tiny squid but it was delicious and had an amazing soft texture next we had uni on top of fish and im a complete sucker for uni so that was amazing as expected i think it may have been slightly torched because the texture was firmer than usual there was also a small dish of sushi with some diced greens on top followed by a light crab soup and finally the sashimi nothing beats amazing fresh quality sashimi that makes your eyes roll back in your head as soon as you put it in your mouth i loved the contrast of the different tastes and textures that ichimura put together it was so decadent and just meltswhen you make a reservation make sure its for ichimuras omakaseits different from the brushstroke restaurant the omakase is in a little room off to the side at person sushi bar its a really intimate setting and an amazing experience

my kind of bar excellent specialty cocktails live band on some days i went on a sunday evening and the place has large windows and very dimly lit with candles everywhere the decor was cabinlike very woodsy its not too loud you can easily have a conversation the place is intimate while still being spacious it kinda has a beer garden feel without the rowdiness the drinks are so unique i was very impressed the prices range from which are not bad for what you are getting i recommend the garden variery margarita kale margarita and the i hear banjos drink which contains moonshine this drink is very strong and worth the the presentation is also very cool i cant explain it just check out the pics will definitely be coming back quickly became one of my favorite barsfyi i read about this place in the new yorker they had an article about the kale margaritas it lived up to my expectations and more how did i not know about this place
large spacious and beautiful lots of other reviews will be way more eloquent than i ever could try to be regarding the architecture so go read thosemain concourse trains in the teens and apple also has a store here now and if you go into the halls youll find a lot of cute boutiques lower level aka food area train tracks in the be prepared to sprint and dodge if youre late for a train thats down here magnolias is down here and shake shack is coming totally made my day seeing that sign id suggest using the bathroom next to shake shackmagnolias because its larger and even if theres a line it goes fast i find it to be cleaner and less smelly than the ones upstairsive come to have a lovehate relationship with gct during peak hours lots of peopleespecially touristswandering around and making it difficult to get past people are in their own worlds which can be so annoying when youre just trying to get outbut i really cant complain gct is in the perfect location to essentially everything that i ever want to go to and while i may have issues with the mta i cant fault the building for that
these tacos are insane i cant think of any better quality mexican food in nyc and ive done suenos dos toros jackson heights spanish harlem etc los tacos no is hands down the best the menucomprised of tacos and quesadillas mostly the quesadillas are the same size as the tacos but griddled and with cheese they also do nopal cactus plates chipssalsa and various mexican sodas the spreadselect your taco filling grilled steak carne asada grilled chicken pollo asado marinated pork adobada or cactus nopal then choose corn or flour tortillas finally choose your extras guacamole cilantro onions and salsa afterwards you can garnish everything with cucumbers limes blistered peppers hot salsa red and mild tomatillo salsa green the setupplace your order and pay at the first register on the right counter of the stand then move over to the left counter give the man your receipt and tell him which tortillaextras youd like there is ample counter space at the stand and along the windows facing w st the localeonce inside chelsea market you will be able to locate los tacos no from a few visual clues its off a southern side passage from the main drag just find the spice store or sniff it out then walk south its directly across from hybird the meali wasnt sure how big the quesadillas would be so i went with one steak quesadilla on a flour tortilla with guacamole to start i love that they dont make you get onions and cilantro i know its authentic but i dont like raw onions and i have a strong aversion to cilantro i sauced it up with both hot salsa and green salsa and then some lime juice after one bite i was in love the steak was so juicy but still maintained the charred taste of the grill the soft flour tortilla was great quality and all the flavors worked together to form a complete package i finished eating but still had some room so i decided to maybe try an overpriced questlove hybird drumstick or maybe some mexican corn from nearby num pang but num pang didnt have any corn and i couldnt shake my desire for another los taco no quesadilla so i got back in the line which was much longer now and went with a pork quesadilla on corn tortilla this time the pork is actually cut from a rotating spit like gyro meat then thrown on the griddle to add smokey char as i waited again i noticed the women in the back actually making the tortillas in house from masa now that is a fresh tortilla i gobbled down another quesadilla and by then i was satisfied though other people could probably eat another tacoquesadilla or chips additionallythe verdicti dont give out many star reviews i mean i just gave one to momofuku ko but like thats ko thats to be expected i wrestled with giving it a because of the disorganized line situation honestly one of my biggest pet peeves of this city is that new yorkers are notoriously aggressive linecutters and on a busy day i could see that being an issue especially as this place gains in popularity which i see happening in a big way however the food is too fantastic to care about any other minor annoyances stars
i would choose this place to be the location of my last meal the fresh and deliciously seasoned seafood paired with a bib and gloves is a match made in heaven there is something exhilarating about diving into your food without worrying about etiquette the place was packed when we came here around a staff member told us the wait would be around minutes she took down our number and told us that she will text us when the table is ready awesome we were actually able to sit down quicker than we expected they offered us that particular table only if we could finish our meal within hour i dont think this is common they probably had some reservations we took that opportunity because we were just so hungry and excited after we saw the menu when we got to the table we sat down and they began to equip our station huge stack of napkins cup of chilled water gloves bibs someone helps you put it on bucketall appetizers come with cajun fries the portions are small we got the chicken fingers pieces and the soft shell crab crab also we got the shrimp and crawfish combo with the boil special sauce it came with corn potatoes and sausages all items were boiled together which created a delicious bag of seafood everything tastes amazing it was more than enough for two people we managed to finish in one hour woohoo no one rushed us though

since the arrival of fatty crab in the fatty crew has been opening comfortable semihip lowkey restaurants exoticized by way of southeast asia across new york city given her mothers filipino roots and her recent travels throughout the region it was no surprise that former top chef contestant leah cohen was tapped to head their latest venture pig and khaopig and khao is situated on a stretch of clinton street that while it has invariably begun the process of gentrification which pig and khao doubtlessly contributes to is not entirely overrun by assholes aside from knowledgeable residents of the area slinking in and out of barramundi and the rushes to prosperity dumpling there is little here to suggest that you are in the nouveau lower east side of insipid bars on every corner instead pig and khao is the boisterous neighbor in a sleepy hamlet truly it is best not to underestimate the obstreperous atmosphere within if you enjoy having dinner with a significant other or date on the weekend but also enjoy hearing them talk youd be best served coming at the restaurants closing or opening primetime seems reserved for the hooters and hollerers the noise is mitigated a bit if you manage to be seated at the kitchen counter as m and i were as an obvious added benefit you get to see the dishes youre considering ordering as theyre prepared for other parties it then becomes a rather difficult proposition to be led by your stomach and not your eyes the plates are surprisingly large but the various sights will entice you to order more than any reasonable person ought to after youve seen sumptuous flecks of pork being braised with various chilies and herbs chaotically piled onto a cast iron pan finished off with an egg cracked right down the center sizzling through the dining room as its carried away try to resist ordering one of your own its nearly impossible equally evident from this seating arrangement is the control with which ms cohen runs her kitchen in spite of the relatively small breadth of the restaurant it holds a sizable number of people at capacity and the kitchen is quite small but ms cohen and her staff pushed out dish after dish with aplomb and what a series of delightful dishes they werem and i began with the quail adobo sticky vinegary garlicky peppery segments of bird that may have singlehandedly answered the question as to why dick cheney was intent on hunting them i had no shame in pulling pieces of flesh from each wing and dipping them into the sauce that had pooled on our small porcelain plate such is the power of a sauce thoughtfully comprised of compatible familiar elements what followed was what i thought was sure to be our moment of truth the sizzling sissig the couple adjacent us smiled knowingly at the telltale crackle having just polished off their own as we mixed the freshly broken egg the lime juice and the caramelized bits of ephemera ginger kaffir leaves bird chilies the aroma became more than the sum of its parts and we could mix no further without trying what was before us the heaviness of the pork and egg was cut by the lime juice but the smokiness afforded by the charred accoutrements enhanced the natural fattiness and surprising heartiness of the pork the heat from the chilies lingered briefly but only enough to assert its presence each bite was addicting and the gambit of finishing the plate before the scattered bits grew cold took on a much more serious air than was necessary after the pan was removed we were presented with our penultimate dish the khao soi a bit redder in color than i had typically seen in chiang mai where the dish originated i was excited for what i presumed to be the additional heat while m was terrified seeing her trepidation the sous chef playfully handed her a few more lime segments but in truth what aided most in combating the spiciness was our side of coconut rice fluffy sweet and utterly saturated with coconut flavor in part thanks to the actual slivers of coconut it was the perfect accompaniment the curry had an admirable depth with the dark meat of the chicken thigh adding additional savoriness and the bitter tangy punch of pickled mustard greens standing in for the traditional brighter cilantro the topping of fried egg noodles was a nod to the typical means of textural contrast between the size of the bowl of curry itself and the amount of rice paired with it we were lucky to finish it especially given the substantial amount of food we had eaten just prior but when i saw halo halo on the menu i knew from the onset that we would be trying it gastrointestinal constraints be damned the flan bits were an interesting twist and a thoroughly welcome one as the dessert was better than i rememberedms cohen i fist bumped you ostensibly because of your choice of as background music but really it was because of your food

the ideal first date date or breakup date i called to make reservations and ask a million questions and adele answered the hostess with the mostess she answered every one of my stupid questions from what the weather was going to be like to what kind of comedy i should expect since i was tight on time she suggested seeing the comedy show first than having dinner most do it the opposite way i suppose she was so helpful and sweet my excitement soared parking if we parked any closer we would have been on the stage lots of free parking scorecomedy club portion located in the basement pretty spacious for a comedy club usually they are way more crammed and you end up sitting on top of others in nyc i thought the temperature was fine but my date a big muscle man felt hot but dont they always no drink minimum or maximum of course you can also order dessert and snacks if you choose to the choice is yours unlike other clubs again the comedians were all pretty good plentiful probably depends how drunk you are or if you actually have a sense of humor i laughed and im a tough personfood wow i almost dont want to talk about it so you guys can be surprised truffle mac cheese crab cakes juicy cheeseburger dumplings chicken pot pie nachos with enough sour cream nutella fondue and i have also had the best dessert i have ever taste chocolate caramel pretzel bread puddingservice on top of adele being awesome steve was my waiter and really i felt like he was my friend or even my family member during the time i dined there he starts with the drink menu i wanted amaretto or malibu and they didnt have either so he was super sensitive about it and told me he would find me a drink that would make me happy and of course he did he suggested the mac n cheese with truffle oil and i could probably eat that dish everyday until im he checked up on us just the right amount of times i wanted him to sit down and dine with us thats how great he was bottom line if you really like someone take them here if you really dont like someone but want to sleep with them take them here just take anyone here or go solo its that worth it
tried to make lori l s uye today but ran late and got shafted by the gay parade like seriously you have to strategically plan which subway you get off and which side of the street to come above ground or you spend hours trying to get around the throngs on foot needless to say i didnt make it in time however i figured i had to try this place out anyway since i spent hrs and about gallons of sweat trekking from the ues down here place better be freaking good i swear gods be great this place is exactly what i imagine a coffeetea house to be small and cozy but not cramped variety of seating so you can enjoy their tasty delights either by yourself at a high top in a section with friends perched in the perfect people watching vantage point or on the little love seat with coffee table and an area rug how quaint the accents wallpaper fixtures and everything about the interior just feels comfortable warm and inviting as far as the libations go the menu can be a little daunting not in its sheer size but in that the concept is a bit foreign i still dont really get it but this is what i gathered you pick a tea they brew it espresso style so you have a concentrated vial of caffeine with which you can mix as you please i like to go with the staffs suggestion in situations like this and we arrived at a black tea macchiato with vanilla flavor and caramel drizzle delish im sure you can go more exotic but i was intent in getting the highest mg caffeine and at for a large thats like the same or less than some faux swill from starbutts or wherever unless you like faux swill then i guess dont come here added bonus i found the check in offer for a pastry and decided on this blueberry thing there was only left so i figured it must be good sheep or deductive reasoning ill go with the latter to feel better about myself luckily the last blueberry thingamajig ended up being a crumbly blueberry cheesecake thing with an ever so slight hint of lemon i think whatever it was divine see the pics i couldnt help from tasting it before i remembered to post a photo id like to try the rest of the pastries too as they all looked pretty awesome note the guy in front of me ordered a sandwich and was rudely awoken to the fact that the portion is quite small and you only get half womp womp womp but honestly why would you order a sandwich here anyway do yourself a favor and try this place out its specialty without the jacked up specialty prices my kind of place

id like to say that no pigs were harmed in the making of this review but with our three swinebased plates unfortunately that wasnt the case after our awesome experience at salinas ill surely be returning back to sample some other tasty animalsfor starters my friend and i snagged the pork belly and the baconwrapped quail off the tapas menu the pork belly served over squash roasted garlic and a vinegar reduction was crisp on the outside but tender and meltinyourmouth juicy on the inside as for the baconwrapped quail the bacon was both crisp and practically fused onto the quail legthis was perfect far too often when a place offers baconwrapped anything floppy bacon is loosely attached to the host food and once you cut it with a knife the whole experience is lostfor entrees my friend went for the steak special a ribeye cut into tender slices and garnished with a delicious and creamy sauce drizzle my slowroasted suckling pig was the show stealer however beneath a layer of crispy skin was a bed of supertender meat that was so soft it actually put the previous pork belly appetizer to shameon the drinks side theyve got a healthy cocktail list with a nice cohort of bourbonbased beverages i went for the sweetish la campesina which came mixed with lavender honey syrup and carpano antica vermouththe food and drinks while a bit pricey are well worth it but the atmosphere and service here really bump the whole experience up a couple of notches first off theres a nice rusticmeetsclassy mix of exposed tumbled marble polished wood and smoky mirrors that really set apart the vibe inside indirect lighting splashing the walls makes eating and looking around an easy task while still allowing for a dim datefriendly spot as the night carries on theyve got a lovely back garden area beneath a retractable roof but the inclement weather that evening kept us from getting a chance to experience the open roof our server brian was spot on food runners fully described the dishes as they came out waters were topped off and napkins even refolded when one of us left for the bathroom donald one of the owners made the rounds checking up on the tables and ensuring that everyone else was having an equally positive experiencei really enjoyed dinner at salinas and look forward to returning when the weather heats up so we can take advantage of that open area in the back
living in hells kitchen has its pros and cons cons being that youre relatively close to where all the tourists are and can be limited in the sense of subway accessibility however hells kitchen has some amazing restaurants including the amazing wondee siam this place is the best thai in hells kitchen hands down and possibly the best thai that ive had in the city to date wondee siam is located right on avenue between and its a small little restaurant without any flashy signs so you might accidentally miss it when walking by the restaurant isnt large by any means as there are only about tables for people to dine atthe first time i ate here i just ordered off of seamless my order showed up within minutes which it should considering i live two blocks away and tasted amazing i ordered a complete meal for two this included tom yum soup crispy pork with basil pad si ew wondee samplerin total my meal came out with tip to just under my meal as expected was damn tasty i knew that i had to at least stop by and dinein once to get that nice and fresh tastemy second visit was during lunch during this time they have a lunch special for your choice of entree comes with a salad and two spring rolls what a steal i decided to go with the pad kee mao wpork and an additional order of their amazing amazing crispy pork with basil the pad kee mao noodles were cooked just how i like them they were nice and chewy and when mixed in with all the veggies and pork gave off an amazing fresh taste with every bite the salad is your typical garden salad with miso dressing and the two springs rolls come with a side of sweet and sour dipping sauce the absolute best though is the crispy pork pretty much its pork chop diced up into smaller pieces fried with a spice and topped off with some basil if you decide to order anything this is the thing to get hands down my favorite dish here by far especially for lunch this place is an amazing bargain for you get an entree and appetizer not many places can offer that kind of price married with great tasting thai food ive had my share of mediocre thai in the city as well as across the country and wondee siam is definitely a standout whether you decide to seamless a meal or stop by to dinein you wont be disappointed
i was expecting kopi kopi to be a small divey coffee shop and was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a very spacious coffee lounge that also serves indonesian food this is one of those coffee shops where you can lounge around all day okay maybe not all day the space looks like the typical indonesian living room minus dutch colonial era tiles and high ceiling i dropped by around on saturday and thoroughly enjoyed my experience at kopi kopi everyone was so friendly and genuinely excited to be there there were people behind the counter which made the experience a bit hectic and confusing as we had one person taking our coffee order another person fetching the actual coffee and another person ringing us up i was so excited to learn that they serve indonesian food in addition to serving beverages crafted with indonesian coffee beans we ordered iced coffee risoles and soto ayam chicken soup unfortunately i made the mistake of bastardizing the iced coffee by promptly adding milk before chugging it so i cant really speak to the quality its on the lighter side and not the best iced coffee ive had but also better than starbucks ill have to come back and actually enjoy the coffee next time the risoles an indonesian croquettelike snack with portuguesedutch roots typically stuffed with chicken carrots peas and creamy filling are heated up in small batches so they stay fresh somewhat crispy on the outside and perfectly warm the risoles is a bit small but its also only so cant complain the soto ayam chicken soup is simple light and flavorful again the portion is small the dishes ive tried so far are simple indonesian comfort food the kind youll find if you go over to an indonesian friends for dinner i will definitely be back to retry the coffee and when i dont feel like trekking it to elmhurst for indonesian food
this is my new favorite place to go uptown i never thought i would find a place so classy around st for those who are offended by this statement cmon be real its not exactly the classy neighborhood with a mcdonalds and crown fried chicken every blocksi am however extremely surprised when i enter the bar and feel like ive been transported to some microbrewery in the east village or les the lighting is just right and the tvs act as distractions to those that feel like avoiding eye contact the beer is cheap for heavy hitters and these are pretty rare to find on draft even if you go to a gingermans or dba the overall atmosphere is friendly and refreshing i can even picture a fireplace in the corner if it werent so packed with happy peoplei keep coming here because the people are really friendly ive always met interesting people when i go for a drink and its always worked out for the best the free popcorn is always a good touch and i dont think the music is too loud because the sounds of laughter and chatter are louder if you go for some bar food you must try the peanut butter jelly burger it sounds weird but its amazeballs
it is impossible to miss the pastel blue facade of saleya nearly identical to that of tribeca pediatrics around the corner both owned by dr michel cohen earlier this week we visited saleya for lunch currently the streetlevel cafe is open for lunch and the bar seems to be accumulating a bottle collection the area upstairs is still under construction but will eventually feature a tapas bar the decor is colorful and bright accentuated by tall windows and enormously high ceilings the menu features soup salad and sandwiches i looked forward to warming up with a bowl of soup so i ordered the seasonal soup option which was vegetarian potato cauliflower it was tasty light and refreshing he ordered the char grilled vegetable sandwich with bread filled with grilled zucchini eggplant peppers herb goat cheese and pesto it was delicious i am looking forward to ordering this at my next visit which will be quite soon

sometimes the entire fusion concept can be taken too far on the upper west side a few months back some friends of mine were walking down amsterdam causally read a restaurants sign and had to stop to laugh in disbelief french mexican really when i heard korean fried chicken and jazz in the descriptors of this establishment i was curious yet not ready to make fun just yet i cant immediately knock a place that some people boast has the citys best fried chickenone of my dearest culinary partners in crime aviva g and i suggested a nice postchristmas dinner date in my mind i pictured something more in the vein of a restaurant in st marks place a belowstreet level restaurant with low ceilings dim red lighting and extremely crowded and teaming with people the sound of hot grease sizzling in the background as the open kitchen was visible to all in the tiny space when i arrivedi got foot tall ceilings walls lined with jars of infusing fruits and literally records a dj spinning jazz tunes overlooking the huge open dining area a gorgeous eataround piano and just this classy air surrounding meaviva and i were unsure about soju infused korean vodka so we split the four flavor sampler flight snow white yogurt which tasted like melted pinkberry passion mint pink lychee and our personal favorite blood orange blood orange is an absolute must upon our inevitable figure return we plan on buying a large carafe of it later in our meal we each got a mojito she got passion fruit i got pineapple coconut both were perfect the problem with both the soju and the mojitos is their lack of any alcoholic flavor we ended up feel very good by evenings end needless to say i recall saying to aviva i know im feeling these drinks because im having trouble enunciating my words of course putting extra emphasis on correctly enunciating the sentence because i knew of my thenlack of enunciation ability thank you soju and mojitos next we split the pepper jeon ground beef upon red pepper slices and grilled corn on the cob seasoned with paprika and cojita cheese i dont think i can ever eat corn any other wayfinally the pi√®ce de r√©sistance the fried chicken drumsticks and wings double fried fresh to order glazed in an absolutely delectable soy garlic sauceits the stuff dreams are made out of this is food porn at its finest the outside crispy the inside hot and absolutely perfectly moist the chicken that surely unwillingly sacrificed its life did not die in vain i can tell you that muchfusion at its finest folks aviva and i are already plotting our return we were almost speechless at points of this dining experience amazing i am one of those people that truly has an aversion to the m word however it gets a pass here because it is what it is
i survived the cronut line i was also the first in line at am the line did not start to get ridiculous until about the cronut limit has officially changed to how were they well the hype is pretty warranted after waiting hours for dab to open i impatiently tore into my precious cronut a smile spread across my tired face the dark circles vanished i was in ecstasy cronuts are officially awesome they are crisp yet soft at the same time they exude a perfect amount of sweetness the only complaints i have with them were a i was only allowed and b i found the lemon slighly overpowering im really just nit picking lets hope cronuts become a true craze and other bakeries start mass producing them thanks dom you rock
i absolutely love a good beer there is nothing like finding a pub that serves up a terrific selection of quality brews when i found out that this new bar was taking the spot that used to house the old brother jimmys location i was ecstatic its about time that the uesyorkville area is getting quality businesses up here and the third avenue ale house is a much welcome addition to the hoodwith the second ave subway coming we have recently seen an influx of new nightlife businesses open up shop around here bars restaurants gastropubs cocktail lounges and others that are really a step up from what we normally had i have even seen reports of more on the way too its getting to the point that the much maligned ues is slowly becoming a drink and foodie hot spot there is more of a reason to stay local now and party up here rather then heading to the overhyped les or trekking over to the other boroughs i just hope those who live downtown and out there stay away and dont discover what the ues has to offer nowadays or everything will become too crowded lolwhen i dropped into this slick new beer pub i was very impressed the old place had become decrepit and worn down i had my fun times in that old bar but it just lost appeal as my beer tastes became more refined the new pub has an outstanding selection of domestic and imported craft beers around on tap atlantic brewing co blue boint bear republic flying dog oskar blues carton brewing brooklyn brewery founders great divide green flash ommegang mahrs brau christmas bock lagunitas ithaca sierra nevada harpoon cider schmaltz and so many more that i cant recall the bartender louis was a friendly gent and was easy on letting me try a few samples which he gave me in a cool mini mug i went with that christmas bock and it was outstanding the pints run in the range which is a little pricey but these are quality beers here and i dont mind paying a extra buck or two to enjoy the nice environment they also have a selection of cans and bottled beer along with some special reserved bottles and a featured can if you are into the harder spirits they have on hand a very nice scotch whiskey tequila and bourbon list along with a small selection of wines happy hour decor is very manlylike with mostly dark woods exposed brick walls copper roof and designer lighting plenty of seating in the bar area with about four or five flat screens there is a large back room with even more seating and a large flat screen on the wall nice dimly lit ambiance when i was there candlelit and some great tunes playing from led zepplin to a mix of old rock the owners did a wonderful job renovating this spot to give it appeal to attract beer lovers to those on dates to people hanging out for a night to those who want a bite to eat and anyone else dropping in right now they are waiting for con ed to hook up their gas and power to the kitchen so they have a limited menu but its still a nice eclectic mix of food items i had one of their soft pretzels and this thing was delicious came out big hot moist fluffy with a nice seasoned crispiness on the outside the inside was filled with gooey cheese oh my also served with dried chorizo slices and deli mustard i spoke with one of the owners and he told me they will be pumping up the menu to have more choices once they are fully operational and brunch too i spoke with a few of the staff and everyone seemed very friendly and attentivebefore i left i was treated to a beer on the house a nice touch as a way of welcoming me to what will become one of my favorite new spots to down a pint its right up the block from where i live which might be dangerous to my diet and waist line it will be a locals favorite around here for sure its already one of mine and im heading over for a beer there shortly
this place was fantastic my friends and i came here for dinner on a monday night it was snowingrainy and right when we arrived someone greeted us and took our coats loved the attentivenesswe ordered the baby beets to start im usually not a fan of beets but this was one of those exceptions i had heard great things about the spaghetti but decided to go with the short rib agnolotti because i wanted some meat my friends ordered the spaghetti and red snapper i tried both dishes and thought they were great and i thought the agnolotti was fantasticthe bread was also a highlight they brought out types of bread plain and bread with meat rolled within it with a nice array of spreads olive oil eggplant buttermeal came out to about per person including tax and tip this included drinks i ordered a pear cocktail which i thought was very good will return
if the words hot sticky and meat make your juices start flowingyou either love beef jerky or are a dirty pervert who needs to get their mind out of the gutter i stumbled on this place accidentally while wondering around chinatown and was attracted by the displayed of different types of grilled beef jerky pork and beef options in both spicy and mild flavors this is different than what comes in the bags you buy at the the meat here is tenderized and grilled which gives it a smokey and toasty flavor that compliments that caramelized glazed that each piece of meat is soaked in its perfect as a snack on its own or chopped and served over rice check it out for something different and unique
be careful its extremely hot our servers each time they brought out a plate of foodi always like to hear this when eating out theres nothing worse than getting some lukewarm food and everything we got that was supposed to be served hot was piping hot very fresh and extremely deliciousthe food here is incredible they start you off with the complimentary ciabatta with whipped blue cheese i started to wonder why it was taking awhile for the bread to come out but when it finally did i realized it was because they were baking it fresh and it was well worth it this was some of the best complimentary bread ive had recentlyfor starters we got the caramelized chicken wings which were pretty good though im not really into chicken wings so much we also got the house made refrigerator pickles and butter roasted peanuts this was the only mild disappoint out of everything we ordered the pickles were actually quite refreshing to offset all of the fried heavy stuff but the peanuts were not great they were surprisingly flavorless and could have used some saltbut the main entrees and sides are where this place really shines we got the cherrywood burger which is really just a fancy big mac this is the only time i think ive ever seen a double burger at a fancier place and it was delicious the best part of this dish though was the side it came with the french fry ends with bacon crumble this was a genius alternative to the typical side of regular fries its served in a little that you should get a spoon to scoop up to get a salty delicious mouthful of those fries and bacon so good if you dont get the burger make sure you order this as a sidefor the other entree we got the eel stuffed chicken ive definitely never seen such a thing before and it was amazing eel and chicken together at last at first glance it just looks like some really good chicken with some deliciously crispy skin but then once you cut into it you realize there is a very generous layer of deliciously buttery eel stuffed between the chicken and its skin this dish comes with a small side of pretty tasty vegetables but the real way to go is to order the side of bone marrow clay pot rice as i mentioned above everything here is served nice and hot but i actually managed to burn myself on this dish but thats a good thing this was a very generous portion of piping hot sticky rice with some bits of bone marrow scattered on top this was the perfect complement to the deliciously rich chicken and eelas usual at places that happen to be very good even though we were extremely stuffed we just had to get something for dessert since everything else we ate was so good we opted for the interesting sounding crunch and munch crumble pie this was a hot gooey very satisfying pie with a buttery crispy crust my only complaint is that there wasnt enough of it also it could have used a nice side of ice cream to offset the heat and extreme sweetness of the pie but still this was an awesome dessert and i would happily get it againthe atmosphere in here is very nice too and the service is impeccable this place is great and i hope they take off and get the success they deserve with such good food i will definitely be back soon to try the ribs which everybody else here seemed to be getting and which looked just as delicious and satisfying as everything else we ate here
so i went back to club a this past friday after scoring another groupon deal thank goodness for groupon bc it helped confirm that i am indeed in love w club a steakhouse from the minute we stepped inside where we were greeted by a lovely hostess and then brought to our table right in front of the fireplace as was requested and so kindly met by bruno the owner we were again in love the downstairs room in which we were sat was a beautiful red with many black and whites on the walls and a warm fireplace at the end it reminded me of strip house but betteroverall the service was great our waiter was attentive friendly and courteous and everyone that brought our food or serviced us in other ways was extremely professional and personable the food filet mignons medium rare and medium mac cheese garlic fries bacon and calamari were all extremely good and we were both happy that our steaks were cooked to perfection being a steak lover theres nothing more annoying than ordering a medium rare steak only to get it medium at club a steakhouse though they did it just rightafter this second visit i believe that this will now be our goto steakhouse its classy tasty friendly warm not too loud and everything else that i could want when i want a nice intimate steak dinner bonus points to for them allowing you to bring your own bottle they have a nice selection of wine but since the hubby and i have grown quite the collection of nice wines we figured wed bring our own and make it feel that much more specialthanks club a for a wonderful friday night and for being everything that we could ask for
there are two things that are abundantly the tokyo fish market is a surreal place that must be visited at least once your the airline industry is out of control and makes very difficultlucky for nyc there is a restaurant that brings the same quality traditions and experience of a real fishmarketside restaurant to midtown just to be clear this isnt your off sushi joint from brooklyn so dont expect to get away with a check my bill for at the end of the night was more than i spent for dinner at morimoto nevertheless this was unlike any other japanese dining experience ive had morimoto included and that experience fits the bill like a glovefor a genuine experience you will want to get a place at the bar where you food will be served out to you on a long paddle by a team of chefs who sit on their knees awaiting your order there is an extensive drink menu but the one i recommend is the lychee martini plan on ordering at least there is also a nice selection of soju and sake i also recommend starting out with a sushi roll or two i can honestly say without a single degree of exaggeration that this is the freshest and the best tasting sushi i have ever had second best was in aruba this was the best first best i think by now you are seeing why you cant just order one of something for my entree i ordered the sea bass i was expecting a big entree plate with some jasmine rice side of veggies and the fish nope close your eyes and put yourself in the tokyo fish market you point to a fish they salt it stick it on a skewer and broil it no heat lamps fresh fish turned into broiledcooked fish on plate coming to a paddle near you surreal presentation taste experience everything and its simple no complicated flavor infusions or molecular gastronomy here a meal at inakaya would not be complete without an order or two of green tea mochi freshly pounded on premise with a side of real red beans and vanilla ice cream its safe to say that ill be back here again before i take a trip to tokyo unless the airline industry eases up or i win the lottery
seriously could not be happier with my new warby parker specs overall experience at this locationfirst off i had no idea wp existed in soho let alone their actual headquarters the space is ultra trendy clean and thoughtfully designedorganized the showroom is smaller than one in the meatpacking but it does not get as hectic so theres plenty of room to walk around try on some glasses and have an associate at your side when you need himhertheir collection is fantastic super fashionable and affordable i bought frames for and added ultra thin index lenses for the noncoke bottle look since my prescription is so high for totaling to for glasses its unreal you cant even get that price at a costcoglasses ship in exactly business days which is just the cherry on top of an excellent eyewear servicedefinitely going to splurge on another pair since im thrilled about the ones im wearing now of course when you buy a pair wp gives a pair to someone in need see how it works all the more reason to come back
i have been here a lot this is one of my favorite bars in the west village the bar is decorated in an eclectic homey way old wooden picture frames candles mason jar vases and a nice brick wall with hanging window panes i love the decor here the place is welcoming and warm the style of seating is shared and often times you will be sitting at a large communal booth with other bar goers i like this the food menu is small but the grilled cheese is mighty the bar menu is typical though they do have a pretty impressive craft beer selection the service is average this place is always crowded so coming early is key if you want a seat of a place the crowd is laid back somethings great place for a date to hang with a group of friends or to hit up for happy hour if you come here too late though it can get too crowded
adhd fine dining dressup atmosphere great food and service perfect for business date or parents sit farther back in the atrium great bytheglass wine list in case youre on flu meds and dont want a bottleatmosphere this is the old cru and is quite elegant a lot of men wore jackets i came business casual straight from work and felt fine but i can completely see how others might prefer to be dressed up its a modern atmosphere the old restaurant here was french modern and the decor is comparable the place is long and skinny in shape this is why i prefer the back room also you can have large groups here they appear to understand quite well how to make these work i can see this being a fine place for a business meeting though tables are intimately close and you can definitely hear conversations at the tables next to you while this is a great place for a date i also think it would be the perfect place if your parents were in town the crowd is really mixed i want to say its midtown but i could see ues and well heeled downtown coming here midweek for a date i cant see this place being a preparty spot but then youd blend if you were in that mode so i wouldnt rule it outservice outstanding people were available but not overly attentive the waiter really knew the menu and answered all spotlessly kudosgrub there is an extensive and wonderful menu i start with vino because why not it was a tuesday so we were by the glass plus i had just taken my flu medicine i had the barbera i oddly knew this bottle going in so was happy to see it as an option the other by the glass wines are all great italian wine years i love this because so many italian restaurants will fail to indicate the years on the by the glass list and you end up drinking bad wine by the glassa complementary amuse bouche arrived once we ordered on this particular evening it was arangini di riso which my perma yelp italian list copilot mr t informed me was a very italian constant in his home growing up meaning orangesized ball of rice orangesized ball of happiness might be more appropriate yummmy so delicious was the amuse bouche i could not wait for the courses to arrive the menu is seasonal so this review is for the winter i had the tomato and cucumber salad mr t had the crispy salad both were simply and delightfully executed its winter so you need to give the body fuel to warm itself we therefore ordered the beef and veal meatballs very recommendedi had the rigatoni with sausage which at is one of the more affordable dishes on the menu i was being treated but it was exactly what i wanted and i recommend it highly it was slightly on the oily side come on theres sausage how can it be otherwise mr t had the codfish which was quite delectabledessert was wonderful mr t demanded the fresh mix berries zabaione while ive never had this before to judge i watched mr t lick the glass clean so i think it was really good the sorbet selection was divine yumdefinitely give it a try

by the end of our meal my husband and i were giggling with joy no we werent drunk well maybe a little we were in love with the foodbeing contrarians we did not start with the eponymous bone marrow app we shared a salad dressed in pumpkin seed vinaigrette lovely but wished there was more cambozola blue cheese and the lamb ribs the latter had been brined they call it lightly sauerbratened making them unbelievably flavorful and tender there was not enough of the creamy caraway yogurt underneath sadlyduck schnitzel beautifully fried and moist it came with classic accompaniments spaetzle cucumberpotato salad and wolfberries are they goji berries but with a cooler name my husband ordered the fallingaparttender short ribs pizzaiola sp from the other side of the menu with a pool of polenta and greens underneath and a red sauce on top this combo of hearty flavors was supersatifyingwe were stuffed but we felt it our duty to try the gingerstout cake and the berliners while the doughnuts were lovely that cake was the best damn dessert weve had in ages really deep flavors perfect for the season and thats when the giggling beganthe service here is a treat intelligent professional perfectly coordinated and devoid of gimmickry and pretense the one exception was the blankfaced hostess who seemed so mournful that i nearly asked if she was okfor the record we loved the crazy wallpaper its like something in your grandmothers house but on steroids like marrow itself classic with a whole lot of twists
watching my favorite uruguayan bassbaritone erwin schrott just feet away from me was absolutely priceless this was the perfect venue to grace his rojo tango a sexy and passionate collection of songs by famed composers astor piazzolla pablo ziegler and juan carlos cobian his performance at this very intimate and classy night club with only seats made us feel as if we are at an exclusive private event i highly recommend to get table seat instead of bar seat its a night and day difference there is a min charge for food and drink order and although the venues primary focus is the music the food wasnt bad at all i particularly enjoyed the oysters and burrata get those for the appetizers if you want to meet the artist then this is the place you have a high chance of meeting him in person i not only got to meet erwin and got him to sign my cd and had pictures taken with him but also i got to meet his famous soprano girlfriend anna netrebko many opera royalties including his gf anita rachvelishvili olga peretyatko michele mariotti and placido domingos brother were sitting nearby our table which was almost surreal this is why i love ny great music at a beautiful venue at very reasonable price id definitely come back
cash only no individual slicesi am so happy that theres a grimaldis nearby if youre a tourist youve probably heard that you must visit the grimaldis in brooklynwell now you dont have to go so far and you dont have to wait in line for minutes to try their delicious pizza we came here on a saturday evening at and we were seated right awaythis place is definitely filled with more family type customers but they are planning to have beeralcohol served soonordered the regular large add italian sausage with mushroom huge pizza and total cost was so affordable i love the thin crust and the mozzarella and sauce is oozing to perfection i usually only eat two slices but i find myself eating sometimes four slices which leaves me in the food coma stupor after wards but so worth itthis is a new location so theyre still working out their quirks ie table seating to accommodate everyone comfortably they are still waiting on their liquor license they are adjusting to their clientele of little kidsfamilies bonus they have live piano and singing entertainment saturday evenings
michelin stari was not able to get a reservation for dinner time so i opted to test my luck by coming in at for bar seats the wait was about minutes which was not too bad at all service was just as good and maybe even more personable at the bar we had a great bartender who checked up on us regularly the place definitely gets crowded so try to make reservations way ahead of time the decor is woody and rustic which gives it a more personal look to the frog legs with pesto gnocchi this was one of their specials for the night and boy that gnocchi melted right when it touched my tongue i loved the pesto sauce that complimented with the roasted bone marrow huge bones with delicious toasted baguette pieces and jam so worth the fat going into my body the biggest marrow dish i have had the black label burger it looks simple but the prime dry aged meat was so juicy tender and melts in your mouth i am not sure if it is worth the but at least it was amazing meatdrinks yo macallan on the rocks and a murray sour with yo yamazaki whiskey delicious and gives you a kickdefinitely will be coming back everything was delicious and definitely made me go to food heaven for the night michelinrated kathy approved

cash onlylove this place chinatown ice cream factory is very small so be prepared to eat your ice cream outside or walking to your next destination there is also a park down the street you can sit and enjoy your dessert atthe lines can get very long but most of the time they do move fast so know what you want and have your cash ready on weekends and holidays there can be a lot of tourists that ask to try all the different flavors so it holds up the line so if you dont want to deal with that then go mth like i dothey sell the scoops in cones cups or different size jugsquart pint to take home and they other items too ie toppings my favorite flavors so far have been black sesame mango taro lychee avocado pistachio almond cookiethe only flavor i didnt really care for was the red bean but that was only because the actual read beans they put in the ice cream were rock solid when i was trying to bite into the causing too much of a texture issue when trying to eat it if those werent in there or if they were softer then i would easily add it to my list of flavors i lovenonetheless the ice cream here is great pricey but great now if only i can find a way to get the quarts of ice cream from here to my uws apartment without melting p
cheese is my version of crack there i said it im a bit obsessed when i got word that one of my favorite cheese shops im looking at you murrays were opening an actual cheese bar and serving wine with this goodness i could not wait to head over to bleecker and try it if youre at all into wine and cheese you must must must try this place however and i may regret actually typing the next words into the same sentence but here goes it was almost too much cheese i know i know that sounds ridiculous especially for a place known specifically for its cheese it would be a crime to not have dishes covered in gooey cheese cheese compliments and cheese sauces but it is a lot so in an attempt to avoid the cheese overload i think you need to approach murrays cheese bar in one of the following ways and you will be guaranteed to have a practically perfect evening the preevent cheese plate and wine this can be done either at the bar or a larger table with friends colleagues family in town or a date basically you are simulating the old school at home murrays experience that you know and love and kicking it up a notch this is done by sitting at the actual bar and having an entire wine menu to choose from instead of relying on what youre friend has in her apartment also you have the more vibrant feeling of being at the wine bar and if youre with work friends or on a date you dont have to worry if youre apartment is clean enough to host a wine and cheese party you can enjoy the excellent service sip your wine just a glass or if youre like me split a bottle and take in the buzzing atmosphere the have plenty of options are far as cheese plates are concerned or take it one step farther and do an assortment of meats and cheeses everyone here is fully qualified to help you select cheese to your hearts content you will be in a lovely mood to head to the next stop on your nights agenda the main event cheese lover dinner this is when you make murrays your main event this one works especially well on a weeknight or when you want something more low key you should probably also bring along fellow cheese loving companions the menu itself is pretty cheese heavy and in this case i would not suggest a cheese plate before your meal i had and loved the buffalo cheese curds i am from buffalo and this was a taste of home for me very authentic roasted beets with whipped chevre and sea salt grilled artichoke hearts and the murrays melt the later is a gooey grilled cheese accompanied by tasty tomato soup for dipping you can even add bacon if you like we tried the buratta too but i wasnt as the postdinner cheese as dessert so youve just finished dinner in the west village and youre not quite ready to go home yet you still want a nightcap and a couple of bites of cheese to go with it heres your spot open till midnight wed sat and sun tues murrays is ideal they even offer a cheese dessert celebratory cheese and wine with a groupthere is a large table in the front of the restaurant which would be idea for a group gathering for the pre post or main event well unless of course you are choosing to head there with losers douchbags or annoying unfriendly types then youre on your own good luck to you
did happy hour with some guy friends last night to catch up with them after a few months they mentioned wanting to do bbq nearby and to be honest i didnt have high hopes its a fun neighborhood with some real culinary treats but upon arriving here i didnt see the magic no sparks flew etcbeing three men and myself we ordered i forget exactly how much of brisket smoked sausage and pulled pork along with medium sides of edamame stuff sweet potatoes mashed and baked beans upon sinking my teeth into a slab of brisket then i saw the magic sparks flew i knew i was in lovewith their brisketholy mighty quinn barbecue where have you been all my lifethat being said upon further discussion ive decided that everything was amazing and really up there for me in terms of bbq flavor quality value etc however the award for best brisket ever for me personally still goes to hill country but mighty quinns brisket is a very very close for me completely blowing out places like blue smoke and dinosaur bbq out of the watereach bite of their brisket was insanely juicy tender flavorful and the burnt ends were simply orgasmic they have an amazing hawaiian sea salt on each table in a stylish metal grinder and this complimented each meat were ordered perfectly their inhouse made bbq sauce is also delicious not too thick and gloopy which im not a fan of but instead a nice opaque consistency that doesnt overpower the meat and still lets other flavors stand out all i needed was some acidicvinegary sauces available and i would have been more in heavennow brisket is by far one of my favorite meat offerings ever but allow me to elaborate on the other meats we annihilated the smoked sausage was delicious perfectly cooked juicy and all that good stuff it was a little spicy for my tastes but still really friggin good the pulled pork was delicious but could have been more seasonedor perhaps seasoned with more interesting thingsim hispanic where i come from pernil is all the rage and its seasoned differently so obviously this is all subjective but it was still fantasticthe sides were also enjoyed by everyone i have to note that im not normally a baked bean fan but mighty quinns baked beans were pretty damn delicious far superior than any other baked beans ive ever had at any similar establishment my one huge disappointment was the lack of potatoes i mean real potatoes not that mashed sweet potato crap i mean like pomme frites or even better some garlicrosemarythyme seasoned roasted potato chunksin all fairness and for full disclosure purposes they did have pomme frites on their menu with a strip of paper across it that said coming soon but soon was not last night and i was very disappointed that something like any other side was considered before potatoes which pair perfectly with meat to me its the equivalent of going to a wine and cheese place and being told that the cheese is coming soon and being offered crackers instead sure its yummy and not bad together but not prioritized not cool i know i was not the only person there last night who felt cheated having to eat meat without potatoestheir beer selection is interesting and not incredibly diverse but still a good mix with something for everyone plus other beverages for those who arent into pairing their bbq with alcoholic libationsalso id like to note that on our way out i took my canvas tote bag with me and mistakenly left my really nice looking coach crossbody strapped hobo bag for the guys out there this means its a big pricey sorta designer bag with plenty of interior room on the chair i occupied during dinner and one of the guys that worked there literally ran out of the restaurant shouting arms flailing to get our attention so that he could return my bag with all my belongings intactthat simple kind action is what took a star dining experience straight to a i suppose theres no sense in being so upset by the lack of potatoes since they did note that they were in fact coming soonif youre coming with a group or on a date this place is totally dateworthy then i would suggest calling ahead and making a reservation my party and i only waited about minutes for a table but i could easily see things getting pretty crazy here during peak eating hours i seriously cant wait to come back here and enjoy more food mighty quinns is mighty awesome
day dry aged porterhouse need i say morei went here a while ago and never got around to reviewing this place if youre going to go to a david burke restaurant you have to go all or nothing for the best experience therefore i opted for the porterhouse while it may seem a little pricey at it really isnt it serves people and comes with sides it was extremely filling and the presentation was very professional and beautiful dining at its finest the establishment is pretty fancy and very spacious theres a rooftop bar that seemed really cool but there was a private event going on that night id like to go back and check it out highly recommend this place for a special occasion birthday anniversary engagement etc its sure to impress and food is topnotch
i love you coco you made my days at baruch that much brighterespecially when i brought unsuspecting bubble tea virgins who then choked on the tapioca despite my warningsthis place is nice and bright the staff always had a smile when my friends and i came in and they were helpful when i too was a bubble tea virgin and unsure of what to get i always got the milk tea whenever i went my favorite was with the caramel i brought my friend from london here and she got something with mango it was pretty good but i feel like im committing bubble tea blasphemy if i dont get my regular caramel milk tea i love that everything is fresh the tapioca is the perfect size and its tolerable there used to be a bubble tea place near my home and their tapioca was gross but the best the best was when my friends and i stopped by on a friday night we were clearly drunk off our asses yea happy hour and instead of getting all huffy and annoyed because we were taking too long to order the people at the counter were laughing at us the place was empty at the time that we came in so i guess we were their entertainment for the night bubble tea is better when youre drunk try it next time youre near this place just dont choke on the tapioca seriously that stuff is dangerous if youre not expecting iti am long overdue for a visit gotta find a bubble tea virgin to bring along for the laugh
takashi is my new favorite restaurant in ny its absolutely amazing for those of you who are looking for something adventurous and off the beaten path its also a super fun date spot if youre looking to impress a foodie who has tried it all who would have though that raw meat would be so decadent and addictingheres what i usually getraw nikuuni uni sea urchin on top of raw chuck shiso leaf and seaweed this is probably one of the most amazing things ive ever eaten i actually insisted on ordering two orders last time i was here i think it would be on the short list of things that id want to eat if i only had one more meal on earth yooke thinlysliced chuck eye tartare with raw quail egg yoke the waiter pours out the egg yoke from the tiny little speckled shell and mixes it into the tartare the first time i tried this i was a bit skeptical despite the beautiful presentation it looked a bit like little mound of ground beef with a tiny egg on top my skepticism was disarmed at first bite and now i order it every time im back delicious grilledhorumonmoriawase chefs selection if you want to try unusual cuts go with this it typically comes with sweetbread liver heart and two types of stomach my favorite was the heart because it was super tender with the sweetbread in a close second the only thing that i wasnt crazy about was one of the stomachs because it was too rubbery definitely ask the server how long each cut should be cooked because that will have a large impact on how it tastes theyre happy to cook it for you as well sakehakkaisan from niigota dry crisp and delicious when you order sake they bring out a tray of all different cute little cups for you to choose from
erhhmmyygawwddd i die cuz this place is so amazingly good when people say finger licking goodit actually applies to the boil ive wanted to try this place since it opened and finally did after our texas friends were insistent that we had to gowe had planned to go at but like we all were late or on time in nyc terms good thing jimmy c went early and put down our names since they call you when your table is ready we went across the street and grabbed a couple of drinks while we waited we were seated around in the back past the bar there was a chalkboard behind our table that myself and my girlfriends felt no hesitation in vandalizing we left the ordering to the texans and found ourselves elbows deep in pounds and pounds of crawfish clams oysters and crab the sauce is honestly the best thing ive ever had in my mouth seriously theres probably tons and tons of butter but i dont care we dipped everythang in that sauce to be honest thoughthe crawfish werent my favorite its just so much work for so little meat i loved the crab and clams though and even the potatoes sausage and corn tasted better with that crack sauceugh if only it was bigger and the wait wasnt so long id probably go every day and be pounds
fukurou opened in late december of to remarkably little fanfare as the first stateside venture of one of tokyos more prominent restaurant chains i was surprised by the complete lack of publicity surrounding its arrival however i was also thrilled as it meant that simply walking in late one evening was actually possible a frustrating rarity in manhattanon the night nancy and i came a few weeks ago about of the other patrons were japanese and many seemed to be friends of the staff in other words the restaurant still seems to be something of a secret our server almost looked bemused in handing us our menus the owls perched along the counter top and general atmosphere of joviality in the kitchen did little to dissuade his or our smiles as it was early february and new york seemed hellbent on making up for lost time with regards to its not so frigid winter we elected to start with some sake to warm ourselves the sake menu is surprisingly varied and positively affordable our tokubetsu junmai was only eighteen dollars as was nearly every other type of sake and when it came in a bamboo stalk serving as a carafe it only felt like more of a bargain the fact that they have an asahi kegerator and the fact that they dont mark up the drafts to exorbitant levels is icing on the imbibing cake soon after we poured our first masusjust kidding its so rare to see those silly wooden boxes anymore of sake our first plate was placed before us the seared fatty salmon seared was in this case being rather generous with the term the fish appeared to have scarcely glanced the pan and i mean that as no disrespect the salmon was raw and was all the better for it the searing of each edge was enough only form the most delicate of crusts the sprouts topping the salmon probably had more of a crunch to them but that is how the dish was meant to be the crisp freshness of the vegetables combined with their innate vibrance as sprouts was a wonderful foil to the fattiness of the fish and the saltiness of its marinade if our next dish had not been set down in such a timely manner i would have contemplated scraping my chopsticks along the plate to ensure that we had gotten everything but once our next dish was presented the aroma made it difficult to think of anything else the zuru teba liberally seasoned and ran through with skewers were so tempting that nancy and i forewent the appropriate dignified approach of gently sliding out each skewer letting the meat come off with it and instead brutishly yanked them out and ate with our hands our server came back with napkins chuckling all the while in truth the wings are so tender that ones approach to eating them is largely irrelevant at the culmination of your efforts youll find the same lemony garlicky salty slightly sweet morsels of chicken no matter what means you took to reach them our next two plates were brought to us simultaneously although it was unclear if that stemmed from the fact that they both were porkcentric or from the fact that we were eating at a comical pace both the grilled black pork belly and stewed black pork belly on sight alone looked to be winners but upon tasting the stewed version was far superior the grilled version was cooked a bit too long and was a little tougher than it should have been it also did not retain much flavor from its miso marinade likely another unfortunate side effect of too much time on the grill the stewed version however was rich smoky meaty comfort at its best the soft boiled eggs melded with the remaining broth rendering the fare even more substantial the shavings of scallion did little to convince me that i wasnt spooning my way towards an early heart attack but i loved every moment of it the final number in our swift succession of plates was the taro korokke two fried balls of mashed potato sweet potato in this case filled with ground beef and on this occasion a bit of carrot as well the breading was light and crispy and the filling was nowhere near as dense as a typical korokke the kewpie mayo and diced tomato that accompanied them was a nice touch in short nancy and i enjoyed nearly everything about fukurou it was unpretentious almost universally delicious uncrowded and supremely inexpensive and to boot we only sampled perhaps a quarter of the menu in my selfishness i hope this restaurant stays lost in translation
the eleven madison park experience is unbeatable in new york it is not so much the surfeit of food or even the consistency of quality that impresses as much as the ambiance the attention and the accouterments that render an interesting twist to the mechanics of mealmaking not to forget my delightful companyno that is not a reference to mister hanks who was holding court at the next table to ours as only an aged version of josh baskin canwhat pleased me also was that eleven madison park has such staff in their employ as a wine director and a bar managerwhen you pay for an expensive meal you like to know that the restaurant is splurging as well equally pleasing was their ability to cater to a vegetarian palate in a surprisingly seamless manner matched only by their desire to pamper and please every patronthe sixteencourse meal had its statistically inevitable ups and downs the black and white cookie the squash roasted salsify with wheat and walnuts the baked potato and the parsnip roasted with sesame and parsley are fresh in the minds eye ably complemented by a printed menu that i hope to preserve at least until the next time i move apartments the most impressive item in the series of desserts was the maplebourbon barrel aged with milk and shaved ice i wish they gave us more of that to take home rather than the granola but i am not complainingthey were quite generous about giving us two bottles of the granola for the roadthis was only my second time at the restaurant and the new team seems to have done a magnificent job of preserving what was essentially right while tweaking or transforming other elements of the experience i hope to be back soon
murrays does not hold a candle to the excellence that is tompkins square bagelsid say its a neighborhood secret but its not much of a secret the lines are absolutely epic but im serious when i tell you they move quickly you wont wait more than minutes despite the person line snaking through the restaurant to the garden out back theyre hipsters that own logistics a rare and coveted combo theres a guy designated for ordertaking and ticketdistribution to the bagel preppers who work seamlessly in concert with the cashier girls its a work of artand now on to the actual bagels jalape√±o cheddar cream cheese has officially changed my life i keep wanting to try more of the offerings bacon herb wasabi cream cheese french toast bagels with chocolate chip cookie dough cream cheese but i just cant tear myself away from the spicy cheesy spread i love oh so much their sandwiches look fantastic too avocado red pepper eggs turkeyany breakfast combo you can dream they can create i shall visit every saturday until the end of time

the owner orhan yegen gets an a for differentiation presentation and pricing and sadly for attitude as wellstarting from the name that doesnt include any reference to turkey the name of a city or of a municipality in turkey to the cool ambience that reminds one of a mediterranean bistro sip sak declares itself different and captures ones attention all the way throughthe menu changes frequently and having dined on close to half a dozen occasions across summer fall and prewinter ok still fall ive had the pleasure of eating different dishes that stay true to their turkish roots but still remain accessible to the dining population of midtown i am not saying clueless but lets not forget this is still turtle bay only a notch up from murray hillits safe to try anything eggplant from the refreshing and cool fried eggplant cubes with tomato and garlic to the moussaka or the smoky eggplant salad they are uniformly well executed the hot yogurt soup is popular for good reason and the chargrilled octopus sizzling shrimp sigara boregi with the tangy cheese are all thrilling presentation is different and so even though youll be eating the lamb adana listed under spicy hand chopped lamb kebab also available at dozen of turkish restaurants the interplay of seasonings and textures fried pita onions with sumac all enhance the experience its unlikely that you would have had anything like the ground lamb and rice filled cabbage rolls or the baked green lentils with ground lamb at another turkish restaurantthe bread is baked on premises and unlike the lavash served at other restaurants the pide is fluffy usually warm and coated with nigella seeds the desserts might be the usual fare but the baklava is nuttier than most versions you would have tried and my favorite the almond pudding is the lightest silkiest airiest almost mousse like concoction ive had in the city ive tried different versions and while they hold back on the almonds compared to beyoglu or a la turka would be the one i find the best in the citythe price points are excellent only one dish is pricier than and this is achieved with a keen sense of balancing portion sizes so not all dishes are meze but the sizes arent such that youll ever leave sip sak feeling stuffed service is usually great there is a sense of urgency even fear while the volatile owner looks on which may lead to another server following up with you for dessert when you had just placed an order with another one im willing to cut them slack for its a unique dining experience
lets discuss life without a computer when you basically live alone are on holiday and are too good for a television a heroin overdose would be more stimulating thanks to me being an idiot and the most expensive cup of coffee ever this is how i rang in meaning the dq employees could have hurled gross things at me and i would still give them a star rating for fixing my laptop in an expedient manner but there were no gross things they were wonderful personal professional up to and including the timely phone updates the entire process took less than solid days even with the ordering and shipping of special parts during the new years week was it free or close to free no but it was faster than the apple store and regardless of the expenditure a working mac air that doesnt type out hieroglyphics is a lot better than another night of hulu plus on an iphone
la grande pomme cranks out some righteous sandwiches this is not your typical sandwich shop this place takes the art of sandwiching is that even a word to a whole notha level as evident by their innovative offeringsi went in today with a friend and i ordered the superior di pisa which was superior and he ordered the lambwich the ingredients were fresh and the infusion of flavors was fantastic we both felt that our sandwiches were among the best weve ever hadi also feel that la grande pomme is one of the upper east sides best kept secrets its a great addition to the neighborhood and you can tell that the super friendly guys running this place are putting their hearts into what they are doing it definitely shows in the foodif you are someone who regularly walks past and thinks about giving la grande pomme a try think no further treat yourself to a special sandwich and support a local business that is trying to make it in this great city we live ini look forward to my next visittip if youre looking for more than a lunch sandwich they offer dinner on friday and saturday nights
my bf new job is a couple of blocks from here and he has been coming here for lunch every now and then he mentioned it a few times now and today we figured lets get brunch herethere was a mini line but it went by quick on sunday afternoon we ordered thighs drums wing side of fries and coleslaw and soda that cost us first bite of thigh omg where have we been its so much better than any other places we have been in the city we went with all classic instead of mama els they were moist and super tasty it is also very reasonably priced in my opinion the slaw is fresh and not drenched in mayo they serve boylans soda on fountain so it was a nice little treat outside of your regular cokepepsi productsone thing i really liked about this place is you get to pick your choice of meat so instead of your typical or piece chicken places you can order all thighs or all drums or all wings or even breasts they are priced per piece so pick and choose what cut you likei cant wait to come back for more chicken
i had the pleasure of attending a few parties at offsite which is an event and meeting space in midtown this place is ridiculously gorgeous its basically three floors of a design and tech dream the main floor has a beautiful shimmery screen on a product display wall on one side couches and huge tv screens on the side and a kitchen in the back if you look up you see a mezzanine room overlooking the main floor upstairs features floor to ceiling white boards guests were all over that in a hot second and a huuge removable conference table its a lot of fun standing by the rail and looking at the main floor the underground floor is designed sort of like a classroom with really fun and happy colors everything is just really beautiful even their bathrooms i really loved the spacethey also put up a realtime twitter tracker on one of the screens which was a blast i kept tweeting with the hashtag they gave us for the event and seeing myself on it overall i think its a genius space i cant wait to be back
review i dont believe in love at first sight but i really do kind of sort of love this place from the start growing up in seattle ive had more than my fair share of incredible asian food jordan ss review of this place caught my attention made a reservation via opentable and they only had an early dinner slot im glad i made that reservation the place was packed and it seems that everyone also had a reservation when i heard about pig khao i was picturing a haute bourgeouise asian fusion place with ridiculous prices i was surprised to see how reasonable prices are beer and allyoucandrink selfserve draft are we still in manhattan i wanted to order just about everything on the menu because almost everything had some sort of pork in it and i can never say no to pork exercising some selfcontrol to save room for the halohalo my fiance and i decided to order the pork jowl salad pork rinds sizzling sisig pork head and coconut rice i went back and forth on wanting to also order the crispy pata comparing pictures on foursquare and yelp for a few minutes but glad that i didnt the portion is pretty filling the pork jowl salad was very refreshing pretty sure there was zero veggies in there other than the cilantro this is definitely how all salad should look like with pork rinds on top it was tasty and they put just enough fish sauce to add an interesting taste to the mix without the overpowering fishy smell the pork rinds were perfectly seasoned and peppery dont be afraid to order the sizzling sisig yes its pork head but its diced into little cubes that you can hardly tell what it is anymore this dish is amazing the fatty part just melts in your mouth and the leaner meat if there is such thing in pork is cooked to perfection as for the coconut rice i prefer the indonesianmalay version that is less sweet but the coconut rice here is pretty bomb too finally drum roll please the halohalo i have a weird affinity for halohalo if we ever meet in person ill tell you the story its shaved ice with condensed milk coconut shavings and an unnaturally purple ice cream on top thats ube flavored perfect way to end your meal service is great friendly and unpretentious space is clean and the bathroom too food came out quickly needless to say ill be back

when i first moved into the east village over ten years ago i saw three europeans building a bar on a desolate street in alphabet city and thought to myself this place is gonna to close in a year there was no foot traffic and alphabet city was sketchy at best ten years later the keybar has proven me wrong thank god in the past ten years attila gyuszi and their fantastic staff have built a vibrant neighborhood friendly venue that has created a sense of community the last ive heard there have been almost thirty couples who have met at the keybar and have since been married how many are still married is anyones guess ive also spent many an orphan holiday with the regulars at the bar with a generous happy hour live djs and a goodlooking and friendly staff the keybar is the east village destination some have deemed the small bar a dive but its got more of a lounge feel many of the regulars have commented that the bar serves as the neighborhood living room with a working fireplace friendly staff and always a few regulars on hand there is an awesome happy hour special that runs from from tuesday through saturday and all day on sundays and mondays the way the special works buy your first round and theyll give you a ticket which you can redeem for a drink of the same or lesser value any time any day if youd like to get a pricier drink you can pay the difference on the card i challenge you to find a more generous happy hour in addition to the happy hour special they have a birthday shot special where you buy a round of shot for your party and theyll buy you another round this special is good a week beforeafter your birthday and good anytime as with all bogo specials i recommend tipping on the service not on when you pay youre a grownup act like one i find sunday through tuesday are pretty lowkey no pun intended and serve as great date nights wednesday and thursday start to gear up as the weekend approaches and live djs playing the hits friday is their big rock night often featuring coowner gyuszi behind the decks saturday features coowner attila da hun spinning tech and soulful house if you come youll find a lot of regulars that are fiercely protective of the bar but if youre cool well welcome you with open arms stop by and youll usually find me tapping my toe by the dj booth or chatting with the beautiful staff say hi i dont bite hard p
if the corner bistro was in my neighborhood it would be my neighborhood barburger joint the burger was excellent so good that i forgot that i didnt ask for cheese until i was over half done now i wonder if cheese would have made it any better or not juicy beefy flavor packed perfection dont you dare ask for it well done philistine the shoestring fries were nondescript and probably out of a bag but i didnt come for the fries the service was excellent the server was attentive and friendly and my burger was served quickly since i dont like beer gasp i ordered an original sin hard cider it starts off strangely since its fermented with champagne yeast but about half way thru not so bad if they carried woodpecker i think id commute to corner bistro every day hell i might move into the neighborhood and sell my body to pay the rent if you knew me youd know im not kidding
the teas here are awesome and the service here is excellent i wanted to pull down a ton of tea tins to sniff and the gentleman that was helping me happily and patiently obliged the tea here tastes as good as it smells i sampled the fantasy island outside a tropical flavored black tea and it was delicious but i ended up getting a cup of the salted caramel black tea with some milk and agave syrup to sweeten it it is sooo good it tastes so rich delicious and flavorful ill definitely be back to buy an ounce or two of it i walked away with a few ounces of loose tea that i cant wait to try and im sure ill drink up quite quickly ill definitely be frequenting this place for my tea needs

magnetic poetry can be contageous if you click on the photo youll see post your own magnetic arrangement house made goldfish at the bar locally sourced menu wow and magnetic poetry for your dining entertainment like lw oyster co is certainly a welcomed addition to the neighborhoodi was having a steak across the street about a week ago and noticed lw had popped up wandered in close to pm and took a look around great looking creative space with fun grown up toys had to try a few drinks the bartender made a fantastic manhattan and apparently the chef used to work at per se the food that i had was delicious but it was stiff competition with the drink ultimately the three chefs all beautiful women next to me and i seemed to keep drinking and when i woke up the next day i wished that i had tried more of the food ouch hellloooo hangoverif i lived nearby this would be a regular haunt fantastic employees with pleasant personalities and passion for what they do if youre a fan of almond their sister restaurant you may like this place too i like it better they have less bread date rating up scale very friendly people dining herestrong suggestion come hungry bring your fun friends they will appreciate a chef who clearly likes to play with food and decor well done very well done
you guys this place is legit cool i came here for drinks the other night and i was impressed great place to bring a date have drinks with friends or to grab a bite to eat i really dig the vibe there are a few places to sit around the bar and near the entrance and there are also tables in the back for larger groups i like the decor too it was trendy chill and well done the music wasnt too loud and the layout of the bar is very accommodating the staff was nice and the wine recommendations were good the location was also clutch for me it is really close to all the trains in union square which is a good central meeting place for a lot of my friends i will definitely come back
the girls and i met up for a little catching up i always find that a sign of a good time is when you meet up with your girls set a time limit to leave and always go over that time limitby almost hours to be exact thats exactly what happened the food was no short of spectacular and the service was impeccable hakan one of the owners was so very sweet attentive and really made our dinner an experience when we asked why was the place called the quarter its because there are partners and each one owns a quarter of the restaurant the ambiance is warm cozy and delightful i personally love the mannequin in the bathroom that if you arent very careful and had one too many glasses of wine you can mistake for another person not that it happened to me im just sayin we decided that the menu had so much food that we wanted to devour that we each would get a dish and just share it three ways genius totally my idea we ordered the cowboy ribeye which came with duck fat fried potatoes omg omg and a side of creamy b√©arnaise sauce i really wanted to pour it all over my body thats how good it was but that totally would have been inappropriate we also had the hanger steak and my dish to share was the short ribs nothing short of amazing with mashed potatoes i hope my friends dont read this review i was suppose to cut my short rib into even thirds for sharing but i may or may not have done so so as to ensure i had the larger piece shameful i know however we then partnered our food with the quarters amazing wine selectionand let us not forget dessert bread pudding banana spring rolls with a cilantro sauce and a peanut butter and chocolate dessert whose name i forget but i can still remember its deliciousness on my palate to end this was such a great catch up session with my girls and the quarter added so much more to the experience
the first thing my chinese dad said when we walked in were never coming back here againok just because a chinese restaurant has a bunch of white people in it it doesnt mean its badonce he calmed down and we got seated and he actually tasted the food i could tell my dad could appreciate that the food was actually really really good even though he still didnt want to admit it he just complained about how there too many tourists and how they werent coming around with carts like he is used to with most traditional dim sum placescomplaints from a grouchy old chinese man aside though this place has some really good dim sum we were in a big group so i got to try to several dishes the standouts for me were the house special roast pork bun huge and delicious for only which is not bad for a good pork bun this size in the city and the sticky rice with chinese sausage and of course you have to end with the delicious fresh and hot fried sesame balls with lotus paste these were excellent here as wellthough it may not be like your traditional dim sum house i would definitely recommend coming hereas long as you are with some people that can appreciate something a little different and as long if you get here early if you come on the weekends because it gets packed
totally love this place ive lost count of how many times ive been here its a great place for family friends or even a date the food is inexpensive and the portions are more than enough for one person per plate on fridays they have a live musicianband singing spanish ballads from to hes an amazing singer and worth seeing thats definitely a night to check out guadalupe the wait time can get a little crazy here and they do not take reservations on a weekend you can wait an hour to be seated i suggest the churrasco and if youre not driving a guadalupe margarita their signature drink parking is tricky in the area i some times resort to using the under ground lot on sherman ave and st take it easy on those guadalupe margaritas its their strongest drink thank me later

i was craving japanese bbq and looked towards my fellow yelpsters to lead me in the right path and as always they didwhen you walk in you are asked to take your shoes off at the door and place them in a cubby had to capitalize that for some folks because i had no idea i was going to have to do that by only skimming through reviews but if its capitalized itll catch some attention pcontinuing on we were lead to the very back room and got a corner booth i love the low tablesbenches that give the feel of sitting on the floor without having to deal with any of the downsides of it the ambiance was really great from the lighting to the wood decor to the lovely faux outdoor setting they have on the other side of their dining room window all of it was amazing and made me feel like i was seriously out of new york minus the annoying guests that sometimes find themselves here nonetheless the place just has a great vibe to it once you walk through the doorwe ordered one of their set bbq dinner specials and loved absolutely everything all the dishes were flavorful and their side sauces really helped bring out a lot of different flavorsthough the staff was a little hard to flag down to get our check they were very nice so it makes up for it in the end
ill be honest me and my fellow yelpers were suspect of all the five star reviews and half expected an envelope of cash to be delivered with our desserti licked the plateto start we shared the marrow the radishes and some of us had oysters marrow was good and the radishes were different but interesting they are served with a healthy swab of dijon butter and salti had the duck and it was off the chain srsly cooked to perfectionfor dessert we all split the profiteroles the mousse and the tart we had several bottles of pinot very very reasonablei wish i had more hands so i could give this restaurant four thumbs up
poutinethats all i have to say im not canadian but i was told of this canadian delight its almost like their national dish or something ive been to pommes frites before but never given a thought about their poutine ever bc pommes frites is known for their amazing sauces which i must say they are all really delicious and it all depends on your mood to choose one or maybe choose a sauce to change your mood you know poutinewhat is poutine its the amazing belgium double fried french fries that pommes frites are famous for smothered with a delicious and savory gravy intermixed with cheese curds a semi salty creamy and smooth cheese hungry yet it can get pretty heavy so for you can split a large with someone or for get a small by yourself both of which are just fine with mecall me if you are going im definitely down with being canadian now to get to canada to get the real thing

shortys is very close to my office and despite it having been open a yr i think i still had yet to stop in i told mike about this cheesesteak and craft beer bar and he declared it relevant to his interests and the chosen venue for our double date which we scheduled for this past saturday cheesesteaks are yet another guilty pleasure of mineno forget it i think theyre awesomeits a nicely designed space almost like a gastropub but with a menu completely inspired by philly cheesesteaks galore yuenglingbattered onion rings assorted hoagies and even hoagie salads we split appetizers and ordered cheesesteaks everything was delicious i stuck to a classic cheesesteak with whiz and fried onions plus lettuce and tomato in a feeble attempt to add some nutritional value to it i was impressed with the rolls which are apparently brought it in daily from the city of brotherly love and the quality of the meat which can often be stringy i will say that the sandwiches are huge and can really be split by two people if you arent famished as for the drinks i was delighted as always to see southampton publick house brews on the menu for what is essentially a beer bar shortys offers an extensive cocktail menu as well the bartender has a good pitching armthe service was friendly and attentive and didnt mind that we stayed for a while in our booth deep in conversation ive spent a decent amount of time in philly over the yrs and feel that shortys is not only a fitting tribute to a cool city but is also a great bar with a fun concept
benjamin steakhouse is an incredible experience the high ceiling the detailing in the architecture and the dim lighting all add to the ambiance of the room we sat downstairs near the fireplace where ricky took care of us i knew going in to order bacon slices and i have a love for crab cakes so those were immediately ordered as well they came out quickly and were delicious one of the gentleman at the table wasnt crazy for the bacon one of his pieces was slightly gristly the crab cakes were crab no cheap filler or breading we ordered steak for medium rare despite having at the table creamed spinach mushrooms and a baked potatoonce the entree arrived the dining experience became extraordinary ricky served everyone a few slices of the porterhouse he demonstrated that the steak was so incredibly tender by their dry aging process that he could cut through the thick steak slice with nothing but a spoon as we ate ricky kept adding additional slices of the porterhouse to our plates although he had at least other tables i felt as though he was always available when needed the stand out side was the creamed spinach i definitely recommend itin comparison to a other well established steakhouses in the area i give benjamin the highest regard they provide the taste and flavors of peter lugers but blow them out of the water when it comes to service and atmosphere the steak is beyond amazing and i highly recommend benjamin steakhouse to anyone
progressive thai comfort food let that process in your brain for a hot minute because that is exactly what youll get here at ember room youll find that over the course of your meal that these four little words found on their website pretty much sum up what this place is all about what drew me to ember room is the slick and glowing red modern decor i have a short attention span like a gold fish or a puppy so naturally i am attracted to cool shiny bright stuff like cats and children are i am such a sucker for cool stuff and ember room fits my usual the staff is so friendly here everyone is smiley and so helpful as we got the menu the first thing i notice is the chefs unique and memorable name chef ian chalermkittichai the next thing i noticed was the drink menu thank goodness because a good cocktail was needed each of us tried a different drink and it was hard to pick a favorite i had one thousand and one nights which is a creation with ingredients gin fresh blueberrys and strawberry liquor our server made really great suggestions for drinks and for food and was not pushy at all next on the agenda was to get some chow because we were all starving for apps we shared thai pastrami meatballs served on a hotplate green curry lasagna and thai tacos all had really interesting presentation and equally good taste we also ordered a volcano chicken which they bring on on fire which has a really amazing crispy texture and a korean bbq friend rice this was a good blend of asia fusion modern risks with a splash of comfort food i havent been so pleasantly surprised in a while especially since i just found this place by chance
hearth a word whose teutonic origins cause both those who speak it and those who hear it to conjure visions of stoked fires and sweeping wooden eaves it is no wonder then that in this house that comfort built chef marco canora focuses on rustic simplicity and pronounced seasonality in his menu i tend to find that heavily seasonal restaurants peak in autumn given the timing of various harvests and crop cycles combined with our instinctual nature to seek out richer heartier sources of sustenance given the opportunity that ms birthday presented taking her to hearth was an easy choice to makenestled into an unassuming corner of east street with only a swath of brick gilded by a backlit steel sign to mark its entrance hearth exudes a certain confident charm upon catching glimpses of merry diners through the expanse of windows you will see that hearths confidence is not foolhardiness on entering the swath of brick from the exterior morphs into a tableau that envelops the restaurant and the adjacent bar copper pots hang dramatically on the wall gleaming under what feel like individual stage lights but that is where the drama ends for this is a place of comfort the lights are dim the seating is plush and the tones are hushed though they were few in number the large groups that were present were mercifully quiet not boisterous this is a restaurant for a t√™te√†t√™te not a girls night out before making the dubious stumble into the lower east side after m arrived the ma√Ætre d seated us along the aforementioned wall of brick leaving us with our thoughts and our devilishly enticing wine menus the connection hearth holds with terroir becomes immediately apparent at their first perusal if a country produces wine it will likely have a place on the menu having planned not to drink that night the wellcurated list proved a formidable test of my conviction though i ultimately won out i would surely ask for a pairing on my next visitwhen our waiter his madras shirt alone further evidence of the unpretentious cozy nature of the restaurant came with our menus for the evening we were presented with equally difficult choices the entire bounty of fall seemed to be represented on it we decided to start with a salad of warm autumn vegetables and a plate of a sort of ricotta terrine with fall greens the vegetables were absurdly fresh and shone through their light dressing enhanced by their warmth the ricotta was fluffy creamy mild and sweet in short everything a good ricotta should be for our main courses i chose the braised rabbit while m chose the poached cobia her cobia arrived steaming from the kitchen with matsutake mushrooms farro and brussel sprout segments strewn beneath it as a finishing touch mushroom consomm√© was poured over the proceedings the expected and realized traits of the consomm√© could describe the dish itself earthy light and subtle the farro and brussel sprouts were necessary pillars of firm texture holding the other elements together my braised rabbit was cooked wonderfully and the bones intact presentation seemed to heighten the pastoral flavor profile of rosemary olives and sofrito the accompanying polenta while a bit heavy on the rosemary was equally agrarian though it was served in lovely copper pots in retrospect i rue not partaking in the tasting menu seventysix dollars for several courses of this caliber is a steal but i digress being a birthday dinner in spite of our mutual lamentation at the thought of consuming still more food we ordered dessert my apple cider donuts were like none other ive had in the best way possible flaky yet dense and cakey paired with the lightest of whipped cream they were heavenly when ms pear tarte tatin came bearing a birthday message ascribed in chocolate i was grateful at the demureness with which it was handled no awkward requests no secret parlance just a restaurant performing a kind gesture that the tarte itself was a luxuriously sweet vehicle for the ever so slight acidity of the pear was merely an exclamation pointhearth like many restaurants in new york does not receive the attention it merits it and the homeyness it evokes are taken for granted in the constant desire to seek the new the bold let the bold and the new clamber over one another for the titles bequeathed by the sceneseekers yet and still mr canoras creation now approaching its tenth year lives and we are all the luckier for it

oh yes please can i just leave it at that ok ill elaborateive been to a few speakeasies and this one was certainly the most exclusive if you dont have a reservation expect to wait and not even at the bar outside a friend and i stopped by rang the doorbell an adorable accented bowtied butler comes to the door and asks for our reservation we clueless dont have one so go down the street for a few minutes for a drink at blt before returning for a second tryhe lets us in and the bar is standing room only we pass by a few plush couches with tables extremely sexy its all dates besides my friend and i and im envious of their wellinformed boyfriends who brought themthe cocktails are pricey and delicious i tried too many but recommend the bramble gin and muddled blackberries and the selfstarter ill be back as soon as i have a chanceneed to impress someone
wow what a find but i suppose i shouldnt expect anything less than a very classy and truly enjoyable venue since it was recommended by the head of pr of the company for which i work we had a company happy hour here with about people total tribeca is not exactly a convenient location unless you already live or work in the area but luckily our office is walking distance to the neighbourhood the service was great the wait staff was never far from our tables to make sure we had everything we need and the happy hour food menu was great from the baconwrapped dates to the pulled pork sliders to the tuna tartare tacos most of all it just had a great ambience and its definitely a spot to take someone if you want a place thats intimate but also casual
let me disagree with some of the reviewers belowyou dont need to read macbeth to appreciate this experience in fact it might help to come in with a totally blank slate and let your mind wander that being said most people naturally felt the need to follow a narrative so they kept joining the annoying and sheeplike packs who were probably being led by inside plants its funny how reluctant most people are to carve an individual experience which this is supposed to beof course i gave in as well and joined the big engrossing scenes like the minotaur orgy rave sacrifice and the dinner finale as well as several bar scenes those are definitely the highlights but the various sets are all individually awesomefrom the moonlit forest to the candy store to the taxidermy gallery you wont see everything which is reason to return at some point if you can stomach the hefty admission fee againits a wonderful bit of modern participatory theater that everyone except folks with serious health problems and those mortified of the dark should check out
ive been working on this review for months my then boyfriend now fiance had made reservations here for our six month anniversary words cant do the experience justice the best dining experience i have had and it was everything and more i had expected from a michelin now restaurant in the world all senses are engaged during the mealwe did the course tasting menu every single dish was to die for we asked for a tour of the kitchen as well which was a wonderful experience i was really surprised how clean it was despite how busy they wereour initial server was okay but he was shortly replaced by a much friendlier and personable server i wish i could remember his name because he added that extra flair to the dining experiencethe end of the meal is of course always going to be the most memorable and best part of the night my fiance had planned to do a tableside proposal however i foiled his plan we were talking about proposals and i told him i considered restaurants to be too public of a place for my liking last minute he had the staff move patrons from the small private lounge area after our last course we were guided to the private lounge where they had two champagne glasses placed on a table my favorite song playing on a small speaker in the background as requested by my fiance the whole staff cheered as they popped a bottle of champagne bottle they asked us to wait so they could get the glasses ready for us after we were done they actually packed the vera wang glasses in a nice box and boxed the cork in a small cute box with an emp ribbon so sweet sentimentalit really is the best dining experience and if i could give them extra stars for their thoughtfulness i would thank you emp
duuuuuude this random arcade is awesommmme they have street fighter ii paperboy fight champ frogger ms pac man the original marvel vs capcom and pinball machines with beer holdersto think my boyfriend and i actually found this place my complete mistake i was surprising him with tickets to a touring film festival but we were looking for a place to enjoy drinks and i was going to take him to max fish because he likes arcade games and such i ended up taking a wrong turn onto essex street and we both stopped in our tracks immediately upon seeing the arcade machines and bar setup and hopped inhe was excited with the games they have the nostalgic bad arcade pizza their pie sits under a heat lamp in a big oldschool box thing and nostalgic hot dogs on one of these spinning griller things think only they had no hot dogs on it this night lol and he enjoyed some red winei was excited for the games and for the cool selection of seemingly curated and probably constantly rotating domestic craft beers coney island lager much yay and seasonal foreign brews as wellhad a nice chat with the manager too about wines and their friendly bartender told us that they had just opened about weeks ago this place is a breath of fresh air for adults who like things like fine gaming pinball machines fine winebeer and bad pizza lol i look forward to hangs here again very soon
ive been holding off on writing this review for a while because i dont know if i can properly put in to words how much i like this placeits not a place to get hammered although ive definitely done soamor y amargo is a great place to go with a friend or two to enjoy a few perfectly concocted drinks and good conversation on paper the drinks might not be for everyone but ive never brought anyone here who didnt love them many have been surprised that they didi prefer coming weeknights when its nice and quiet especially wednesdays when souther is behind the bar i hate weekends pretty much everywhere
i had to update my review because of my most recent experiences at kyotofufirst they have the most delicious chocolate muffin i have ever eaten in my life it is incredibly moist and has just the right ratio of chocolate chips to cakesecond i like the soymilk soft serve more and more every time i eat it it is so delicious and there are always different flavors to try last but not least the most recent time i went to kyotofu i had come down with the most painful migraine of my life just a few minutes before dinner the server must have noticed how terrible i looked because he brought over some onigiris for chinh t and me on the house which he thought would help me feel better as i ate my mushroom salad he asked if i were feeling sick and when i admitted i wasnt feeling well he asked if i wanted to drink some broth instead i nodded in agreement expecting just some warm soup but he brought over an entire soba for me to eat and also said it was on him i honestly would not even expect a boyfriend to be so attentive and thoughtful this is by far the best service i have ever received from any establishment in my life and another reason that kyotofu is one of my favorite places in the city
wi still remember when i first met you it was late spring over a year ago i had just moved onto your block people were eating brunch outside on your front porch and i bumped into you in my gym shorts listening to my ipod one of your friends made fun of your ungainliness i thought you looked cute under your blue vshaped umbrellas we started passing by each other on the street youd tip your glass at me id wave back through my dry cleaning you were always busy really popularall the girls flocked to you once i mentioned a crafts project i was working on a corkboard you laughed at me and i felt silly later i found myself with two grocery bags of corks you had saved up from all of your partieswe went on a first date i was nervous and we were both tipsy you made lamb chops and lemon potatoes and we finished a few bottles of wine it was a warm night so we sat at the tables in your back terrace watching the people come and go talking of michelangeloyou called we flirted i played hard to get accidental runins were planned and id casually stop by for a drink i made sure never to stay too late and youd always walk me home around the corner you raved about your fine selection of winesbytheglass bourdeax blends and volkan the owner of your building who effectively built the place himself you were intriguing i lingered we spent the night in your wine cellar at the start of summer you asked me to go steady with you i wasnt sure if i was ready to be with someone who was such a fervent proponent of freerange chicken and grassfed beef but you were as sweet as your red velvet cupcakes and as quirky as your bacon beer i was quite beside myself dont ever change keep chopping the hot peppers and ill stir the shrimp on the stovelove n
no goes to angels shareangels share clearly does not need any more reviews most people love it including myself so ill leave you with specific itemsone my only quibble light poursthe cocktails are crafted very well but the pours are light on the booze expectations of a stiffer bigger pour might be a classic murican idea but for the prices charged i dont think its unreasonable to expect a decent pourthis is my only beef everything else was excellenttwo groups of four or lesssince most reviews say this if you dont know this you deserve to be shown the door its like walking in to milk honey which you shouldnt be able to but thats mhs fault and not knowing or feigning ignorance that they have a reservations policy cmon now if youre really into a nice cocktail do your homework a littlethree quick seating yes reallymy friend and i got there at pm on a holiday friday and were seated right away at a fourperson booth by the window i would like to think that my reputation for general awesomeness preceded me and that my stunning handsomeness sealed the deal but we all know that reality is opposite thatso despite my awkwardness we were still seated right awaywe were told that we may have to move to the bar or a twoperson spot later fine by me you can fold me into the coat rack for all i care so long as i can drinkso much to love about this seating arrangement a fourperson spot can be taken by two people if you just move the pair later when a foursome needs the table this way the table is utilized the pair is happy and the foursome gets their table later i can see this not working in a restaurant when seatings are for longer but in a cocktail spot its a great tacticfour daahoudif youre a brown spirits drinker get the daahoud the smokeunderinvertedglass is not just a neat trick it adds to the drink and makes it unique at first i was mildly annoyed that the bouquet of the spirit was replaced by the smoke but once i got used to it i felt like the smoke added to the cocktail see photofive no douchebagsthis was surprising considering my tendency towards being highly judgmental in my head of course eww look at the dress on her wtf take off your baseball cap jackass dont hate you know you do it too everyone i saw was there to enjoy a nice cocktail and not be showy or obnoxious you know what they say if you dont see any fill in the blank in a room youre the guy i hope that wasnt the case anyway it was a nice crowd it helps a lot that they have a nostanding policy more cocktail spots should do this employees only allows standing and so was packed to the gills when i went also had a really annoying crowd dont know if theres a connection there but i bet there is six its japanesewhen people say that its a japanese speakeasy dont be put off by ingredients like japanese whiskey sake and yuzu some reviewers say sake ick are you an idiot the japanese restaurant next door isnt an affectationsorry i know this is long but i have one more thing to add seven spoiler alert exactly where it isspeakeasytype spots are fun but are no longer secrets nyc will always have it secrets and places that are meant to be secret will remain so angels share has reviews so clearly the cats out of the bagwhen you enter village yokocho from the street take the stairs up stairs bend around to the left as soon as you reach the restaurant angels share is the unmarked door to your left the door opens to the back wall of the bar this makes sense as the bar windows front the second floor of the building ive seen a bunch of people talk about walking all the way through to the back of the restaurant wrong it might be funny to confuse the noobs but thats annoying to the people trying to eat and to the staff when they get asked yet again where angels share isso open the unmarked door walk in and a friendly waiter will help you out

review babyi hemmed and hawed over what to review for my until i recalled my recent haircut and color at laura braunstein problem solved all the more appropriate because laura is celebrating its month anniversary of opening if you check out my rating distribution you will see that i give very few five stars laura deserves it and more ive gotten a color cut and gloss deal at lb with two different stylists sadly i forget their names but honestly i feel like everyone there is excellent most recently i booked an appointment the same day when does that ever work out but a couple hours later the receptionist called and very apologetically asked if i could possibly come in earlier because one of the stylists had gone home sick i couldnt and my voice betrayed how sad i was because lord knows my roots were showing and i had no other free time last week i hung up dejected just a half hour later the receptionist called back saying that she had rearranged some other appointments and i could come in at my normal appointment time after all i was amazed where in new york do receptionists ever go out of their way like thateven better was the actual haircut and color both times my blonde highlights have come out beautifully brightening my whole face the women just seem excellently trained and did i mention that you get free wine or a cocktail with your cutfinally i highly recommend getting the gloss i am blessedcursed with thick and thickshafted hair which is basically always dry the curse part the gloss makes all of the difference especially after having angered my hair with all of those color chemicals i come away with silky beautiful hair whose texture seems improved even after several washes and the hair stylists are amazing with the blow dryer even though it explicitly says in the procedure description that a blow dry isnt included both times theyve styled my hair so that i walk out ready to hit the townok at this point im rambling but just a few final positive notes they dont push product win the prices are quite reasonable double win they give you both the beginning and end time of the procedure my hair color cut and gloss went from to sharp i was walking out the door at none of this three or four hours bullshit can you tell i love laura why cant all salons be this wonderful happy months lb

deep beneath the crust of the earth lies sakaguraan underground oasis of japanese awesomeness just be ready to answer three riddles and cross a rope bridge to get here but seriously pay close attention to the street address or youll wind up in either a the sushi place next door or b nowherean office buildingafter almost coming here with a fellow yelpelite i found myself with another hungry foodie also ready to partake in the tasty small plates offered at sakagura we split six selections between two of usika shiokara a small plate of sliced raw squid in a salty squid liver marinade although small this is still good to split as i would have probably found it too overwhelming in both salt and bitterness to down the entire thing myselfhiyayakko my friend chose this and ate most of it but i managed to have a couple of bites she really liked it but i was indifferent im not a big tofu fan to begin with so dont listen to me i did enjoy the crunch from the grated ginger and scallion flakes thoughsake oyako don this was a bit larger than the first two and one of my favorites fresh strips of salmon and salmon roe eggs with soy sauce was served over a halfsphere of sushi rice the salmon was delicious and soft and had nice stripesmarbling of the fat layers the miso soup that comes with this was unnecessary but definitely welcomed buta kakuni we ordered two of these and as others have described this stewed pork is meltinyourmouth delicious along with the salmon this was also a standout dish i highly recommend getting this especially since its small enough to squeeze in with other choiceskama roast slices of chilled duck wrapped scallion with basil sauce this was good but not as good as the others its also but a decent portion for the price onsen tamago sea urchin and soft boiled egg in cold soup this was delicious but definitely an acquired taste sea urchin is very soft even though this is a soup its still very splittable chunks are small enough without doing too much cuttingpiercingwith their exhaustive menu ill definitely be coming back again but im thrilled we managed to conquer some great land and seabased offerings on the menu service was friendly and expedient to boot and they also have a legendary saki menu although we stuck to beers
last year because out of laziness i wanted to go to a dentist close to my job i chose a random dentist in midtown and it was an enormous mistake he billed for two cleanings when he barely did one etc and all of his misleading positive reviews seem to have been written either by himself in disguise or by his friends familysince my insurance only covers two cleanings annually i had to wait an entire year in order to have another visit to a dentist thankfully there werent any emergenciesi did some extensive research and am extremely happy with the results this time around i was extremely impressed by my experience at wall street dentalalthough initially disappointedyet not at all surprisedby the fact that everything done during my horrible experience last year had to be redone i was incredibly relieved and comforted by the high level of professionalism thoroughness courtesy friendliness warmth and understanding by the receptionist the dental assistant and the actual dentist now thats what i call service is the first cliche that comes to mind but i mean it sincerely i wish i could go to the dentist more often is something i never imagined myself thinking but my experience here was so positive its truewhen i came back raving about how happy i was with my experience here my roommate said he couldnt wait to go too its rare to be this excited by the dentist but even after a few weeks of reflection and reconsideration the feeling remains strongyou should go to wall street dental and please tell them david lopez sent you

listen by all accounts hurricane sandy hours away from landfall has the potential to be a whopper of a storm while i feel very safe in my cozy and highlyelevated part of upper manhattan who is to say what will happen right flooding high winds debris everywhere this storm could be the end of days but if sandy is going to kill me at least i can go down happywith about five pounds of artisan cheese in my bellytucked away on bleecker just down the street from its mother cheese shop murrays cheese bar boasts lots of cozy seating and indeed an actual bar the tables were rustic nicely decorated with white and red napkins that made me feel i was at a farm table albeit a very fancy one surrounded by hipsters and european teens friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff were quick on their toes made very helpful suggestions about menu items and had halfempty water glasses refilled lickity splitthe menu consists of two sides salads sandwiches and main dishes on one with cheese and meats on the other cheeses are broken down into various categories fresh soft ripened washed rind semifirm firm and blue each cheese is described by its origin whether its pasteurized or not what animal the milk originates from and its key defining notes eg fruity creamy funky briny adam and i split a cheese flight of three cheeses they are picked by the cheesemonger and they will accommodate requests however we just said go for it we wanted to be surprised by whatever came out about five minutes later the cheesemonger came directly to our table with the cheeses their accompanying sides and a small and adorable white fabric bag filled with breads and crackers our first cheese was murrays cavemaster reserve hudson flower a pasteurized sheeps milk cheese crusted in herbs and served with a side of earl gray teasoaked edible flowers out second cheese was the twig farm soft wheel a raw goat and cows milk cheese served with a slightly spicy pickle relish damned if i can remember the name of the third cheese we got and too bad because it was my favorite it was parmaseanesque and served with a soaked and sweet figfor meals i ordered the classic melt a grilled cheese served with a small bowl of smoky tomato soup one the amount of cheese in the sandwich was overwhelming and i say that in the most complimentary way im not sure of the exact blend of cheeses used but let me say this i was able to scrap it out of my sandwich with a spoon it was melty almost lavalike just dripping out of my sandwich upon each bite this would be an item used in the finest food porn movie surely its bread was how a grilled cheese sandwichs bread should be thick white and buttery with a golden crunchy crust the soup was the absolutely perfect accompaniment to it with the unholy amounts of cheese i had just consumed im glad the bowl was relatively small it was fresh and tasty and cut down the strongness of the cheese when necessaryadam ordered the rarebit cheddar burger as we arrived at murrays the lovely couple to the right of me were chomping on burgers and before long adam was fixated in a stare towards their table we laughed and he apologized but he was wondering what they had ordered the woman had the special blue cheese burger while he gentleman ordered the rarebit burger he highly recommended it adam bought it adam was more than pleased by the time he got his burger not only did the new table to the right of us inquire as to what adam was eating but the table to the left did too id like to think the the original gentleman started an unknowing trend in what to order at murrays that night as for the burger it was perfectly plump the cheese sauce was was decadent and it was cooked perfectly with a delicious amount of grill char on the outsidefor drinks we went the cider route i was surprised by the sarasola cider a basque cider with a fermented kombuchalike flavor the color was muted and it was pretty flat not my cup of tea per se but despite that it was actually pleasant it counted the rest of my gastronomical experience well adam got the foggy ridge sweet stayman cider which was much sweeter more appley and fizzier we are already planning trips back assuming we survive sandys wrath if not consider this to be my final and grand manifesto
bring home the baconno really youll want to this is by far the number one reason why i am giving these guys an extra star this was the best bacon i have ever tasted in all of my years of dining out in ny you should not come here without ordering a side if you are a bacon lover the title doesnt lie you may want to order an extra side so you can bring home the bacon i had the pleasure of having the kale with eggs a bit on the pricey side if you consider i didnt have cheese and the cost of two eggs and kale i felt like they could have put more kale on the plate it just didnt seem that substantial but it was delicious my friend had the grits with some kind of muffin with gravy and their scrambled slow cooked eggs all of which i tried and all of which were delicious had i not ordered the bacon which was a sizable portion i would have been starving after only ordering the kale with eggsdate rating up scale strong suggestion leave your name at the front and walk around the neighborhood while you wait

when i drink fancy cocktails i like listening to jazz i went here for a drink with a few jazz lovers we wanted to have an enjoyable drink at a place that offered chill music this place delivered i really liked it i like that they make this place special and run with it they have white table clothes candles specialty cocktails and live jazz music this would be a great date place or a good place to really sit down and catch up with a few friendsthis place was not too loud or too crowded the service is great the drinks were strong and enjoyable the mood lighting made the place feel very intimate i am more of a pbr and shot of whiskey kinda girl but sometimes i like going somewhere a bit classier i would highly recommend this place
sure you can find many fancy pants french patisseries in the city where youre likely to spend close to on a butter croissant and up to for a small slice of cake while said french bakeries are a joy to taste and behold well sometimes youd just rather have an allamerican neighborhood bakery thats much more accessible and affordableinsert amys bread i have lived in hk for over years now and have to say that ive probably lived off this awesome little bakery i am in no way exaggerating when i say that i sometimes find myself here up to times a week whether its to pick up a loaf of fresh bread a salad for lunch or some sweet pastries and cookies for breakfast and dessert i have probably tried just about everything they have to offer by now so i guess its time i bumped it up to stars if not only for its consistency and reliability in the spirit of the july challenge though i shall focus on the sweets served at amys ie i will now rattle off a bunch of sweet things you must get here cinnamon challah knot almond brioche toast cinnamon crispy whole grain oat and nut scone zucchini carrot and walnut muffin carrot cake red velvet cake chocolate cherry roll glazed cinnamon twist sticky bun with pecans chocoholic stick low fat applesauce donut chocolate hazelnut biscotti cornmeal lime cookie kitchen sink cookieand those are just their regular goodies that are always on rotation amys also adds a changing lineup of different things depending on the season such as fluffy hot cross buns near easter lemon bars and pies during the spring and now some strawberry shortcake and strawberry muffins for the summer whats even better is that most of their pastries and dessert range from just under a buck to about this place may be bad for your waistline but it sure as hell is easy on the walletps my wonderful mothers name is amy damn if only she was such a phenomenal baker perhaps i wouldnt have moved out then
five plus stars i came here for the first time shortly before thanksgiving years ago i used to be a bartender and i used to have a fellow czechoslovakian customer who would stop here from time to time to buy trays and would bring me a plate of varenykys when he came in best customerregular ever and i never forgot themthe varenykys and yes thats what they are even though they put pierogi on the sign thats because most people dont know the difference varenyky is always boiled while pierogi is usually boiled then fried or baked this is not pertinent im just giving an fyi they are so light sweet and delicious sauteed in just the right amount of onion i drove in and picked up a full tray theyre only cents each how can you beat that while i waited i got a small cup of the borscht to my eastern european relatives chagrin i have never been a big fan of the beet but this was absolutely amazing maybe my grandmother was just a terrible cook after allthe hours are limited only weekends and its easy to walkpass right on by look for the big blue chiropractors awning this little place is worth it i cant even make these cheaper than what it costs to pick them up from a legit place and i dont just drive into manhattan for anything if youve seen my parallel parking you would know
jin ramen you have made my search for that mediumboiled egg a bit more fulfilled ever since i moved here an extra egg is in order for the next time i come herewhen it comes to ramen the broth and noodles are definitely important factors to decide whether i like the place or not more importantly the egg says it all for me i love my mediumboiled eggs to be somewhat oozing with goodness which jin ramen satisfied me for the first time in awhile too bad they only give you half of the eggfor appetizers my friend and i ordered the chicken karaage which was delicious and juicy it was sadly a small portion that came out with small pieces for but what can i expect out of ny nowhere has huge portions unless you pay big bucks for it i ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen which came with delicious fatty pork slices it was definitely way better than ippudo and for some reason jin ramen hit my spot more than totto that day maybe i was deprived of good food after staying up late for countless of hours due to my exams that weeki enjoyed the wooden decor of the ramen joint it was something that i did not expect in the middle of west harlem more like it should belong in astor place next to ippudo for competition pdont worry orenchi ramen my heart is still with you from across the country i will have you in about a month d
for my review grey lady nantucket comes to the lower east sidewith a prominently seafood inspired menu the grey lady hits a home run for those of you who dont know the grey lady is the nickname of nantucket because of the amount of fog around the island however theres nothing foggy about this new les restaurant as theyve hit the new england nautical theme on the head fresh daily oyster selections and an excellent lobster roll are the headliners but this place has a lot going for it excellent service a great bar space and killer drinks just to name a few the atmosphere is laid back yet very welcoming the ladies and i headed over here for a sunday funday brunch we had an urban daddy deal that scored us each a lobster roll and unlimited drinks sunday funday for sure the space has a big open feel to it with lots of light streaming in perfect for a sunday funday boozy brunchour waitress now our homegirl mary was the only server on brunch duty and still managed to do an excellent job keeping up with everyones requests and making sure we constantly had full cocktails in short she was amazing i promised her a shout out the oysters were excellent as was the fresh watermelon and feta salad that we split the lobster roll was unreal granted it is but there was so much lobster falling out of the fresh brioche roll that i had to eat some with a fork before i could dive into my first bite it also had minimal mayo a prerequisite for an excellent lroll another friend had the grilled cheese and was impressed they also have traditional egg and french toast selections for brunch as well id also love to come back for dinner sometime and check out the fresh fish selections all in all we had a lovely afternoon here leaving full and happy also pretty drunk thank you unlimited drink deal very cute bartenderside note one of these lovely ladies absolutely hates the les and trekked all the way over there from the uws for the first time in about years due to the prospect of this lobster roll and nantucketish scene the antiles friend is also very antimayo she even owns a no mayo tee shirt dont worry she didnt wear that to grey lady

this place is beautiful the steinway is beautiful imagine watching a live jazz band play on stage under the blue lights and you can see central park behind through the massive glass windows i enjoyed every second of my time herei would highly recommend making reservations in advance you can choose to sit either at the bar or at a table the table is better of course because you are much closer to the stage and everything good comes with a price tag you might have to share a table with random strangers since most people hold up to people i was unfortunate to have this random guy share my table with me he was busy scribbling notes throughout the whole concert i guess he might have to write a review for his homework also he refused to order anything from the menu at first not till the waitress told him there was a minimum he ordered a small pie and whenever he cut his pie with a knife the whole table shook because he was so violent i enjoyed a glass of harvest apple sangria it was delicious and had a generous amount of fruits in it considering the fact that its now apple harvest season this drink could not be more perfect there is also a course dinner for i dont know if the food is good its a good way to save time but i would much rather focus my energy on listening to good music than on working my way through a course meal the doors open before the start of the show i went min early but there was already a small line outside the door so go early also if you have a student id you will receive a discount i would also recommend checking out the after hours show i have not yet done so myself but it seems much cheaper and is great for those nights when youd rather relax and be classy instead of going to turtle bay and doing all sorts of things you will regret
wow dined here on their second night in operation came in with low expectations and was blown away lets start with the food its delish plain and simple inventive and unexpected at every turn and yet comforting at the same time take for example the lobster blt on brioche toast with homemade aioli never had a lobster blt like this and its now easily my favorite that bread is to die for same goes for the brooklyn lager clam chowder it was slightly on the salty side but still ohsogood presentation on everything is also topnotch lets not forget we eat with our eyes first rock salt decor on my clam chowder adorable curly fries to accompany the blt amazing in particular i love that practically everything is made in house oyster crackers yep cocktail sauce to accompany our giant prawns yep rocky road ice cream of course and yes those marshmallows do melt in your mouth literally everything here is fresh and homemademoving on to the service in its first week of operation i expected service to be down right horrendous it wasnt our waitress was lovely if slightly overattentive but id take too much attention over too little any day these are simple wrinkles that im sure the restaurant will have ironed out within a few weeks the point is everyone here from the bartender to the hostess to the wait staff and the owners everyone is ridiculously friendly they make lw feel like a cozy adorable west village neighborhood spot except right here in the middle of nomadfinally no review of lw is complete without mentioning the decor the owners did a fantastic job bringing new england maine charm to the space while still maintaining a hip new york feel the magnetic poetry on the walls is pure genius and makes for endless entertainment the overhead candles upon entry are adorable the pops of red and the button bar stools add just the right amount of whimsy overall i loved it a much needed addition to the restaurant scene in this area and one of too few really good oyster joints in the city will be back frequently even if i didnt live blocks away

when jungsik first opened in new york named for mr jung sik yim and a play on korean for fine dining it was both appreciated and lampooned the decision to price its tasting menu at the level of emp was derided as unreasonably bold but the major reviewers noted that mr yims cooking was not as far off from that mark as one might expect of an upstart having had several months since then to further develop the dishes and incorporate the major critiques leveled against his endeavor i was eager to see the extent to which he had adaptedmost notably the three and five course menus were gone much to the shock of the women dining to the left of tiffany s and i they were instead replaced with an a la carte selection which in my opinion seemed something of a fools errand the prices seemed a touch too steep so attempting to pick a mere one or two exciting dishes would be akin to buying a third of a box of macarons at fourfifths of the price as such the two of us opted for the tasting menu i mentioned my shellfish allergies and was given a stunningly generous list of substitutes to choose from as we confirmed our intentions with our waiter the general manager jin ahn welcomed us sincerely apologizing at the cancellation of our earlier reservation due to the storm and graciously and unnecessarily offering us champagne on the house in a sign of the flawless service to come our amuse swiftly followed the pouring of the champagne a sesame rice chip a potato puree a cold gel of chicken stock and a smoked tofu tower which in turn begat bulgogi sliders with the final amuse being mr yims take on korean fried chicken were placed delicately before us if it sounds overwhelming it was not that the excitement of the kitchen should be chastised as it served to showcase some of the textural nuances and truly creative flavor combinations we were in for sadly the bulgogi sliders served more to lull us to sleep and were underwhelming before our first true courses the sommelier kyungmoon kim asked if wed like to see a wine list and at telling him that wed be partaking in the wine pairing grew visibly excited hurrying though not unbecomingly to procure our first bottle in the meantime our first course arrived tiffany received a silky clam chowder and i a rich buttery chestnut soup along with sumptuous earl grey infused bread made inhouse as mr kim returned we were given detailed but interesting rationales behind our selections of wines a pattern that continued appreciably throughout our meal the wines that we had the pleasure of being served were all matched to our food immaculately my substitutions included mr kim has compiled an incredible list and has gone to great lengths to alternately balance and enrich mr yims cuisine what followed our soups was a foie gras with an apple gelee that left the two of us bewildered what a simple idea for needed acidity and what wonderful execution execution which was rivaled in the fantastic wagyu tartare with its interplay of somehow opulent egg yolk and firm savory beef my mushroom dish submerged under a beautifully poached egg and parmesan crisp sung of dashi kimchi and umami the octopus in ssamjang aioli was tender perfection and with the slightest hint of salinity the bossam that followed was the opposite extreme nearly disturbingly crunchy but equally delicious interspersed with lettuce and negi though thankfully forgoing the clumsy wrap structure though my classic fish was a fine take on black cod in a moat of smoked red pepper i much preferred my partners snapper sitting in a bed of cilantro and jalapeno puree though i couldnt enjoy the clam broth below the scales had been left on and fried in oil leaving them delightfully crisp the kimchi steak jus sadly had a bit too much heat for the wagyu and was the first and only true miss of the night for my palate in a meal of so many dishes that is quite a showing the desserts quickly redeemed the minor misstep with the omija granite serving as a perfect palate cleanser before the stunningly rich pumpkin cheesecake the artfulness of the plating of jonghun wong should be commended crystalline leaves evoke fall as successfully as the pumpkin cheesecake itselfin truth though it be high praise jungsik provided one of the finest meals ive had the pleasure of enjoying along with that the staff are truly exemplary to a woman it has truly earned its michelin star and i felt a creeping sadness at the halfempty dining room in an era where a michelin star does not have the cachet it once did given some of its more questionable recipientsrouge tomate nor does it ensure continued successpicholine word of mouth once more returns to the forefront of generating excitement in fine dining i cannot urge you any more vociferously to go to jungsik there are extraordinarily few restaurants more deserving of your time and attention
hi hello and resounding yes its the only way i can think of starting this reviewif i were the designer of my own afterlife i might have found my architectural blueprint for the chicken finger lover in everyone this place is as close to heaven on earth as youll find the actual joint is not so large inside so mayybe be prepared to take your order to go luckily my friend and i went on a rainy evening so we basically had the whole place to ourselves super friendly staff that offered great recommendations and were genuinely curious to know how our food was lets break it downgeneral sticky tso fingers with thai sweet chili sauce amazingly delicious a favesalted caramel pretzel fingers with stickys sauce and classic bbq sooo good if a little tough to cut through with plastic utensilstruffle fries excellent though as others have pointed out they dont skimp on the truffle oilsweet potato fries basically candywe only ordered fingers with each entree and still it was too much food this is a great place to split items especially the sides since they are very generous helpingseverything was so good that i cant help but want to try all of them and because these are rather artisanal fingers the guilt just never surfaces not that i ever feel guilty ordering a chicken fingersupport this joint its great and if you ever need a chicken finger buddy well call me
i think this is the only worthwhile pork belly in manhattan usually i make the hour trip from brooklyn to flushing to get my fix this isnt quite as good as hahm ji bak in flushing very close though but for some reason it is better than the han joo in flushing i think its the service hopefully it wasnt just because they just opened and they maintain that level of customer care the pork belly probably tastes better at this location because the waitress was very attentive and made sure it was cooked perfectly she was also diligent about replenishing all the side disheswith a generous tip it came to for a big satisfying well rounded meal we didnt get any alcohol though overall not bad i also really appreciate it when restaurants dont try to tack on extra charges barley tea rice unlimited side dishes multiple dipping sauces etc are all included this is how it should be i was there on their second night open and already they had a good number of customers i have a feeling it may be hard to get a seat soon on a friday night i know ill be a regular and so will a lot of my friends
ave deli is probably the best most consistent jewish deli ive been to born out of the ashes of the famous original from the east village by a younger member of the family that has taken over this place continues to churn out great classic easterneuropean jewish cuisine the setup is a little odd as they have the counter in the front and the rest of the dining room is split in half and separated by panels i dont know why they do this as its very weird and confining for privacy perhaps service can eithet be efficient if impersonable or freaking hilarious depending on who you get if you get one of the old jews theyre awesome this is all ill say the owner is usually hanging around in the front as well so say hi but as much as the culture of the deli is interesting the food is the reason we comeeverytime i come here i get a pastrami sandwich which is probably the best ive had it can vary a bit based on visit but not by much it is aromatic meaty peppery and delicately fatty all at once they also dont skimp on the meat like most jewish delis the rye bread also stands out from the normal cardboardish variety and they may make it themselves ive gotten the matzoh ball soup on occasion and it is also among the best ive had the broth is subtle and filled with ample schmaltz while the ball itself is soft buttery and delcious without dominating the bowl the pickles pickled tomatoes and cole slaw they bring is all good as well as a valueadd in particular the pickles are so good that i even eat the half sours the meal is finished with a shot of a malty chocolate beverage a sort of kosher egg cream which some are wild about some hate and i just enjoy its a good cap to the meal and something that they really dont have to offer a meal from here with a black cherry dr browns is one of the most satisfying meals i can imagine as someone who is jewish but did not grow up religious or even liking the food really that is a bizarre statement i never thought id make sure it is expensive but you also get what you pay for there is a reason david sax framed his study of jewish delissave the deliaround his experiences here ave deli is the real deal and if you dont like it then feel free to go to go one of the many tourist trap delis instead more room for me and my everexpanding girth

believe it or not i normally dont even like pasta and would typically would never choose to eat it however the one exception is japanese pasta it was one of the things i loved to eat the most when i went to visit japan it was always perfectly chewy not too heavy on the sauce tasty and altogether delightful i first heard about basta pasta from a coworker when i was talking about how much i missed japanese pasta ive been dying to try it ever since and i finally made it out there this weekend i went with three of my friends from out of town for dinner the ambiance was great simple fresh clean white the kitchen is basically an open area in the middle of the restaurant which i really appreciatedbasing my decision off of the yelp reviews i shared the sea urchin and the spaghetti con prosciutto e parmigiano with a friend both were delicious and i have trouble deciding which one i liked more though i think the uni was more unique the first was the perfect combination of very fresh delicious uni and tomato i also loved the parmesan and prosciutto combination it is prepared in a large bowl of parmesan right in front of the table my friend from japan who i would believe to be the expert in all things japanese pasta actually said this is the best pasta shes had in her lifehighlight of the meali was so ecstatic about eating this amazing pasta that i happily declared i am so happyit feels like there are explosions of happiness bursting inside of me we all paused for a beat and then burst out laughing while i attempted to hide my horrified face i am slightly embarrassed to share this publicly but i promised my friends i would include this in my review haha to summarize this pasta is absolutely amazing and heaven sent anyone who gives this place anything under stars needs to literally get their heads bashed into a wall and checked into a mental institution because they would be crazy to think otherwiseyou must try it and see what i mean about the fireworks of joy
having eaten at masa neta definitely made me reminisce of that time i had the tasting they have a a option which is less exotic that has courses by the end you have very happily filled stomach you can see photos of all courses posted on yelp so i wont get into all of them but the main highlightscocktail glass with toro and caviar this is supposedly on the menu for but you get it as part of the tasting they give you warm bread on the side to eat with it i ate all the bread which was sad bc i really wanted to stick my tongue into the glass to lick the remaining toro and caviar but clearly this wouldnt have looked the best in such a nice placetoro sushi slightly darker pink color in fact what is great about all the sushi is how perfectly balanced they have the amount of rice to sushi you dont feel as though either side is lacking or too much also they have a nice wet napkin in a small dish for you to cleanse your fingers after eating each they encourage you to eat with your fingersthe cocktails drinks are pricey and you dont get too much to be honest i would have skipped this and just had water as the food has enough flavor on its owndefinitely must go to place ps they apparently do serve blowfish to their regulars i didnt realize this else i would have requested to add that to my meal
lillies is pretty much what youd see if you entered the special corners of my brain its decorated elegantly the ceilings are high the windows are pieces of artwork and the drinks are strong as helli love the detail in the surroundings i know its mostly about the food and drink but there is something to be said in the old school classful feel of this place no shiny modern plastic here the sitting area towards the back of the place is elevated i looked like a melting slug getting in and out of these seats mostly because i was pretty tips and i am pretty shortscome to think of it i actually like that you can be seated and at a face to face almost level with friends servers and the managers who actually continue to check up on you danielle the night manager when i went was great friendly and attentive the manager working before her i think her name was lynn even checked in on the tables before her shift ended the ambiance and service of lillies is a lost artthe drinks were strong which means perfect and delicious well worth your hard earned dollars the food was surprising good also i always thought it was just a bar meaning a pit stop before the restaurant but there were a good number of tables who were obviously there for the food food crowdsseats in the rear the bar and the noise up front i appreciated the divisionits located super close to times square which admittingly is slightly cringeworthy except everyone works in midtown suck it up cause once you get here you wont feel like youre drinking off broadwaycant wait to go back and am very seriously considering a potential birthday event in the smaller downtown one this summer

my friends and i were regulars at the old location in soho we used to go at least once a week we were completely devastated when they closed and were moving to midtown i passed by this location the other day and couldnt wait to try it we miss our old usual spotlast night my friend nat and i finally made it for dinner we could barely contain our excitement the space at this location is a lot more roomier and has a nice modern look to it the decor is really cool with the lit up cases on the side wall and a large bar area this is definitely a larger space than downtown and can accommodate a much larger crowd we were immediately greeted by the hostess and some familiar faces from the old location to our surprise the manager came over to us and said he recognized us and was so glad to see some old regulars before we got the menu we already knew what we wanted to order after ordering up a round of red sangria one of our favorites the papas bravas was definitely our first choice this is small fried potatoes served with different dipping sauces be careful when you eat this as they do make it fresh and it is very hot when you first get it we also got the meatballs and oxtail with truffle oil mashed potato in red wine sauce the oxtail surprised us the most because it was something new we were trying this was such an amazingly delicious dish we cannot wait to come back and have it again coming here was a delight and we are glad to say that lizarran hasnt lost anything about itself from the old location but rather upgraded into something more modern and awesome always great food and great service im excited to come back next time im in midtown

i stopped by for a drink on saturday afternoon and loved sitting at the bar with some wine loved it so much we went to dinner last night and ate properly at the table so it might sound a bit but i did learn about isola via a daily candy email italian my boyfriends favorite soho steps away it was onthe martini i ordered was delicious the very brunchy bellini my boyfriend ordered was to sweet for me but he enjoyed it very muchwe had the small meat and cheese plate which was pretty phenomenal truffle lard is the new black in my book that is all the cheeses were fantastic the salumi had just enough spice and enough fat what was absolutely surreal were the toast points i heard angels sighing with each bite i took octopus bites perfect bites warmroom temperature deliciousness ok i changed my mind to die forbeet salad i wish the red beets were sliced thinner god how messed up of me on second thought no i dont i do wish there was goat cheese there ok there i had the agnolotti filled with sweet corn with mushrooms on top they were only the most amazing agnolotti i ever had in this country i wish the portion was times bigger i just wanted to keep eating them until i got sick perfection my boyfriend had the bucatini and left all the peas on his plate he hates peas and i find it hilarious as the guy can eat anything his bucatini with fennel sausage and jumbo lump crab meat was beyond beyond i tell you we did not have dessert but we will next time because there will be next time very soon because i have to try the pizza rose was great service fantastic our waiter had great recommendations and couldnt have been nicer and more attentive decor is just right too the place is expensive yep i said it
going to agra is kind of like visiting a speakeasy despite a relatively large awning and being able to see the second floor restaurant through windows across the street the actual entrance is not immediately transparent instead you go up to the door and its a residential building you hit the second floor buzzer and the restaurant rings you in no password required however but it still has an air of mystery about it in a fun waythe interior of agra is designed to take you to another world wood floors red everywhere paintings some nice moldings and dim but not dark lighting all help transport you away from the bustling city outside the staff is super friendly and welcomes you with proverbial open arms though i was new to this place i felt like i was coming over to a friends housea bit of perspective i grew up living downstairs from an indian family that would frequently babysit me so from the age of i was already eating home style indian food so my tastes were determined very early on for such cuisine i find most indian places in nyc disappointing but every now and then you find a gem and agra counts as one to the foodliver poori mildly spiced chicken liver cooked with chopped onionsi know i knowew liver some people will say but i grew up eating chicken gizzards so liver is just a part of the bird to me not something to be tossed away for those who are squeamish dont bother with this dish for those into livers and those sorts of meats this is a delicious treat the liver is super tender and has a great texture the onion sauce it sits in is heavenly and it is served with a piece of fried bread that is crisp and tasty the entire dish is very rich so while not large it will definitely satisfychana shag chickpeas cooked in a mild spinach saucechana shag is one of the more dependable dishes ive rarely had a bad one but when it is bad its usually because its too dry or salty in this case the term mild is correct the flavor is very mellow and doesnt overwhelm anything else youre having while it is an entree i think the flavor lends itself to being a side a bit more the texture was perfect with the spinach being creamy and the chick peas being delicate but still having bitechicken tandoori chicken on the bone marinated and seasoned in herbs and spices grilled in clay ovenprobably one of the best things you can have in an indian restaurant when watching your weight this chicken was absolutely delicious and served on a hot iron plate still sizzling bits of fat left on the sides were practically attached to the plate as you peeled its awesomeness off the chicken was flavorful juicy tender and the meat peeled right off the bone with a fork this isnt always the case with this dish which more often than not winds up too dry so i was very impressedgarlic nan nan layered with garlic and spicesone of my favorite add ons to any indian meal the nan here is a bit crisp on the outside and soft on the inside the garlic on top is really nice and there isnt an excessive amount of oil weighing it down as ive had in other restaurants the garlic flavor isnt overwhelming either rather its just right and enhances the flavor of any food you have with itkashmir nan nan layered with raisins almonds and coconut gritsto clarify coconut grits does not refer to southern styled grits with coconut flavor instead this is almost like a dessert nan the nan is the same as the garlic nan but instead of garlic its topped with the sweet ingredients mentioned above including toasted coconut shreds it was heavenly and actually would have made a fine dessert on its own this was a new one to me so im really happy it came out so wellgulam jamun deep fried cottage cheese rounded dipped in rum syrupmost of the time restaurants serve smaller dumpling sized gulam jamun as a dessert not so here instead you get one large one probably about the size of from another restaurant and it sits in a tasty hot syrup this dessert is an exercise in flavor and textures the fried cheese portion is a light airy item with a wonderful chew to it its very soft and practically melts in your mouth this is helped by the hot syrup it sits in i actually recommend letting it cool for a minute or so when you get it which permeates every inch of the cheese absolutely one of my favorite dessertsagra is one of my favorite indian places in the city now and i enjoy its rather mysterious location shout outs to tom k and tricia k for introducing me to this place

luxe entertainment filledgreat for groups party minded patronshad a blast here with friends for a late brunch came just in time to see a burlesque show meal was fantastic delicious well fleet oysters awesome wine and everyone elses dishes were great as well the burlesque show was pretty loud definitely not a place you bring someone who is not in the mood to dance everyone got up at the end of the showmeal and started dancing in the restaurant definitely a party and far from mellow sceney scene ran into a bunch of friends i had not seen for yearsdate rating up scale strong suggestion come with friends when youre in a silly mood and want to have a noisy uplifting party type meal

just as soon as i stopped swooning about their downtown locationthis happened a drybar opened in the parker meridien and yes their hours are do you know what this means i can get a blow out and still make it to work by so when friday rolls around and i want awesome hair to kick my weekend off right you know im trolling their app for an appointment the subterranean space is a tad small and while it can feel claustrophobic without any windows and sunshine i dont think any of that matters when you walk in bright and early and someone offers you a coffee and coiffure just like its first nyc location downtown the atmosphere is cheery with framed mirrors yellow and gray accentsmercy me i have to say the stylists in this location seem to be a bit more on their agame than downtown as well they always do my hair perfectly and for the most part it stays all day and lets all be honest for a minutewhen you have a fabulous blow out dont you just walk around like you are hot stufflets not forget that drybar boasts a blow out so i can actually afford to go plus i dont mind forking over my money to the friendly staff who keep my credit card on file so the entire thing is super fast and easywhich is especially important to get to work on time all the while looking fantastic if you havent been to the drybar at all then you probably have bad hair sorry but someone had to tell you if you havent been to the one in midtown please dont become a patron because its hard enough getting an appointment as it is and if the owner alli is reading this please please please open another location preferably on the upper east side street could really use you ive said it before and ill say it again blowdry bar win

review update in the spirit of the month of july yelp challenge summer sweet treatsfor the purpose of the july challenge i will just cut to the chase and talk about the dessert i had at lartusi the other night on july i had already fallen in love with the desserts here the first time i visited when i had the dulce de leche panna cotta with bruleed bananas and a chocolate hazelnut tort so of course i knew just how imperative it was to order dessert again in fact im sure its a no brainer to get dessert during every single visit go big or go home rightanyway so the dessert i want to talk about here is the raspberry tiramisu this beautiful triflelike dessert was layered with smooth sweet raspberry mousse raspberry liquor infused lady fingers and fresh whipped cream studded with market fresh raspberries while the traditional tiramisu has always been one of my favorite italian desserts i thoroughly enjoyed this twist on the espressoflavored dessert and the bf liked it a lot too because hes not a fan of anything coffee related the mousse was perfect in texture and bold in flavor which was well balanced by the delicate whipped cream and soft lady fingers the entire thing came together well and actually wasnt too sweet which i really appreciated i also appreciate that the dessert menu at lartusi always changes through the seasons as i love nothing more than a seasonally focused menu that utilizes market ingredients the dainty little raspberries in this tiramisu was exactly what youd look for in a summer treat for a picture of the dessert as always the service here is topnotch and the ambiance super classy for the sake of the july challenge id suggest just popping in for a seat at the bar to enjoy some wine a light bite and some of their beautifullyexecuted desserts
i came here for a girls night after work i actually really liked this place it isnt too loud it isnt too crowded it isnt too empty and it isnt too expensive in all major aspects this place was just rightthey have a nice lay out great atmosphere classy yet comfortable vibe and an outdoor patio i am a big fan of outdoor patios so to me this was a huge perkthis would be a perfect place to have a first date we counted of them happening while we were there the mood lighting is nice and the crowd is more young adult instead of college kids good drink menu fast service and chill place i would go back i would also highly recommend this place for a date
i came for the ramen but i found much much more im a ramen nut so when i heard about their beef trifecta noodles i just had to give it a whirli dropped by on an early sunday evening with a few friends and was seated quickly without a reservation i was expecting the typical cramped japanese noodle bar but stumbled into a restaurant with a lot of tables and a full bar score i totally dig the decorit took me a second to orient myself but i knew i was in for something different the appetizers menu read like a chinese dim sum menu but with a twist why just have ordinary shao mei when you can have truffle oil shao mei regular shrimp dumplings or white jade bunny shrimp dumplings regular beef dumplings or steak provolone cheese pan fried dumplings were in the west village and witnessing some sort of asian dim sum enlightenment here shoot you can even get your fix of crab meat soup dumplings at niu are you following me i came for the ramen but here i am raving about the appz my suggestion is to come in even number groups so you can share these dishes evenly my fave is probably the pan fried flank steak provolone cheese dumplings with the truffle shai mei coming in a close second but im not done i came for the beef trifecta noodle soup did i not this is a fantastic bowl of noodles that includes flank steak short ribs beef shank with your choice of noodle and soup base you can choose between different types of noodles and different soup bases thats combinations i think i went with the egg noodle and spicy niu special soup which was ridiculously good first off they have this cute little chopstickgreen onion holder in the shape of their cow logo hanging on the bowl the darn thing is so friggin cute love details much theres also this awesome wasabi flavored seaweed tempura on top of the noodles which i wished they would serve as an app or complimentary community dish the beef was delishlike they came off a kbbq grill the broth was savory with that noticeable but not overbearing spice kick and the noodles i didnt know this beforehandbut found out that these niu noodles are hand made daily bounce bounce in yo mouth yo i said im not doneim pretty full right about now but the waiter chris was recommending their shaved ice dessert if youve ever had woolys or any taiwanese shaved ice you know you cant resist this light and fluffy dessert what the hell i took the leap and ordered the mango flavored shaved ice this was probably one of the best endings to a great meal im thinking they can probably sell thousands of this dessert in a separate operation altogether why hide it tucked away on the bottom of a dessert menu get this ok i think i covered everything now im done
best barber shop of all time of all time i recently moved to the columbus circle area and needed a new barber shop and boy did i find it this place is old school after your cut they give you a clean razor shave on the sides and back no matter how many people are waiting the staff is a mixture of old school guys and new school kids you will only find real new yorkers cutting hair here and for the most part the same goes for the clientele i am here every friday to get fresh for the weekend a haircut is vital to a mans confidence ever since i found this place i see ryan gosling when i look at myself in the mirrorcorrection i think i look better than ryan gosling after finding this place
two reviews in one restaurant week and then the omakase dining restaurant week i had my first morimoto experience when i came here for lunch with two friends i knew that the food wouldnt be the best that morimoto had to offer but i was still interested to see what kind of fare we would get among the three of us we got the braised black cod and the wagyu beef the lunch was served bento box style each bento box came with the following miso soup which had huge pieces of tofu in it salad pieces of sashimi pieces of sushi with white ginger vegetable tempura asparagus and scallion with a cheese based dipping sauce for it was not a bad deal at all the best part of the meal was the dessert the green tea panna cotta was freaking delicious i think the dessert is what cemented my decision to return for omakase i came back a few weeks later for dinner we decided to go with the omakase menu which is an extremely common practice in japan basically in japan you pull up a seat and your entire menu is up to the chef but in japan you can pay whatever you think your meal was worth whereas you cant get away with that here the omakase menu usually goes from lighter to heavier fare for example we started with some raw selections and worked our way up to the with surf and turf finally ending with dessertin my opinion the omakase is totally worth the price and if you want the fullest dining experience at morimotos you need to get it its per person the chef included items that i would have never thought to order on my own such as the oyster with foie gras it was one of my favorite dishes that night i saw some people ordering omakase for the entire table no no thats just awkward this is a course menu each plate is going to have small servings plus it doesnt make sense to split a piece of sushi wayslastly you need to use the bathroom there just go even if you dont have to go the toilets are badays and are heated i would totally stop by in the middle of winter just to warm up my patoot
do you ever wish you could go to a place with delicious dinner food creative cocktails and actually interesting desserts do you find yourself looking for places where the server doesnt stiffen when everyone shares everything i hate that stop judging us do you secretly wish yelp has an option for popular places with good ambiance where they wont rush you to leave so you can actually enjoy the mealthis is that placeperfect for a girls night out or date night kyotofu could not have impressed me more from our croquette appetizers to the light and mildly spicy mac and cheese to the pomegranate mojito happy hour until to the chefs choice three course dessert menu the yuzu tofu cheesecake and signature sweet tofu were highlights disappointed by the green tea creme br√ªl√©e our meal was made to perfection our lovely server even brought out a separate mochi chocolate cake and pear ginger sorbet amazing to sing to the birthday girl how sweetwith the yelp checkin ny mags best gluten free cupcakes happy hour birthday desserts we saved more than off the bill and the entire time our server was a doll she was gracious patient attentive and so accommodatingi almost didnt want to leave even though we ate so much i was really full the food was so light that i felt like i could eat the night away dangerousanyways i miss you already kyotofu im coming back soon like tmrw

i know that i should eat a bit more of a cleaner diet and sometimes i get the urge to try out going veganvegetarian but the meat eater in me is in a constant battle with that thinking its like i have a devil sitting on one shoulder and an angel on the other constantly at odds well at least for one night the angel woncafe blossom made me totally think that i could actually enjoy the organic vegan lifestyle too bad i could never really cook the delicious plates that i tasted last nightseriously everything that we ordered last night was tremendous and tasted wonderful at times i look at vegan food to be a bit bland but the menu here is quite eclectic and full of intense aromas and flavor even the setting with its subdued red walls quiet music and candle lit atmosphere offers an ambiance catering to an enjoyable relaxing meal exploring the vegan landscape looking over the menu we wanted to try everything alas we had to settle for a only a few things our waitress penelope was super sweet and friendly and offered some perfect suggestions for our first meal here she suggested some drinks and we started off with the strawberry berry sangria which was refreshingly intense and filled with blueberries too as an appetizer we chose the chickpea fritters with sauteed ratatouille this was totally not what i thought it would be and had a creamy consistency with a light crispy outside as there were three pieces we had to fight over who got more the main plates both terrific and totally different seitan marsala with sage potato cake saut√©ed garlic spinach poached pear shallot and thyme marsala reduction saut√©ed mushroom risotto with scallion miso mustard cashew cream fried leek carrot and cilantro holy taste bud assault the seitan had an intense smokey flavor to it and everything on the plate complimented it perfectly it makes you forget about eating meat or poultry as this is in a category all its own plus such a large amount is served on the plate that there is no skimping here the risotto was creamy and rich full of mushrooms and bold flavor even though this is quite a filling bowl i could not stop eating it and actually had to finally give up as sides we had the sauteed asparagus with lemon and grilled corn with a chipotle style sauce both were just a perfect accompaniment to the overall meal which was fabulousseriously we were stuffed after this and could not even make room for dessert will have to go back as we saw some people near us raving about it i must also note that the plating presentation is a joy to the eyes plates that are made of slate bowls that have a futuristic look and wine bottles on the table holding water the location itself is a chic bistro with a very warm feel but totally representative for this part of town in the west village candles everywhere they also have a full bar with some organic beer and wines to choose from there is even a whole downstairs room that would be perfect for private parties and group dining affairs even the bathrooms are clean and elegant with a coed sink area in between them what more can i say this was a flawless meal the food choices are totally vegan with a unique flair and prepared perfectly you pay a little extra for expertly made vegan fare and this is totally worth it from the attentive service to the stylish yet simple surroundings to the fantastic food selections cafe blossom is a joy to the palate and a must visit for those who enjoy the vegan lifestyle or just looking to take a walk on the meatless side for a while
i may have fallen in love let me tell you the object of my affection is sexy as hell nope not a new man in my life but a fabulous jazz lounge in tribeca my mom was in town for the weekend and i wanted to take her somewhere special somewhere swanky and somewhere we could get dressed up and really feel like we were having a new york night out on the town silver lining fit the bill perfectly everyone we were greeted by and waited on could not have been nicer or more accommodating they showed us over to the best table in the house as the jazz trio was getting ready to start their set the space itself is larger than i thought it would be with tiny tables for two in front of the band area or up on a balcony if you want to be able to have more of a conversation there are booths in the back for larger groups and a great bar area as well that id happily grab a drink at however i do think silver lining would be best for a date when you want to impress somebody gentlemen take note our server louis was fantastic he made us laugh and had great recommendations mom and i never even looked at a cocktail menu just told him what our favorite spirits are which resulted in a wonderfully citrus lemon vodka drink for mom and an amazing ginger bourbon beverage for me the cocktails were absolutely fabulous and came with a metal stirring straw and large singular ice cube now who doesnt love that we ended up ordering some snacks as well and i can assure you the food is just as tasty as the cocktails we got two orders of sliders the lamb and the veggie they will also accommodate you so you can also mix and match them in an order both were great the lamb one was possibly the best lamb burger ive ever had in nyc to top it all off the music is just as good as the drinks and food we sat back and listened to the jazz sipped our cocktails and just let all of our troubles melt away i really dont see how anyone could have a bad night at silver lining or leave feeling anything other than total bliss and infatuation put this place on your list pronto

borgattis you dastardly rogue youve ruined me for other ravioli foreverseriously these guys have been making pasta the same way for years and its pretty clear that they have it down pat the place gets pretty crowded with italian nonnas and other people who are also passionate about food so dont be shy about flagging down one of the superhelpful staffthere are two types of ravoili available ricotta cheese and meat spinach prices are super reasonable and the ravioli are perfect with any preparation i particularly enjoyed the meat spinach in a simple beef broth the ricotta cheese ravioli were even perfect plain the cooking process was very easy simply boil gently for minutesparting thought im trying the squid ink pasta next time
they treated me like royalty and family for my birthdayangel and gio were very accommodating in helping me figure out how i wanted to organize my ever growing dinner party size i had reservations for a party of and we walked in and were all immediately seated yerba buena is such a cute and cozy intimate dinning space so you cant help but to feel like family the wait staff were all wonderful jose was a gentleman and very patient with taking all of our drink appetizers and dinner orders i ordered the hemingway drink and boy oh boy it was pretty delicious some of my guest even said their cocktails were pretty strong i love a restaurant that doesnt hold back on the cocktails we had such a large party so we ordered servings of the corn and spinach filled empandas guacamole beef sliders and the sesame seed drizzled fried calamari absolutely amazing i ordered the lechon for my meal and could hardly finish it all by myself the rice was well cooked and seasoned and i love love love love yes quad love any meal that has a side of maduros for dessert they brought out samplers and we all shared plates of churros pastel de chocolate fondue and my personal favorite tres lechesthe restaurant was full of birthdays and we all joined in with the staff congratulating the other patrons on their big dayi will definitely be back for another great meal
perfect place for a dinner with a loved one or to catch up with your friends theres a front bar with a few seats if you dont want to wait to eat at a table while theres a back room for proper seatings i also hear theres a back room where it gets even more intimate which i have not had the chance to check out quite yet its been awhile since i have given a restaurant stars and uva sure deserves it on my end they accept reservations whether by phone or by opentable so make sure you call in if you plan on going on a busy day this was my first meal welcoming me to nyc as a new resident in my new area and i loved it speck delicious and ever so tender smoked prosciutto plate warning these portions are more than enough to share between people we were not warned for our party of and ended up ordering too much see below coppa so tender that it felt like it was melting in your mouth definite choices of cheese comes with grapes and honey to drizzle on your cheese cavatelli al pesto pasta shells shaved with ricotta cheese i absolutely loved this dish it wasnt too rich and the pesto sauce was absolutely to die for i felt like they added crack in there because i was not able to stop eating because of this dish it made me want to go back and try out their other pasta ricotta cheese black truffle honey oil bruschetta this was pretty good for a start but i didnt think it was absolutely amazing and to die for like what everyone else says absolute recommendation and better yet this gem of a place is right down the street from my apt wooohooi will be a regular soon
seasonal is underrated there is barely any hype about this place yet it has been open since to our surprise my fiance and i had one of the most creative fun and tasty meals everwe opted for the course tasting which is a bargain at the chef started us out with a beautiful and elegant cucumber amuse bouche next we were treated to a cucumber gazpacho with a pastrami artic char centerpiece it was fresh and light on the palate sweetbreads with grilled watermelon cubes was our next course the chef used a clever watermelon juice based sauce to finish the dish who knew watermelon juice would be used in a savory sauce our third course was probably the best poached egg and lobster under a covering of hen of the woods mushrooms finished with pumpernickel foam the textures of the hen of the mushrooms airy foam and soft poached egg formed the perfect threesome my final savory course consisted of just three ingredients filet mignon carrots and peas but the presentation was unlike anything ive ever seen the carrots and the peas were set up to look like an alice and wonderland landscape a one inch wide six inch across layer of peas puree was the base for a mini jungle of carrots and peas shoots my words wont do it justice take a look at my pictures to see the amazing artistry dessert was a trio of sorbets and fresh fruit over a line of rice pudding a light but perfect end to the mealwolfgang ban and eduard frauneder are doing some amazing work in midtown the dishes were very modern and made me think about food in new ways ive never been treated to such beautiful art on a plate per the seasonal website ban and frauneders goal is to provide elegant homecooking in a sleek but welcoming setting they have succeeded in doing that now its time to get the word out

the toucan the lion you have done mara proud shes actually doing very well herself in long islandthis sibling dinner with me and michelle w had taken at least a month of planning to accommodate both our busy schedules the main catalyst for us to make this trip down to east village was the scoutmob max coupon we arrived for our reservations and were seated in the empty restaurant by the time we left the dining room was packed so i highly recommend calling ahead for reservationswe started off with the scotch eggs and how could you not the different textures from the crispy duck sausage to the gooey egg yolk played wonderfully off each other each egg was about the half size of a babys fist which was extremely generous of the restaurant our eggs were followed by duck confit mofongo again the restaurant dazzled us with two simple ingredients eggs and duck meat michelle educated me on the puerto rican heritage of mofongos but our dish was asiatic in nature with lap chang chinese sausage and a taro mash our mains were on deck and i was completely blown away first the lesser of the two the goat pot pie so simple in design yet elegant in execution it was basically braised goat meat in massaman curry with sweet potatos and two flavored rotis which completed the dishthen the jewel of the night the burger again another simple design with a simpler name and a result that was mindblowing a quick caveat emptor the burger here is cooked rarer than most so i would suggest getting a medium if youre such to medium rareanyway on to the burger applewood smoked bacon cashew nut butter and ground meat on a chinese bao bun perfectly toasted to a gentle crisp on the outside yet soft sweet and warm on the inside i would have been perfectly satiated with just the bao when it all came together it was simply a surreal experience the sweetness from the bao and butter were perfect for the thick smokey bacon and wonderfully juicy meat needless to say my half of the burger was gone faster than michelle could take a picture then there were the pickles fresh pickles encased by perfect batter literally perfect and literally indescribable just order it and youll know what i meani had an amazing dinner with two appetizers and two entrees which was ridiculously filling i would suggest to just go or in appentree so the next day at work one of my coworkers asked me what cuisine was tttl i simply shrugged and said asian gastropub as absurd as that sounds its really not that far from the truth
hot sexy like sunday on the beachfriendly service like you wish all venues would haveonly a short minute wait without a reservationwhen we were first greeted at the door a french guy answered since i had already put back a few i was in a mood for funny banter can i have your name he asks jennifer i reply shes french too no reaction but he grins a bit let me see if i can get you in at the bar a group may just be leaving i like it when they start out with hardball then backpeddle when they decide they like you i mean thats what were here for right a little banter he returns to explain it will be a few minutes and takes our number so we head across the street to the den of sin where office affairs are unfolding right before our very eyesin what seems like only minutes we get the call and chug our drinks we walk back over and are whisked into this basement den walking through is like a cozy living room cocktails imbibing conversations unfolding even some private rooms that look more like an arab tent in the desert we head further to the back and enter a small room with a waist level table in the middle its a unique setup as bars usually have the bartender up higher as if anointed as a holy one at the alter of drink here they are exactly at the same level as you and you feel like if you dont have their attention you could lean over and poke them at any timethe drink that i settle on is the san luis cup which is spicy with huge chunks of ice and cucumbers i have never been steered wrong by a drink with cucumbers in it this one was superb perfect in every way from the conversation it births to the eyepopping hips that it seemed to unleash in the room i try to stay focused conversation is key meanwhile the drinks chisel away at my head working at me ever so slowly after two we are clearly ready to go but then the dude with the mustache returns and offers us a coveted table a table well we cant turn that down of course so we follow like lemmings ready to order more cocktails and while away the night now we have a tiny table we have a couple of glasses of water and were struggling with this button the wall pushing punching poking nothing works then one of us spots the chain and pulls the light comes out voila shortly thereafter a waitress arrives and takes our order for another roundeventually you reach a point in the evening where youre drunk texting the person youre on a date with although this is sexy and romantic in its own way it also means youve both had enough and its time to go we settle up and stumble out onto the street the spring night air blowing gently and a short walk to union square in front of us
tavern is really trying hard to make a name for themselves as the new kid on the block it replaced the old canzaciti roadhouse it seems that they are pushing specials and deals left and right i know a handful of people including myself and a bunch of reviewers here by the looks of it that won a free night of drinking just for signing up for the contest hey no complaints there you get to drink for free and friends get half off on their drinks im subscribed to their mailing list and often see extra specialsi came the night before july and not only informed the waitress of a off burger deal i was emailed about but also received a text message saying show this text for a free domestic beer yes please the waitress was a little confused with the onslaught of deals i was bringing up but i was not about to pass up on free booze i suppose the lack of communication shows because the waitress was not informed about the deals but its a new place and things like that will get ironed out in time she was very nice about it and asked management to make sure i wasnt making things upspecialsmonday beers and well drinkstuesday free slider they are all usually with purchase of any first beerwednesday on select beer and a cali chicken sandwichthursday bucket of any beers you choosehappy hour is monday through friday any beer is this summer sign up for free drinks and your friends get beers from to midnightladies night on july buy one get one free bottle of wine and off specialty drinks from pm to amthese prices are amazing i came here with a huge group tuesday night we sat in the back room it can be reserved and ordered a ton of beers sliders and burgers because of all the specials it came out to roughly per person insanethe bar is huge so its great for accommodating large groups they have awesome tap tables in the middle so you dont need to keep going to the bar to get beer looks like tavern is trying to make a name for themselves and its working
i cant be objective about this review because swine is my dream restaurant they have a statue of wolverine there are no wordsat first blush swine seems yet another restaurant simply opening to take advantage of a craze in this case the current obsession with meat driven menus this particular menu reads like an amalgamation of a texas state fair and chelsea trendsetters potato chip nachos or lardo swine chop with crispy fingerlings or foie gras torchon as someone whos nearly exclusively carnivorous i was excited but having been disappointed by other similar concepts my skepticism tempered said excitementto forgo the foreshadowing believe the hype this place is damn goodi ordered a buck up cocktail rum infused appreciably with pink peppercorn mixed with grapefruit and ginger topped with soda the ginger doesnt overwhelm all the other components as it is often wont to do and the grapefruit provides a necessary tartness to balance the inherent sweetness of the rum it also serves as an excellent palate cleanser between bites of various small plates m and i shared the ricotta stuffed zucchini blossoms which unexpectedly came on a bed of heirloom tomatoes whose juice was mixed with orange zest and sea salt creating a wonderful brine for the excess ricotta that spilled from the blossoms the combination of creaminess and acidity is a staple to cooking and worked as well in this dish as any other with the orange zest elevating it to something interesting and unique as opposed to another caprese knockoff for our mains m ordered the roast chicken as someone who does not eat red meat there werent many options while i ordered the bone marrow and brisket burgeri try not to use superlatives in reviews as theyre frequently unwarranted but this was one of the best burgers ive eaten in the city i was a little worried that the brisket was going to make the ensuing burger a little tougher than normal but my fears were assuaged after my first bite the light egginess of the bun the sweetness of the caramelized onions the funk of the gruyere and the salty tender savoriness of the meat all went together as perfectly as they can in a burger the crust stood up to the substantial juiciness of the ground beef the brisket added a rich smokiness and the bone marrow added an even richer more intense meatiness the fact that it came with a side of perfectly crisped potato wedges and was only makes this one of the top five burgers in new york hands down the roast chicken was perfectly acceptable but after that knockout of a burger i couldnt care less sorry chickenwe finished the night with their only dessert a bacon hot fudge sundae i dont typically like meaty desserts and if youre like me you likely wont enjoy this sundae it is preposterously bacony that said its my fault for ordering it knowing full well my own preferences in truth i only ordered it in the hopes that as m and i lingered the old couple who were blocking the amazing wolverine statue would leave so i could take a picture when they didnt i just asked if they would move and took a picture around them block my wolverine eh give it up bub also to the waitress who confirmed to m that it was indeed wolverine you are the womanwith the sheer volume of interesting small plates the wellexecuted entrees and affordable yet enticing beer selection im going to be back sooner rather than later if you want to catch swine flu before the hipsters do id suggest you visit soon as well

per se is exquisite one does not come here for a meal one comes for an experience my husband and i enjoyed whats now become fondly known as the best meal of our lives here a few weeks ago food wine service ambiance these qualities harmoniously weave themselves into an exceptional combination at per se service impeccable the waiters struck the perfect balance of considerate but not intrusive friendly but not unprofessional knowledgeable but not pretentious the waiters observed our eating patterns so perfectly we never needed to ask for a single thing they left a pitcher of water on our table but considerately refilled each of our glasses in such a stealthy manner it was as if the glasses were magically filling themselves the servers brought and removed each dish with perfect timing never leaving the plates too long yet also never making us feel rushed as we later learned on the kitchen tour they track each guests dining tempo to ensure this immaculate serveat the end of the evening the staff gave us an interesting booklet about their purveyors as well as copies of our menu printed with a personalized congratulatory message at the top a nice touch as i suspect most people coming to per se are celebrating something or perhaps the upper echelons of society receive a welcome back for your tuesday dinner message ambiance the restaurant was smaller than i expected it has an elegant feel to it with a nice top view of columbus circle and central park greenery we arrived at pm for dinner ending around pm great timing to experience sunlight dusk and evening twinkles fresh flowers abounded throughout the restaurant food we thoroughly enjoyed our tasting menu and all the delicious intermezzos highlights included oysters and pearls famed oysters and caviar dish rich and flavorful egg custard with black truffle oil alternate to the oysters and pearls due to dietary restrictions this was divine warm and rich served in a delicate yet surprisingly strong eggshell very decadent and delicious marinated sungold tomatoes served in earl grey tea vierge which was light and offered the perfect amount of sweetness young almonds thinly sliced cucumbers extremely refreshing tomatoes grown in the french laundry garden sauteed fillet of atlantic striped bass served with peas sweet peppers sprinkled with saffron perfectly sauteed with a slightly crispy edge best fish ive had in a very long time butter poached nova scotia lobster this is the point in the meal at which things seemed unreal it was so good herb roasted squab served with young leeks risotto and surprisingly good roasted grapes served warm calotte de boeuf served with asparagus pommes maxims a potato garnish and bernaise mousselin bernaise sauce with cream rich decadent meat homemade bread and butter sounds simple and it was but done excellently loved the homemade butter both salted fleur de sel and unsalted enjoyed reading about animal farm in the purveyors booklet their sole product is butter for per se french laundry dessert yes it deserves its own category because its amazing often my favorite part of a meal dessert proved no exception at per se several dessert courses including popcorncola the pastry chefs interpretation of a first date made of the things found at the movie theater popcorn flavored sherbet over popcorn raisins soaked in cola cola syrup brownietype cake and these amazing puffs of something that had a fantastic consistency similar to fizz on the top of soda very creative our two dessert courses were followed up by a huge array of desserts at the end of the meal first a waiter came with a huge box of chocolates with three rows dark milk and white each chocolate is uniquely flavored and the presenter explains every single one then endures questions like what was that one again and that one before serving next coffee and donuts frozen espressos served alongside cinnamon sugar donuts are served as well as bon bons cocoa nibs and a tray with three tiers of macarons truffles and other chocolate goodies lastly small drawstring bags of candies are presented to take homeoverall per se did not disappoint it was indeed astronomically priced and quite possibly a onceinalifetime meal but one i will never forget nor regret
so excited that this place has opened you have to go down a narrow flight of stairs to enter but the space itself is long and has good seating decor is adorable and the two servers behind the counter were extremely helpful and care about the drinks we discussed ice brewed vs cold brewed coffeethey serve ice brewed to keep some of the flavor which they care about because they serve counter culture obviously theyre looking to make a quality place which my neighborhood dearly needsthey offer light desserts and fyi have a credit card minimum im looking forward to visiting this place often
value is probably not the first thing that comes to mind on a restaurant but in the realm of omakase jewel bako is a steal the omakase starts at far less than the most other places charge will get you a course tasting of a variety of creatively designed sashimi uni unagi and other treats all of which are flown in fresh every day some notable creations tazmanian king salmon with a smoked soy sauce shiroebi baby white shrimp spanish mackerel and of course lightly seared otoro any reputable omakase will serve the freshest available catch but what really sets an omakase apart is its creativity in preparation taste combinations and presentation jewel bako doesnt serve the best omakase ive ever had but at it is unbeatable in valuea few quick omakase is served at the sushi bar so be sure to specify when you show interest and ask the head chef about whats being served hell often serve up specialextra pieces based on your pair up your omakase with a bottle of coedo beniaka a dark lager fermented with sweet potato absolutely delicious unique and tastes like liquid candied yams

i just cannot say enough good things about mm pest control tim herbie and everyone else at the company are generous honest reliable and professional heres the storya few weeks ago my fianc√© and i had an overnight guest who woke up with mysterious red spots on her face weve all been thoroughly traumatized by the constant fear of bed bugs so we immediately freaked out and called the first bed bug inspection company we looked up it was not mm that was a big mistakethe first company sent over a dog and handler to do an inspection and the whole experience was terrible and unprofessional the handler stomped all over our furniture and bedding in her shoes seemed hostile and distracted the entire time and answered every single one of our questions with i dont know youll have to call the office she didnt even do a visual inspection instead she let her dog do all the worksimply put it did not inspire confidence enter tim wong the director of mm pest control and my freaking hero i had actually talked to tim once before about eight months earlier when david found a shiny spider beetle in our shower and we freaked out of course but tim looked at a photo reassured us that it was not in fact a bed bug and we moved on with our livesapparently right after my friend woke up with those red spots i had left a message on tims phone during my initial meltdown and promptly forgot about it so it came as a surprise when my phone rang and it was tim on the other end of the line whats going on he asked calmlyi told him about everything including our terrible experience with the other inspectors and he confidently told me that he could help a few days later herbie another mm employee showed up with another bugsniffing dog dexterthe two inspection experiences were nightandday different herbie was professional wellinformed and respectful of our apartment while dexter sniffed around herbie took almost ninety minutes to do a painstaking visual inspection of every corner of our apartment he answered all of my questions in detail confirmed that we do not thank god have a bed bug infestation and suggested some possible alternate explanations for what happened to my friends face before he left he gave me a packet of information about how we can protect our apartment in the futuretim and herbie are more than just professional they are generous bed bugs are scary and there are a lot of companies out there that take advantage of peoples fear and panic i know we got screwed by the first company so i am so grateful to tim and herbie for swooping in to save the day thank you thank you thank youtrust me if youre having a pest problem make mm your first and only call im very glad we dont have bed bugs after all but if we did i know wed be in good hands with them
hands down my favorite burger spot everwhen my boyfriend and i first came here we were lost we entered the hotel through the bar which was very classy and made us feel very underdressed we sat in the lobby for a while just looking around and trying to figure out where this place was finally the neon burger sign caught my eye and i followed the light we stepped in and felt properly dressed once again the place had such a chill and laid back feel to it ordering can be a bit intimating at first a guest that we brought here said it reminded him of the soup nazi but it gets easy and it makes for the line to move faster the menu is very simple and has an average amount of seating the employees arent very nice but it doesnt really bother me for some reason since it isnt anything personali would recommend this burger to anyone try it make sure you bring cash as it is cash only
i watched food porns newest heavy hitter a couple of weeks back the sumptuous jiro dreams of sushi and have been salivating voraciously over oftrevisited brainbranded imagery of highresolution nigiri glistening with vinegar sheen ever since so i was primed for azabu which stuffed under the greenwich grill on a desolate stretch of a holland tunnel offshoot was so geographically obscure that it might as well have been tokyo and its prettypenny price point one unit of otoro nigiri costs which cost about the same as my cab ride back to brooklynbut i do not think my recent romantic fantasies of sushi lent azabu any undue credit the nigiri was delicious mackerel tuna i had both said otoro and akami and uni were mouthwateringly perfect the amberjack was a very pleasant surprise the sushi rice was excellent azabu might not be in the same league as jiro but its absolutely sufficient to hold me over until i can foot a substantially more dramatic food pilgrimage the details were immaterial but here they are anyway the service was a little annoying leave me and my fish in peace woman the aged sushi chef spaketh not a word of english oscillating japanese bidet weirdly situated upstairs in the grill

ive been meaning to write this review for a while and somehow im just getting around to it ive been massaged once by king and twice by chris most recently this past friday so i think i have a pretty good grasp of their workfirst off im not a massage therapist but im probably a better judge of a massage than the average person my grandfather is a massage therapist and he started giving me table massage when i was five years old ive had professional massages all over the world five star spas in hawaii private homes in texas outdoor spas in thailand cheapo chinese joints in nyc etc ive had a ton of great massages and a ton of shitty massagesim a very active guy i rock climb or workout in the gym days a week i also work in a hazardous field in which even a slow day can screw up my back when i develop a persistent problem with my back or neck i always turn to a massage therapist to correct the issue before seeing a doctor so i expect quite a bit from a massage therapistchris and king are exactly what i need they both excel at their craft and go above and beyond most massage therapists ive never had a massage therapist sit down with me after my massage to talk about my problem areas and give me advice on what i am doing to cause the problems and how to correct them that alone is worth the price of the massage speaking of the price its perfectly reasonable yea you can get cheaper massages all over the city but youre not going to find this quality of work for any lessi think it might be time to start buying packages and doing a little preventative maintenance on my back
i rolled my eyes when i heard about the chobani bar i assumed it was going to be overpriced and just a waste of space i was wrong the priciest one is at and just a plain yogurt is and they are all served in a glass bowlthat you can later return for cents off of your next yogurt visit i got the plain chobani and cucumberswhich also has mint salt olive oil served with pita chips it was absolutely delightful the mint was the best part as soon as i walked in i was greeted by a chobani employee carrying an iphone ready to jot down my order i gave her my name and she suggested some of her favorites each employee takes care of their own customers orders commission and whatnot i believe they couldnt take tips while you wait for your yogurts to be made you can go over at the bar and watch the people make it there are no seating areas so its all to go the bar looked like a showroom for kitchens so pretty ill definitely be back since i work across the street
excellent meal with the bloomspot pre fixe menu my bf bought a deal for and we left very satisfied and full feeling like we got to sample bondsts best dishes our rez was for sat at they didnt have anything after until when we arrived it was pretty quiet but started bustling at the space is really beautiful except the bathroom is very small but note that with this deal you can only eat in the lounge which is a separate space downstairs if you can try to eat at the bar because honestly the lounge tables are so low you need to hunch down the seats are nice plum benches with pilloweverything looks japanese zen we took a peak at the restaurant the space above which looked also very sleek trendy with flowery decor on the service our waitress was so sweet polite and refilled our waters on time she was not stingy about the deal at all and kept saying it was a sampling of the best dishes she gave good recommendations as well and paced our meal nicely of course every dish had the most beautiful presentationwe had cocktails each i had the st germaine which was very good i love shochu because its not strong i get pretty drunk off it otherwise there was a hint of lemon and elderflowernot sure what that tastes like but it was very sweet my bf got the maurice which he said he didnt like i liked it it had a very ricey aftertaste and wasnt as easy to go down as the st germaine because it was less sweet other suggestions our waitress made was the lychee martini and the dry saketini the tuna tarts awesome my favorite dish it was so buttery because it was thin slices of delicious fleshy tuna soaked in truffles and butterwith some kind of green leaf atop cloveson a crispy thin rice cracker cut into two small pizzas so yummy the red snapper tacos i loved how crispy the taco shells were very freshly fried the snapper was soft and flakyand the guac and lime were great accompanists i would say that this was probably my least favorite dish though excellent the flavors werent as complex ive had this kind of fish taco before the sea bass skewer favorite amazing im glad we got to try this because people like the sea bass at bondst it was perfectly charred on the outside without being overcooked and the bass was so buttery with a yummy sweet sauce the mung bean salad that came with it was also great crispy with a touch of salt main dish rolls of sushi and sashimi the menu gave us a great taste of bondsts sushi and apps our rolls were spicy tuna and shrimp tempura i didnt love the shrimp tempura but then again i am a sushi purist and think anything sushi tempura was made for fake sushi fans the shrimp was very breaded and fried differently from the typical panko batter it was so fried it sort of drown the flavor the spicy mayo that came with this roll had a curry accent the second roll was excellent spicy tuna i could tell the tuna was very richpretty sure it might have been the toro belly i especially loved the rice it was packed with flavor with black sesame which was great the sashimi was very fresh but not the freshest it was firm and had good texture not too goopy hate sashimi thats goopy and cold meaning it was frozen we had slices of big eye tuna salmon and yellowtail yellowtail was my favorite but it usually is very clean dessert chocolate meltdown which was a molten lava cake very delicious but my all time fav molten cake is that of jeangeroges the outside layers were on the drier side not bad just fyi but the middle was very melty it came with espresso ice cream which had a strong flavor and had a bottom cookie crunch they were no pressure to upsell anything we paid tip for excellent service on our pre discounted amount def get this deal if you see it its a steal deal or no deal id come back when i want some yummy japanese this place is kind of like en equally amazing but a bit trendier
stretchedout mediumxl has yet to disappoint my friends and i hk and chelsea cant rely on the ritz and splash alone for our dancing needs i mean remember the days of the roxy spirit and limelightto name a few you eventually developed your favourite spot crowd is very mixed and gaggles of like minded gays tend to cling in certain areas of the dance floor the main dance floor appeals to the more remixdanceelectronic music whereas the other side is much more pop need i mention the stellar sound and lighting system saturday is one of the best nights for musici finally attended their something party and had a blast it wasnt that crowded for a holiday but the people there were cute and fun coat check line always moves pretty quick or at least when the people waiting in line pay attention when the attendant says next contrary to other reviews i have never paid for coat check so i dont know what thats about besidessoon you wont even be needing it the bartenders are always amicable and observant the promoters and door guys definitely remember a face the outside smoking area is convenient and well planned i have rarely waited for the bathrooms here and if there is a line it moves fast tip your attendantoh and if you dont have an xl membership card youre silly its complimentary and grants you discounts on any door cover and drinks
upper east side mourn the loss of francois payard no more you can go to the plaza food hall or columbus circle if you must eric kayser est arrive the maison kayser on third avenue is a boulangerie bakery and patisserie pastry shop with a coffee bar and sitdown restaurant i tried the shop when i stopped by on opening day i did not stay for the restaurant staff were friendly but in the weeds but thats completely expected for the first day heck a work crew was still screwing light fixtures to the facade but who cares they could be spraying a nail gun around the room nothing was going to get between me and parisian baked goodsthe croissant was light and flaky characterizations that are almost cliche with croissants but worth noting for this one it was especially light and especially flaky my favorite croissant in the neighborhood remains that of cafe dalsace but the kayser croissant was terrific as good as ceci cela if not betterthe pain au raisin was not as sweet as i expected but was otherwise so good that i feel like other pain au raisin examples do not measure up to the kayserthe manager convinced me it did not take much to get the pistachio cookie and boy im glad she did crisp with plenty of pistachios and tons of flavor perfectthere were bowls of little financiers for sampling they were good enough that i ended up with a bag of them to go im not sure how that happened they were in with the other goodies when i got home caught up in the frenzy of bakery acquisitions i supposeiced coffee from the coffee bar is delicious though i think i spotted a shot of espresso thrown in cheating perhaps tasty certainly the price was right so no complaints i do not know if the iced coffee is coldbrewed in a bakedgoods delirium i did not think to asknow as for the baguette waiting for laterspeaking of later they will see me again for sure
this review is for bettibarafter we went to b smiths for his birthday dinner my boyfriend told me he wanted to take me to a speakeasy across the street i wasnt sure what to expect and was surprised that there would be such a place on restaurant row but sure enough an older man sitting outside told us to walk up a flight of stairs which led us to our destinationit was dimly lit and felt somewhat clandestine despite the fact that the chances of the place getting raided by the police are pretty slim in this day and age the happy hour special of a beer in a brown bag and a shot cracked me up and i love how committed bettibar is to its theme the atmosphere was very sexy and i loved it the other patrons seemed to be theater people but being there i forgot that i was mere feet away from the hustle and bustle of times square bettibar is a gem and i hope to be back soon
on an otherwise quaint quiet residential block we at first walk right past it the exterior is so unassuming that its easy to miss once inside once weve adjusted to the hushed dimness of this velvet and maroon lounge its only a few short moments until weve found a table you can tell its a saturday night but at the same time its not too crowded not too loud she speaks into my ear and i hear her the music permeates rather than irritates i almost lose myself to the soundtrack of my youth when we dont even care as restless as we are but am instead struck by the soft light reflected in the depths of her eyes leaning towards her i ask do you want something to drink white russian she says it doesnt take long to get the bartenders attention hes good efficient proficient the price is upper east side but ok even for an indebted grad student like myself we linger only for a little while on this particular evening but the mood induced by a few drinks matched with the perfect ambience means this memorable spring night is not over we should have come here more oftenseriously though this place is awesome
favorite place in nyc hands down done no words speechless cant talk drooling cant stop wont stop if this isnt a gem in this neighborhood or in nyc i dont know what is beer cheese toasty bread soft cheese and garlic cloves uhh what do we do with these raw garlic cloves we rub them on our bread son ingenious just ingenious pulled pork taco with scallion pancakes i never really liked pulled pork but when its full of fat and flavor im game with the crispy scallion pancake on the bottom it just worked cilantro and lime on pork how perfect can life be oh by the way they are not closed on thursdays and yes i ran home to write this next daydamn right i went back the next day pork belly sammich with kimchi and fried egg as good as what i had yesterday golden egg yolk sipping into toasty bread and salty pork belly i never liked kimchi but it added just the right kick to this ive been spreading the word to strangers i see on the streets and at work this is serious
club a steakhouse attracted us with a threecourse steak dinner for two on a living social deal for no wine included the best thing about the deal was that we can use for more than people in one sitting not usually available with other deal offers this was perfect for our birthday celebration for my bff with a party of the only restriction for a saturday reservation was that we must be dine between or after it worked out perfectly the waiters were very cordial and respectful they worked together as a team to provide excellent service we can call anyone of them and get results immediately we were very happy with the wine list and selections i would say handreds of bottles that you can choose from and from different regions superbthe meal was scrupulously delicious for appetizer we ordered canadian bacon steak tartare caesar salads for entree we ordered filet mignon trout veal hanger steak salmon for side dishes we ordered creamed spinach mac and cheese mash potatoes of course i took a bite from everyones dish the chinese way for dessert there were only choices tiramisu and creme puffs yummyan immediate followup to club a steakhouse yelp review and i changed my star to a star rating the reason i received a personalized thank you call from the owner bruno for our business the past saturday and review on yelp i learned that brunos brother owns ninos restarant what a coincident i have tried the ninos steakhouse restaurant and enjoyed it as well that is what i call star class a customer service thank you bruno
this place looks good in a traditional italian way beautiful but not fancy many interesting details to study in every nook and corner apparently its authentically sicilian i cant vouch for that though it feels like many trattorie ive been to in other parts of italy it just opened a week ago and still kinda has that newrestaurant smell many servers some still learning the ropes were roaming the place giving lots of attention there were a few moments of confusion but their friendliness made up for it i guess their oldfashioned black and white outfits with caps are meant to be a traditional touch though the managers are in modern italian suits bread was served with authentic sicilian olive oil both of high quality a fresh sardine appetizer was sublime butterflied and panfried and indeed fresh tasting and served with a nice salad tossed with fennel and orange segments i can be kinda squeamish about fishiness and this didnt have any though it did have tiny bones that crunched right up easily the grilled vegetable app was also good though nothing showstopping ordered this to try and please newly vegetarian child we tried the pappardelle with pistachio cream potatoes and green beans and it was so comforting it was really about the perfectly silky fresh noodles and the light nutty cream sauce a few al dente chunks of potato and a scattering of bright green beans looked nice in the toss also tried the angel hair with sea urchin and bottarga tuna roe i didnt notice the bottarga but the uni was as light as egg custard mixing in beautifully with the spicy pasta we got the sicilian ros√© and it went well with all the dishes and didnt give heartburn to the walletoh yeah daughter got the pizza with cherry tomatoes a small was huge nice crust kinda sweet from the tomatoes she loved itsince the pastas were so good we decided to try a couple of desserts thats where our bill and our calories really started adding up but pretty much worth ita tiramisu was classically perfect fresh and light and the tiny chocolate cake with gooey center was spoton though i cant say it was italian in any way both tasted like they were made very recently i think they were each and a thimble of espresso literally two sips was authentic in size but not in price other miscellaneous observationsreally nice bluetiled bathrooms the oversized white couch in the front would be great for lounging with a prosecco or some snacks but i have a feeling it might get replaced with dining tables if this restaurant is successful wall projections of sicily maps and scenes and a sunset constantly being broadcast on a flatscreen tv are corny but the rest of the decor kinda makes up for it

if i lived in a perfect world anita lo would be that aunt of mine who always cooks a tablefull during the holidays hey were both chinese a girl can dream even though this world isnt quite perfect im happy to be able to come to annisa and experience chef anita los cooking firsthandthe boy brought me here to celebrate our anniversary and i really couldnt have been more blown away by his surprise and the meal every single dish that came out of the kitchen and under chef los watchful guard was absolutely delightful and full of fantastic flavors seared foie gras with soup dumplings its certainly not hard to see why this appetizer would be one of the most popular offerings here the tender dumplings full of powerful porky broth and just a hint of rich foie and duck fat was a total explosion of flavors in my mouth the jicama a root vegetable i love played well in complementing the richness of the dumpling filling and added some expected contrast perhaps like how water chestnuts usually would the foie gras was luxurious and buttery as it should be and i really enjoyed the depth in flavor it picked up from the quick sear broiled spanish mackerel with garlic fried milk satsumaimo korean chili the perfect homage to korean homecooking but much more updated and sexy braised mackerel with gojujjang is one of my favorite dishes but chef los interpretation really outdoes the traditional dish by adding texture with the nutty broiled skin creaminess with the garlic fried milk and crunchy satsumaimo cubes its difficult to cook spanish mackerel because its such a oily and strong fish but the fillets were so thin and broiled so perfectly that i practically wanted to lick my plate the chili sauce included grilled wagyu with escargots garlic chives alba mushrooms this was the bfs entree choice so i cant comment on it too extensively the wagyu was cooked to rare as the chef suggested and he really thought that rare was the way to go he loved the silky butteriness of the beef commenting that the fat was perfectly strewn out through the entire cut and in every morsel i personally tried a piece of the escargot which was perfectly cooked and certainly unexpected to be paired with beef a play on surf turf perhapsand for dessert we opted to share the tower of caramelized banana and peanut butter with coconut sauce the presentation of it first off was simple and beautiful reminiscent of a napoleon this tower consisted of layers of whipped sweet peanut butter and a luscious cream bruleed bananas and some sort of nutty thin crisp the coconut sauce that was almost foamlike was classically asian in flavor and made the dish lighter it shocked me how well coconut and peanut butter works together i cant believe no one has thought of that soonerthis was certainly one of the most memorable dinners ive had in the city not just because it was a lovely anniversary surprise but chef lo truly blew me away with her inventiveness and technique it would be a crime to dub the food at annisa as asian fusion but if there was ever a good way to fuse asian flavors with french technique and marketdriven ingredients this is it
so there is deff hype around these lobstah rolls and its well deserved it wasnt until the great googamooga that i had my first lukes experience not only did i wait in a line of about people but it was hot as hell that day too worth the wait absolutely i was almost in tears when it ended i knew i should have gotten a whole cheapso with that being said after the tasting i needed luke back in my life stat i also seriously needed a foodie dinner date with my girl of course we went to the east village location because thats the hood we love we knew on a friday we were taking our chance at this small little eatery which meant quite possibly not getting a seat but we went in for the killstroll in glance at the menu although i already knew then step right up and place your order one lobstah roll with a pickle of course and one crab roll okay so yah its a little pricey but its beyond worth it then the waiting game began for both food and seats as soon as our food was out it just happened to be luck of the draw that two seats were about to open up seats snagged it was time to dig in i had been craving this roll for quite some time all conversation stopped since i had to chow down now im from new england so i like to think i know good seafood what i love about lukes is the fact that they dont drown the lobster in mayo its just enough to give it some flavor but its not overpowering the lobster is always fresh and meaty i want to say its claw meat but im not on that and nothing completes a new england lobstah roll like a big sour pickle and a bag of salt and vinegar chips cape cod chips at that my friend decided to mix it up and go with the crab roll which she was very pleased with the other thing to note about these rolls is now they actually treat the roll its like this delicate little thing lightly buttered and thrown on the griddle for a few seconds just to give it some color but also add a little bit of warmth the roll i just have to ask one thing what is better than good company and a delicious meal if youve got something better for me please enlighten m

i love the smell of gunpowder in the morning nothing like smoking shell casings packing your own ammo and a hot cup of coffee to get your blood pumpingthis had to be one of the most fun things i have done with my merry group of yelp friends what better way to celebrate a birthday julia b than by shooting round after round of caliber bullets at multiple targetsfeel the firepowerthe west side rifle pistol range is just an amazing place hidden away in the basement level of a building that is very normal looking on west street as you enter the actual facility it is like being exposed to another world everyone who works there is packing heat including the tattooed up older gentleman manning the main counter who would probably blow your head off with a wink of the eye you constantly hear the pop pop pop of guns being fired pictures and posters of celebrities and important people who have been here line the walls this is a world seemingly unknown to most before coming here you need to have a background check ahead of time and if you are lucky enough to pass that then you are in first time entrance fee is and that covers a three month trial membership rounds of ammo and a safetytraining session with a certified shooting instructor our instructor raymond was terrific not only was he very personable but highly informative patient and funny too he taught us all the basics of using a ruger caliber rifle loading unloading stance arming the magazines how to hold the gun safely etc he is a pro and did not take this lightly which is best for all it had been a while since i had been out shooting and having this course as part of the package is a great idea they are dead serious about safety here i was surprised they let our marginally demented group actually hold weaponsraymond then led us to one of the firing ranges the range had seven stations which was just right for our party and some random dude that barged in on our birthday group he told us there is always a spot open to shoot if we ever come back as i think there is more than one range we had a blast each one of us was firing away at targets and feet away you can get cocky and push the target far out to the back wall and see how good you are we all did pretty well as shell casings bounced all around i was surprisingly accurate considering i had not shot a rifle in years just remember to sweep up your area as casings are everywherei absolutely loved this place i feel everyone should know how to handle a weapon safely learn how to shoot and its also a great way to develop handeye coordination plus its a good stress reliever the three month membership means that you can return at any time without making an appointment redoing the background check or having to sit through the safety class again you pay just a visit plus ammo rounds you are issued a card with your name date you first came and a membership number a year membership is very affordable at only plus if you sign up within a week of your first visit they apply that towards it so the cost ends up being for the year which includes unlimited shooting time and no range fees this is a terrific dealof course we all went out drinking after this with my birthday coming up this might make for a great gift that i will surely use need to start dropping the hints looks like now i will be ready to kill many zombies as watching all those episodes of the walking dead will not go to waste
this is where i sound off on the longstanding rivalry between ippudo and tottoippudo has good ramen but is more style than substance totto is where you go to eat the best ippudo is where you take a group of outoftowners totto is where you go to eat alone or with one other i love ramen all kinds ive tried minca setagaya hidechan momofoku noodle bar and menkuitei i find that i prefer the smaller more authenticfeeling joints like minca and totto cramped intimate where you can watch the chefs prepare your foodthats what i like if youre not into that that youll probably have a more pleasant experience at momofoku or ippudo the wait is a factor of course dont be intimidated by the mobs of people outside the line will move a lot faster than you think i waited around minutes on a monday night during peak hour but it wasnt terribleas for the ramen at totto the broth is what sealed the deal its so rich and flavorful but not too salty im looking at you minca the noodles are also a perfect firm texture proportions are just right smaller than minca but larger than ippudo worth the trek and worth the wait if youre craving topnotch ramen

my first experience with la maison was receiving a variety of tiny chocolates in an ornately wrapped box as part of a larger care package i didnt think much of it at the time the brand not the chocolate the chocolate was amazing but when i first moved to ny the harpies in my office would not shut up about macarons cough i mean they lovely women all of them insisted that i had to try macarons from these five places and tell them which was best now as someone who makes his own macarons on occasionsay something emasculating i dare you i really didnt understand the hubbub then i went on this ignoble macaron quest lets just say theres a reason i dont make macarons professionally that reason is it doesnt pay enough zing but seriously they are a massive pain in the ass to get righti saved la maison for last and it didnt disappoint while it wasnt my favorite it was a close call the chocolate filling is an interesting and understandable twist but it does sometimes mask the base flavors of the macaron that said you dont come here solely for macarons i mean you could but that would make you a massive pillock the hot chocolate varieties are fantastic as is really any form of the chocolate itself i dont think theres anything here that you shouldnt try at least once obviously a lot of it depends on what youre looking to get out of a chocolate but trust me when i tell you they have pretty much anything for you unless youre a weirdo and want some flash in the pan fad flavor that is questionable to add to chocolate in the first place like yuzu or something in which caseshove off weirdo
after all my cellphone adventures i suddenly feel the urge for a banh mi sandwich not noodles not pizza nothing else will dobeing a new yorker im spoiled that way i feel like whatever urge strikes me i should be able to satisfy it at any moment hours a day firing up yelp on my brand spanking new iphone takes about one gajillionth of a second and there on my screen lies banh mi mecca only one block north from my current fixie coordinates how can this be what god is smiling down on me today perhaps its because my birthday is only a couple of weeks away and im already bathing in the good luck vibes heading over i lock up my ride and stroll into the shop it looks almost like a grocery store at first unadorned except by a teaming mass of people around the checkout register on one side a guy is yelling out numbers of previously ordered sandwiches and the other a lady takes orders i ask for a banh mi buddhist because well you know im bald and vegetarian so what the hell else would i order she takes my ten and it disappears into some money pit in the basement and five few well worn singles are returned to me thats it cash only reads the sign on the register i love chinatown shortly thereafter order number comes up and well the stars couldnt be any more aligned today as the sandwich that they hand over to me is well probably the most delicious banh mi ive ever had soft tofu marinated shiitake mushrooms basil cucumbers even the roll seems delightful i chomp and chomp and chomp some more the sunshine is streaming in from the front door beckoning me on with this great day so i toss my garbage and head out the door with a big fat smile on my chubby cheeks
i am going to be as objective and informative as i can in my review with this studio and just state the facts and also highlight important details for those who may be interested in practicing here and what they should prepareexpect practice what you should expect is truetoscript bikram yoga the best instructors dont go off on a tangent or get wordy while were holding poses my instructorclass recommendations are those led by upkar and eddie kelly and jenna the above teachers commit to correcting your form especially if its your first time studio the floors are not carpeted but instead are of a plastic material in order to prevent stinkyness to be honest with you it still smells like a bikram yoga studio and you can either live with it or do with out crowd expect it to get crowded im talking mattomat elbowtoelbow and expect this to contribute to the extra hotness of the room therefore be very wellhydrated before class and prepare to feel like you are going to die yes even for consistent practitioners times peak times are usually pm or pm on weekdays and am on weekends be sure to arrive at least minutes before class to check in at the front desk i would recommend the am class on sunday morning not as crowded and the evening class on fridays where youll see the least amount of crowds be ready to enter the studio minutes prior to the start of class locker room space the locker room is small use whatever space you have to efficiently and expeditiously change in and out of your clothes everyone is considerate of each other and orderly the locker room has two hair dryers qtips handsoap small plastic bags for your wet clothes and shower gel and shampoo are provided waiting the congestion in the lockerroom after class mixes with those getting ready for the next class so itll be a while till you can get your turn in the shower id say minutes after recess swipe card when you sign up for your membership be sure to ask for a swipe card which you can link to your key chain this will help you to sign in to class more expeditiously and this helps control traffic at the front desk as for those whove practiced at other studios in the city you will be some what disturbed by the excess chatter before and after class in the studio and the somewhat lax attitude towards students running in and out in the middle of class to use the bathroom the studio is managed very well despite its high volume traffic and front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming fellow students are orderly and courteous and everyone is generally polite and in a good mood all the time its a positive atmosphere and once you get used to the crowdedness and the chattiness in the studio and the locker rooms you may start feeling really at home at bikram yoga grand central
always do sober what you said youd do drunk that will teach you to keep your mouth shut hemingway i finally made it to death co with almost reviews of this place its hard to be original however when youve finally struck gold and experienced the best place to find a cocktail in all of new york its hard not to write about it the scene was a busy saturday evening ish we walked up and my man sam outside the door told me there would be a hour wait no worries friends this is the east village home to plenty of establishments to get our drink on while we wait we gave sam our digits and moved on our way see youre not even technically standing around waiting so i see no need for complaints two hours later we checked back with sam who told me it would be another half hour it is worth the wait be patient young grasshopper at an unknown number flashed across the screen and i screamed in delight finally the moment had come we walked in and as others have noted i was surprised at how small dc was the place is dark with black walls and candlelit tables two chandeliers hang in the front over the booths near the door its quiet dark and sexy we were seated in a booth near the back this is not the type of place you come with the sole purpose of getting drunk although that is a reasonable outcome you come here to converse with friends to sip well crafted cocktails and witness the magic around you the bartenders here are half artists half mad scientist and all around simply exceptional i must admit ive never been a whiskey girl i like my wine and tend to pick something with bubbles vodka or gin at dc not only did i not stray off the whiskey page but i simply fell in love rye whiskey rye whiskey rye whiskey i cry if i dont get rye whiskey i surely will diemy first drink the jackal and hide was a delicious bourbon beverage with one single large ice cube love that and an orange peal garnish the next beverage came in a martini glass with knappogue irish single malt the name escapes me these cocktails will do that to you but i really dont think you can go wrong with any selection at death co
i got thrown out of pkny last night and im still giving them five stars that should tell you somethingmy boyfriend and i wandered over here with a friend of ours last night despite the fact that it was on a saturday it wasnt too crazy inside and we could immediately get a table niceafter we sat down we realized that we had actually sampled of one of pknys cocktails before at yelps starr african rum challenge event at hotel chantelle although i didnt vote for pknys drink at that event it won overall and was definitely delicious so obviously the bartenders at this place know what theyre doingon the waiters suggestion we ordered three drinks from their top list the missionarys downfall which was blended minty and delicious the pk which was coconuty pineappley and creamy and well weve forgotten the name of the last drink but it was served with one of those fun flaming limes on top i am henceforth going to be underwhelmed by any cocktail presentation that doesnt involve firewe drank enough of our cocktails to know that they were all super yummy when dun dun duhnnn a man came by and asked for our ids we shall henceforth call him mr just doing his job my boyfriend showed his id our friend showed her id and aaaall the way up in the upper west side my id shed a single tear as she sat forlornly in my wallet which was in my purse which was in my apartment you have to leave said mr just doing his jobcan we finish our drinks first i askedno barked mr jdhj the police will come and arrest me which makes perfect sense because its not like the nypd really has anything better to do eye roll but who am i to argueso i shuffled over to our waiter um hi i mumbled i know this definitely isnt your fault and i totally should have brought my id but um since there was no one carding at the door and we didnt finish our drinks we kind of feel like we shouldnt have to pay for themi mean these drinks were like a pop is a lot to spend on cocktails that we had like four sips of you knowto my surprise he didnt miss a beat oh my gosh of course you dont need to pay for them he said smiling mr jdhj was a bit late tonight usually hes at the door sorry about thathow rad is that totally friendly considerate customer service i thanked him and said that i would absolutely come back someday soon with my id proudly brandished like a battle swordand i totally will
heed my warning pegu club may arouse your inner erotic creature you go onmaybe it was the company maybe it was the music maybe it was the alcohol maybe it was the fact that we were surrounded by sexy women on the prowl and we started discussing our preferences and fetishes wait wait im getting off track hereallow me to break pegu down for you based on my experience do you ever have one of those clich√© new york city fantasies where you meet some mysterious man or woman at a mysterious bar and the entire atmosphere literally makes the whole evening a tense session of mindstimulating foreplay which then leads to the obvious resulting scenario ok so i didnt exactly meet up with a mysterious stranger for my evening at pegu but that is exactly the feeling i got while i was there as some of my guy friends might say this place has the potential to seal the deal it has that vibe that lavish teasing sensual encompassing vibe that makes you feel like youre a super model incognito to me the decor just oozes sexy confidence and from surveying the room i could tell it was rubbing off on people i know it was rubbing off on meso now that ive probably warmed you up a little bit lets focus on the most important reason why people come to pegu the drinks for myself i started off with a la fluer de paradis at the bar counter our bartender has somewhat of a famous reputation for crafting delectable drinks according to your tastes and i was looking forward to trying what he chose for me i was informed that my cocktail had been created using gin and la germaine sweet like flowers crisp and strong without being bitingly so i normally do not love gin based drinks but i found this to be a very pleasant surprise next at the suggestion of my alcoholic partner in crime for the evening i chose the earl grey martini at this point we had scored a two person table on the far side that came with two plush chairs ah it felt so good to sit back sip and take in the scenery while engaging in inappropriate conversation with my compadre the earl grey martini is probably one of the more interesting drinks ive had in my lifetime the top third of this drink is basically all foam and a small bit of orange peel just dive right in and slurp that head you imagine it will taste like tea but it instead shocks you with a strong citrus flavor at first sip the citrus flavor then transitions from sweet to the slight bitterness of earl grey and then to something more round and full in essence im not quite sure what was all going on with my taste buds but i liked itby the way i loved our waitress she had a little bettie paige thing going on with her bangs and bold lipstick such a doll she enthusiastically served our drinks the rest of the evening at our table she basically cheered me on when i decided to step up my game and order two old fashioneds knock knock im drunk in hindsight not the smartest decision ive made but it tasted so good and went down smoothly i didnt gag at all like i normally do on whiskey impressivethe music definitely changed at one point to a beat i wanted to jump up and dance to amongst other things i remember being asked at one point why was i scratching the table slowly with my nails i dont recall giving an answer and im sure as hell not going to give you one now watch out if youve been sitting down and have had drinks as that first walk to the washroom to fix your lipstick can be quite a doozy i can personally assure you you are definitely getting your moneys worth with your liquorwe decided to call it a night as my funds had run embarrassingly low and my friend was hungry for deliciously greasy noodles pegu aint cheap but i bet you already knew that while it wasnt really crowded when i entered around on friday night the room had filled up immensely as we stumbled and i do mean stumbled out at club stands for the most part unmarked on the street only betraying its presence with an emblem on its door that changes colors depending on the day while not technically a speakeasy there are no big signs or flashing neon lights to catch your eye sadly like some of the better things in life it can be easily missed if you arent looking for it for those of us who know what were looking for we are lucky with its incredible drinks swanky decor and sexy aura pegu club is surely an establishment you dont want to pass by
the birthday boy i brought here brought me back here for christmas and we agree there will also be a next timethe masa experience is euphoric each dish each bite each taste is exhilarating chef masa knows just how to get those endorphins flowing and delights your taste buds just perfectly so the brain knows no law of diminishing marginal utility the menu comprises fish caviar shellfish and vegetables with option to add meat and dessert the optional courses can be shared its best to sit at the sushi bar although there are tables in the dining room if you have a larger party by the way masa eliminated the nongratuity service chargethe meal starts with hairy crab followed by toro tartar and caviar then comes fugu prepared both fresh and fried equally scrumptious after that comes langoustine this may be the one course where you feel somewhat out of place sucking and pulling with your bare hands in the middle of a zenlike sushi bar next comes wagyu beef with truffle if you havent had multiple foodgasms before this course well this is honestly like tasting the essence of culinary perfection finally before moving on to sushi that is you have the white yellowtail shabu shabu fyi you may well be feeling intoxicated by this point and not necessarily from the sakenow we take a little breather until the chef asks ready for sushi its a rhetorical question of course youre elated youre enthralled you will eat whatever youre served which is good because the next hour or so entails eating right out of the chefs hands one piece of delectable mouthwatering sushi at a time until youve tried all plus the roll the experience at masa doesnt end until you and your tummy determine its over so i tried to remember which pieces i wanted to ask for more of another toro another uni aoyagi sayori but after the last amazing piece i realized it was a moot point i had just completed one fabulous meal and i was perfectly satiated
i am a huuuugggeeeeee fan of special rolls ie ones with multiple fishes sauces toppings etc apparently those arent common in nyc so when i found this place i was quite ecstaticthe location is hidden off the main street and can be missed it has such a comfortable romantic feel to it and the service is amazing they have a lot of options but as i mentioned earlier i am the special rolls type of gal and theyve got a lot of those here they are a bit pricey averaging but it is worth every pennyi order delivery for lunch here often at work and even got some coworkers to eat different fishesseafoods that theyve never imagined themselves eating needless to say this is a regular spot for sushi for me

for our wedding we received a generous gift certificate to the famed per se as a joint wedding gift from our families the restaurant only books up to months in advance so we found ourselves having to call at exactly and exactly months before our preferred dining date this was slated to either be the best dining experience of my life or the most uncomfortable as i imagined being surrounded by stuffy executives who would judge me for using the wrong fork for background i was born and raised in a lowerincome inner city housing project of nyc where crime and poverty prevailed so while i have been fortunate enough to experience some of the best foods that nyc has to offer many have been at the mere tune of a dish ie the best vietnamese pho soup in chinatown in other words i am not compelled by the image of class and actually find that many of the pricey restaurants leverage amazing views overthetop decor and impeccable service to make up for what they lack in the flavor and quality of foodwhen i arrived at the address i was immediately thrown by the oddity of its location this critically acclaimed onceinalifetime culinary journey all courses of it that i was about to embark on was located in the shops of columbus circle at the time warner building of nyc of all places a mall but as i arrived via escalator to the top floor of the mall i realized that i had transcended to a place beyond stores beyond shoppers beyond the noise i had arrived at the per se entrance and i was thoroughly excited contrary to what one might expect per se was not obnoxiously luxurious or stuffy there were no goldplated fountains or giant crystal chandeliers hanging throughout instead it was classy simplicity going with the less is more approach a unique positioning of its splitlevel flooring ensured that every seat in the house has a window view the service was excellent servers were friendly engaging and casual not overbearing but perfectly in tune with the appropriate level of interaction and timeliness they all seemed to know that this would be a rare experience to most guests so they did all that they could to accommodate and let us take it all in to make our culinary journey an enjoyable onethe tasting menu which actually comes with additional courses not listed is priced at a person tax and gratuity are included on the left side of the menu is a vegetarian option on the right side of the menu is the standard offering with steak seafood fois gras etc the guest merely picks a menu side vegetarian or standard and the journey begins with beautifully artistic and amazing creations brought out one course at a time because i knew we had a cushion on the gift card i opted to upgrade to the dry aged wagyu beef for a supplemental i nearly laughed out loud when my little piece of steak came out but when i placed a slice in my mouth i swear it was worth every incremental penny the beef literally melted on my palette and the steaklover that i am conceded that it was the best cut of steak i had ever tasted in my life but that would be the start of a trend where everything i tasted became my new favorite my description here does not do it justice but if i can express anything it is that i have learned through this dining experience that more is not better and that food is indeed an art form every tiny bite explodes with such robust flavors that it defies logic and science subsequently it is with rave reviews that i encourage people to experience the wonders of per se i am embarrassed and sorry for prejudging the restaurant based on its location and for doubting michelin and the google reviewers to date who have basically given it top honors and while i will likely never get the opportunity to return this was a once in a lifetime opportunity that was worth every penny of my final bill even without any money for wine

it was a lovely and lazy spring afternoon and i was playing neighbourhood tour guide to some friends in between ducking into the little nondescript shops that lined the area between ave and ave a i noticed good beer yeah this place is called good beer naturally the name itself just called to menot unlike most establishments in the east village good beers space is not big what they lacked in seating they more than make up for in beer selection they also have several beers on tap for customers to order and sample right in the store with the top of a low cabinet in the middle of the floor serving as a table to put your beer i saw a couple having a sampler of four different beers and since there were four of us i immediately suggested we ordered thatthe beers were delicious and also they were playing biggie five stars

its interesting to see such a wide range of reviews for luna piena but i can assure you that the one time ive visited so far everything was excellenti actually learned about luna piena from the concierge at a hotel where my parents were staying across town we were looking for a good place in midtown east and this one was at the top of his list its easy to see whythe atmosphere was elegant and intimate we sat in the back room close to the waterfall there was quiet music on but we could easily converse at a normal speaking volume i tried one of the specialty cocktails which was made with grey goose pearinfused vodka yumthe frito misto appetizer is awesome if you like fried stuff calamari shrimp zucchini and mushrooms all mixed together the lasagna del mamma tasted truly homemade though i can assure you that my moms was never this good to be fair were jewish not italian so its not really our specialty luna piena boasts a number of dessert options from traditional tiramisu creme brule to exotic poached pear with sorbets and gelatos in between you cant misslots of the complaints i see are about the price and its definitely not cheap but our bill came out to which isnt bad considering we had several appetizers multiple drinks and dessert for per person you wont find a better italian meal anywhere else grazie luna piena
wow easily one of the best meals ive had in a long long time ive already made plans to come back here tomorrow and will be returning multiple times to try every single thing on the menufirst no i dont get the name and theres no heartwarming story printed on the menu about how the place came to be but whatever its a toucan and a mothain lion roll with it man i have a fondness for asianinspired cuisine so this menus panasian focus was instantly appealing with elements of thai and malaysian cuisine receiving particular emphasis we started off with a drink and went with the lion in the summer which was a solid concoction though not as potent as id expect from a handcrafted specialty cocktail we then dove right into our main course and since im obsessed with mussels you are what you eat which means im musselcular yeeeeea girl i went for the pei mussels drenched in a delectablesounding chili curry while my buddy opted for the famed burger i still cant stop thinking about the mussels they were perfectly cooked while the sauce was tangy delicious and the perfect creamy consistency for postmusselbreadmopping but this wasnt served with just any bread oh no it comes with pieces of immaculately toasted lightly buttered meltinyourmouth bao buns that literally stopped me midsentence upon my first bite heaventhen our server swung by and said hey guys so tonights dessert is a kaffir lime pie our asianinspired take on key lime and baconglazeddonuts we also have whoa whoa whoa buddy are you seriously still standing there you just put bacon and donuts in the same sentence and act like i care about anything you have to say after that our server perhaps freaked out by our intense ravenous reaction quickly brought them out minutes later and we dove into one of the most mindblowing desserts ive ever had four lightly glazed chocolate donuts topped with generous sprinkles of coconut shavings little bacon bits baked into every bite all swimming around in a fabulous vanilla reductionnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnah sorry got lost thinking about those little baked balls of perfection and let my finger linger on the keyboarddddddddd dammit not again ok so clearly i was blown away by every aspect of my meal now to address some of the intangibles the service was excellent our super friendly easygoing server was fantastic throughout the entire meal and knew exactly when to interrupt avoided refilling our water every seconds like some of the more maniccompulsive servers ive recently encountered and he delivered all of his spoton recommendations with certainty the dude knew his stuff and you could tell he loved working here one caveat though this is not a place to come with a group of more than or unless you have a reservation well in advance theyve really gotta work out their seating arrangement in general we were unfortunately placed at the end of a communal table right next to the door so the draft wound up kicking our poor napkins asses everywhere anytime someone walked in or out it was also a pain for the people sitting to our left to have to climb over me like a drunk gorilla to use the restroom or you know go anywhere a few tweaks could be used to streamline thingsbut to truly seal the deal we used a scoutmob deal and got bucks off our bill i simply downloaded the scoutmob app while we were waiting for a table and showed it to our server and he immediately deducted from our bill no questions asked and more importantly no annoyance that we were one of those customers using an online deal the deal is good till august so theres really no excuse to not try this place out a mouthwatering plate of mussels a gourmet burger fried pickles drinks and an unforgettable dessert came out to with tip you honestly cant beat that or maybe i should say woohoo as good as it gets
casual chic chilldrinks small bites with cozy upstairs barmaybe im just a fan of the fireplace downstairs or maybe it was the cozy little bar upstairs then i had the meatballs and a salad then i had some drinks met some nice people had a great conversation with the bartenders and brought friends back on several occasions i guess over time this place has grown on me wonderfully cute unpretentious and very laid back love the rustic interior the antiques and the good ol flag carried over from beatrice inn still have yet to have a full dinner here or take a table love the cozy little bar area on a week night when its not packeddate rating up scale people seem pretty friendly here but mostly keep to themselvesstrong suggestion have a snack and if youre not sure what to drink let the bartender make something special for you ps this place is easy to pass by when youre walking down the street its near the odeon
i have probably walked passed i sodi a number of times and never noticed it was there now i hesitate to write this review to keep the restaurant a well kept secret however i know that is pretty foolish as there are over reviews and it was recently featured in a pasta dishes to eat before you die in nyc if you never make it to italy come here and get the cacio e pepe because it truly is the best version ive ever had this side of the pond the restaurant itself is small cozy and apparently once was a sushi restaurant which explains the sliding screen doors and lots of light wood around the bar area the place only seats about or so people so make a reservation if its a weekend the wait staff was friendly helpful and always checking in on us throughout the meal a long lost art at many restaurants in the cityother must artichoke salad simple artichokes with cheese on cacio e the chocolate salami dessert served with vanilla gelato and slices of salami which are really just chocolate ganash with gram cracker pieces to look like marble salami for specials if they have them get the taglietelle with meat ragu it was to die for and im a ragu snob anyway run do not walk to i sodi you wont regret it

its not even funny how serious the corn is youll never eat your veggies in the same way again unless theyre smothered in cheese chili powder and lime juice i dont even want to write much about it because descriptive words cannot do this corn justice its the most succulent thing your lips have ever encountered you take a bite and your teeth just sink into the thick layers of corn as your come up for air and your nose is covered in white powder like so many wall st execs youll start to taste each flavor first with the roasted buttery corn then the cheese that is melting off of the teeth marks you just made and finally the kick of lime accentuates each flavorful morsel and the fact that you only spent for each ear makes you justify wanting to buy eight more and call it a day this corn is that piece of food you crave when youre hundreds of miles away from cafe habana lying in bed at night wondering why you ever left a city capable of turning out such exquisitely delicious and affordable food no fuss simple restaurant with a charm all of its own within the trendy prince st area if youre hungry go crazy and get at least two pieces this is a star establishment all the way but dont take my word for itafter all im only going off of my melancholy memory of some addictive corn
last night i melissa f fell in love with a place located on the west side this is no small feat and a part of me isnt pleased with myself but what can i saythe heart wants what it wantsafter an illfated aimless wandering search for a wine bar that didnt have a minute wait for a table my partner in crime and i decided to settle for the bar across the street from our original target upon walking in we were greeted by a friendly hostess who led us to a cozy table in the back of pour george the main bar area is extremely long and spacious and the back seating area also offers room for small parties as well as large groupsafter perusing the menu it became very apparent to us that pour george isnt a regular bar but rather a gastropub with an impressive menu featuring small bites and entrees including duck bone marrow and oysters as well as cheese plates and other various snacks in terms of drinks they have an impressive drink menu as well comprised of various beers both craft and regular a small but comprehensive wine list and a great offering of specialty cocktails in terms of food we decided on the cheese plate they rock a pretty decent cheese list and we chose dont recall which but they were delicious roasted beets grilled cheese sandwich and french fries perhaps it was the effect of being on weight watchers for a week and a half but all the above were amazing dessert yes please we had the nutella crepes and the whiskey bread puddingnote the whiskey bread pudding doesnt present the whiskey very subtly and im pretty sure that if the three glasses of wine i had didnt make me mild to moderately tipsy than the whiskey bread pudding sealed the dealin terms of ambiance its simply amazing and what made me fall in love well that and the grilled cheese not too loud great music including but not limited to radiohead the xx florence and the machine dimly lit and super friendly staff am i going to drag my ass back to the west side to come here again you bet

since i went to sala one nine ive been trying to find a reason to not give it five stars and i cantto begin with the mood is perfect for any occasion its dim but not dark and a little table candle lighting goes a long way the walls are bricked but also halfplastered which along with the wooden floors and barrels might have caused the restaurant to veer off into the fauxrustic category but its handily saved from this mediocre fate by the elaborate goldpainted ceiling and more modern granite bar sala one nine is a classy place and it knows that it doesnt need to try to prove that to anyone birthday date special reason or casual get together this place has you coveredmy friend and i split a few dishes every one of which was flawless the baconwrapped almondstuffed dates were wonderful a salty slightly crispy exterior quickly yielded to a sweet creamy smooth interior a combination where each flavor and texture was readily identifiable and yet neither overpowered the other similar to how in less capable hands the dates could have been an exercise in decadence the meltinyourmouth fried goat cheese was accentuated with a generous drizzle of honey and cut with the more earthy sweetness of caramelized onions creating a dish that is a perfect example of the virtues of restraint by not overwhelming the palate the patatas bravas were fried perfectly and although that isnt too out of the ordinary the red pepper sauce that coated the potatoes was a fantastic combination of smooth and spicy which is rare and meant that we couldnt stop eating them even after eating these great tapas the seafood paella which arrives in a castiron pan managed to be a showstopper i wasnt aware it was possible to cook rice al dente but sala one nine did just firm enough on the outside but soft on the inside it was a pleasure to run each grain over my tongue and split it between my teeth furthermore the rice on the bottom of the pan had an even more awesome crispy texture and barelycharred taste as if that wasnt enough the use of saffron in this dish a flavor you can taste in every bite at once familiar yet foreign squarely elevated this dish into fivestar territory the seafood goes without sayingthe service was also great our waitress was timely knowledgeable and brought us a great bottle of red to drink with our meal however now that im reading the reviews im kicking myself for not getting the sangria p thats a musthave for next time the prices arent cheap but within the ranges you might expect of a tapas bar not too pricey eitheri feel that by their very nature tapas bars invite criticism because you order so many different dishes theres a high probability that while youll try some tapas that are excellent youll also try some that are mediocre or unappealing i think it speaks to the strength of sala one nine that every dish i had was wonderful when your food averages fourandahalf stars and everything else goes perfectly including a great atmosphere youve earned five stars not even i can argue with that
i think ive gone to heaven and it only cost me i noticed this was on the new on yelp list and decided to come try it out the noodles are not much to write home about but the dumplings are simply heavenlyyou order at the counter then sit down where ever there is a seat much like rest of chinatown decor is simple and old there are disposable chopsticks at the table and all sauces are in recycled sriracha bottles no names do just grab and guessthe dumplings are triangular shaped and when you bite in some soup lands in your mouth its the perfect mix of meat and veggies the dumpling skin is just thick enough to have great bitebtw you can take the frozen dumplings home as well for pieceslove this is what love feels like
thank you luke for plopping down this lobster heaven so close to my home i kinda hate you too because now whenever i am feeling lazy and dont know what to eat for a given meal my mind immediately dances over to the idea of a rich juicy buttery lobsta roll oh man oh man why then i either say damnit i dont need to spend bucks on lunch right now or i cave in im proud to say i have still tried to keep going to lukes a special treat reserved for splendid weather where i take my skooner boat to the waters edge and bask in the sunlight and say this is the good life one especially chilly day this spring when the weather dipped low in the i was craving a hearty savory soup it happened to be a sunday so both the original soupman and hale hearty were shuttered in this off peak ghost town twilight zone we call fidi weekends cue tumbleweed of cah blowing by howling wind sound effect and some maniacal banker sobbing up in his corporate office off in the distance the chanting of some ows drum circle contingent can still be heardneedless to say i was having the most frustrating time coming upon any decent soup within a block radius then that happy angel lobster that is always on my shoulder cleared his throat and said what about lukes i bet they have some kinda awesome chowdas down there and you know it will be qualitya buttery tear of joy fell down my cheek as i near sprinted to lukes there i not only found their menu mainstay new england clam chowder simmering away in a warm cauldron but also their soup of the day lobster bisque it was like music to my ears i said i would take both since clearly we were in some sort of soup depression at the moment and i needed to stock up the soups are pricey like liquid gold for the chowder for the bisque but oh are they worth it one of the best lobster bisques i have had in nyc hands down with giant hunks of lobster claw meat like the kind you get in their rolls i will always look to lukes now for my quality soup on a cold winters day so thankful luke has come to the neighborhood
summary deliciously unexpected fantastic service a must try for the neighborhoodthe atmosphere there is some outdoor seating but the windows in the main dining area allow for plenty of light the seating near the door is quite dark if you had a heavy night out and dont want to be near the sunlight tables are painted white which makes for a delightfully modern surfacethe crowd taboon is the type of place that reminds you that hells kitchen is gentrifying one of the trendier brunch spots for sure you can look nice here or you can come with morning face your choice if youre of the rainbow you will be pleasantly surprisedthe service we had a lovely new waiter by lovely i mean possibly one of the most perfect looking people ive seen in the city in a while he was so textbook good looking that even my straight bf admitted he was attractive as hes not my type and also im not convinced i had a better chance than my bf im sending out the love to the yelp community he works sunday brunch in case you are curious and want to see if hes single despite being brand new he was excellent and others in management checked in regularly to make sure we were up on coffee and the like the food yum wow i dont even really like hummus and i have to rave about the hummus and bread i had the crab benedict they used real crab meat the mixture with the spinach and hollandaise sauce was truly delightful i even quite liked the dressing on the salad there was a shrimp in a pan brunch dish was fantastic its smaller and you will want to dip the bread into the sauce in order to be full it was tasty enough that i didnt actually care that the portion size was smallish
this will be a long review so if youre looking for something short should you book the conrad yup and heres whyhospitality their customer service really cannot be beat smiles greet you all around and this freaked me out a bit every single person i passed at the front desk hallway etc knew my name and greeted me as i walked by this is before i gave them any sort of id and i did not have to give them any sort of introduction either i really made an impression during the booking process or this is just their specific attention to detail im going with the latter they catered to my every need and even went out of their way to predict my future needs so that i would not have to worry about them meeting space conference manager is super accommodating and the spaces are wellorganized and capable of fulfilling just about any meeting need highly recommended hotel rooms the hotel room reminds me of a comfortable studio space all of the tv screens in your hotel room will welcome you and all of the hotel staff are extremely accommodating prime location my river views were thoroughly enjoyed throughout my stay they have a really neat inroom dining ordering system where you can do it straight from the tv i added some special instructions to mine took a while and then it wouldnt allow me to do the checkout option so i ended up calling anyway but i like the idea now just tweak it to perfection conrad prime location next to the river nuff saidinroom dining everything was prepared to perfection except for the chai latte i ordered i ordered their farm fresh berries oatmeal and chai latte for breakfast berries were indeed farmfresh and the oatmeal was pretty good i specified delivery time and they rang at exactly with my food the chai latte arrived lukewarmcold and that kinda stank since i did not have a microwave to heat it back up

you ready to get fingered greeted by paul the super friendly and talkative owner of stickys finger joint this place is small yet spacious love the wall art decors which reminds me of a very hip tattoo parlor of some sort the low metallic tables and benches accompanied by red metal stools by the door seats around people there is a ledge on the side for those who would rather stand than sit as you reach the counter youll see a red television with a snowy screen and a rubbed on sticker with the joints name the very sweet lady harriet would take your order and she would answer any questions you have btw her accent is pretty cooltheir menu is a big mirror hung high behind the counter and it is inked with a marker after staring at the menu for quite some time i thought i was losing my eye sight because i began seeing double images i guess i was really hungry but turns out if i shifted my body weight and looked at it in different angle i can see normal again this was due to the reflection of the words im telling you this is what hunger does to onefor me i will always have a love for wasabi so when i saw wasabi chicken fingersi am sold yes ill trade your child in for some wasabi anytime i got the piece with wasabi aioli sauce yes ill even trade your kid in for some of this sticky sauce a white bbq sauce and chocolate chip bbq sauce i gotten this as a combo which is a pretty good deal because you add to your meal youll get a drink and a side i chose the purple sweet potato fries with a strawberry slurp on this foodie adventure how can hungry boy not be by my side well for him he got fingered alright yup thats right he got the straight up finger with sunny mustard sweet chili and the soy ginger sauces he also made his meal a combo and gotten the idaho truffle fries and a blue juiceour foods were delivered to our seats by the wonderful staff and as yelpers the first thing we do is major food paparazzi and making sure there was enough lighting and whatnot now its time to kick back and chomp the purple sweet potato fries were amazing they were topped with pecan dust and coconut flakes with honey drizzled on top this is pure genius and this just shows how much passion the owner has for coming up with something as delicious as this the truffle fries were crispy and very delicious too as we were sitting there paul comes over and we just kept chatting away as if hes been our buddy for years he was so sweet and awesome that he gave us a raw slaw which is cole slaw with chunks of avocado he also gave us a honey mustard sauce and another sticky sauce he was so awesome that he glitter bang my wasabi fingers and wasabi aioli sauce the wasabi fingers were so crispy and fried to perfection that i think im in lovewait i am in love and adding the wasabi aioli sauce it was indescribableif i have a kid ill trade it in too okay maybe not my kid but heck ill even trade hungry boy in the regular finger was really good too but with my strong love and desire for wasabi it would make the regular finger cry the raw slaw was fresh and delicious and this is coming from someone who isnt really a slaw fan i guess it does help with the avocado chunks as for the sauces my favorite one isyes you guessed it its the wasabi aioli the runner up for me is the sticky sauce and the sunny mustard sauce i loved the glitter asian spices so much that i had put some into the sticky sauce the strawberry slurp was not very sweet just the way i like it it reminds me of a liquify strawberry slush the blue juice was pretty good too also their drinks and sauces are all organic and made from natural ingredientspaul is such an interesting human being its his first time opening a restaurant and he just wants his staff to be themselves and be happy he never been to culinary school he just does this out of passion he also loves robots because he actually has some robots in the back from his childhood he took them out and started playing with them when there were these two little kids at the joint he greeted everyone that comes in and was so generous that he hit them up with sauces and drinks alright i realize the more i write this section sounds like a dating profile for paul haha except i forgot to mention he likes long walks on the beach with his robots and a basketful of chicken fingers and sauces i kid but hey who knows maybe he does like thati am glad that i was able to stop by and check out this new joint i heard they will have a rotating menu which i know ill definitely come back for more
yasuda has been the closest experience to sushi in japan outside of japan that i have encountered thus far the rice is exceptional and although it should go without saying at this point so is the quality of the fish as some of the prior reviews have stated this is not your fancy schmancy manhattan establishment dress nicely upscale casual but yasuda is not the place to show off your new louboutins if you prefer style over substance there are less pricey alternatives that can spare you from the atrocities of midtownlet me follow this review with a few sentences of ohmygodimsowonderful after reading most of you will want me to trip and fall on an hiv needle but no worries all selfpraising rants will all be over in update swift paragraphs clears throati lived in tokyo long enough to stop considering insert just about every usabased japanese restaurant name here to be anything other than a bastardized american version of japanese cuisine when you have grown accustomed to eating sushisashimi in the sushisashimi capital of the world therefor universe you ie me will undoubtedly notice yourself scrunching up your nose or rolling your eyes when someone starts telling you just how awesome that japanese takeout was and ohmygod nobu was so good ew author pauses to shudder at the horror of it allmeaning when i give yasuda a five star rating it is not because i am not familiar with sushi i am in fact perhaps too familiar with sushi in tokyo a person can walk outside of their door and nibble on something aquatic about seconds after it was bonked on the head with a blunt object or gutted with a knife no dinner at yasuda is not the same as breakfast at the tsukiji fish market if you want your tastebuds to encounter that uniquely japanese experience you are going to have to book the flight to narita and wake up at to get it expecting anything similar outside of japan is simply put delusional rant over
what a great find in the bronx well i guess it is not really a find as it seems that everyone knows about the place and when we got there early into dinner service on a saturday evening it was packedthe decor was upscale but still casual unlike many of the restaurants on this street has not been there for years the interior is sleek and fairly modern with a nice marble bar up front a long hall with a spacious dining room in the back the crowd was also different than the other establishment restaurants on arthur ave it was a young well dressed crowdnot to fear as the friendly hostesses took our name and suggested we have a drink at the bar the bar was jamming lots of people having predinner drinks when a large group got up from the bar for dinner we swooped in and grabbed some seats deciding to eat at the bar the bartender was great knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing we started of with drinks a glass of wine a nice heavy pour btw and a plymouth gin tonic the fact they have plymouth is unbelievable and wonderful at the same timewe started off with an appetizer of broccoli rabe which was amazing my wife got a trio of meat in a dish with a rich tomato sauce the meats were meatballs beef braciole and pork skin braciole she made short work of that dish she absolutely loved it i had one of their amazing neapolitan pizzas i ordered the margarita and added sausage it was absolutely fantastic the sauce and cheese were delicious but the crustohhhh the crust chewy and crusty all at the same time people like to drone on and on about how good average at best imo nyc pizza is etc the pizza at is way ahead of almost any other pizza in nyc no questions askedour dining experience was incredible from start to finish i cant wait to go back
this place is tiny tables to the right of the restaurant and stools at the bar best to come alone during lunch hours or with a friend who youll probably enjoy eating withthe menu is adorable and so informational with cute illustrations if you want cold soba or hotor veggie it tells you which page to skip to loves it i ordered the sesame soba under vegetarian it came with a dipping sauce cucumber slices sesame seeds and the soba noodles i didnt know eating soba noodles involved a handson experience i felt like a complete fool when the cook handed me a tray with a bowl of sesame seeds with a grinding tool a saucer with the cucumber slices and a cup with some type of liquid i immediately googled how to eat cold soba noodles until the server came back and explained what i needed to do how sweet so apparently you grind the sesame seeds sooo fun and afterwards sprinkle them on your noodles with the cucumber slices and dip the noodles in your dipping sauce and chow down according to google dont over soak your noodles otherwise you wont be able to taste the delicateness of the soba also it says to eat immediately after you soak them ini got the regular size and felt that it was such a small portion until the server came around with a tiny kettle and gave me a little information sheet on what sobayu was and how to have it after youre done with the dipping sauce you pour hot water into it and sip it like soupit will look like miso soup surprisingly it was a nice sized mealeverything about this place is cutefrom the cooks that you can see in the tiny open kitchen the tiny basket they bring the bill in the business cards loveeeps cash only

i get it theres a lot of hype about ippudo and the insane wait times can lead to unrealistically high expectations but after eating my way through many ramen spots in the city i still come back to ippudo time and again the key standouts are the pork buns seriously amazing and the ramen broth making this my preferred ramen noshing localepork buns are simple fatty pork belly slices per bun with iceberg lettuce zingy mayo and soft doughy slightly sweet buns with a squirt of sriracha you get buns per order and i frequently find that each person needs hisher own orderthe ramen broth is amazingly smoky and complex i definitely recommend for your first time getting the akamaru modern and then later branching out into their other flavors like the wasabi ramen the decor is surprisingly sophisticated subtle touches of color and patterned clothes mosaics made out of sequins and dark wood make up the palate once you are whisked inside away from the madness of the crowded lobby the restaurant itself is spacious and doesnt feel crowded be prepared to potentially share a table but as soon as your steaming bowl of ramen gets set down in front of you all youll think about is slurping as quickly as possible without burning your mouth
call me a simpleton but the fish sandwich is honestly one of my favorite foods while the delicious concoction can be found on menus from restaurants like mcdonalds to wannabe seafood havens like red lobster i find that the best fish sandwiches come from tucked away hideaways like devinsnow call me a fool but for years i did not even know that devins existed i was drawn away by the allure and expensiveness of famous down the streetonce i tasted devins howeveri was soldrusty and i walked upon devins one afternoon after work with some cash on us they dont take cards we decided to give the holeinthe wall establishment a go when we got there there were not many people waiting to be served after placing our order for one fish sandwich and an order of shrimp and chips we sat towards the back and waited to be called up to pick up our foodwe must have arrived at just the right time because right after taking a seat in the back of the narrow and dimly lit eatery a barage of clientele came in shouting out tons of different orders calamari potato salad fried plantains large fish and chips with lemonade commuters neighbors school children they all paraded in on the friday afternoon demanding their tasty seafood fare thankfully we got our order in before the rush and although we did have to wait a little while we were eventually beckoned for our giant servings of foodnestled between two pieces of split top wheat bread three pieces of golden fried whiting were waiting for me i slathered the sandwich with spicy hot sauce and cool refreshing tartar sauce to compliment it the rest was history the sandwich was perfect the best fish sandwich that i had ever hadthe fish fry was perfect not too salty and the fish was so meaty and moist i ate every biterustys shrimp was also delicious and his fries were homemade also the portions were gigantic and for a price cheaper than famousit also makes famous clientele look like fools i dont think that i have to tell you although i live around the corner from famous i havent spent a dime there since discovering devinsand yes while the service can be terribly slow appreciate that everything is grilled fried or broiled to order the staff is also very friendly and honest the plantains are delicious the fried food is never greasy or salty and i cant wait to try the famous delicious potato saladim hooked

spanish harlem has for many years held it down as the place for good mexican food and this place was part of why cafe ollin has been open for at least three years and i used to go regularly at lunch and find the place deserted i loved the food the friendly owner who also took orders and helped cook plus the nofrills holeinthewall vibe the place exuded yet i often worried the place wouldnt survive as id see so few customers come in after leaving a job i had around the corner i stopped coming by and just revisited for the first time in over two years thankfully the place has survived and although i never had come for dinner it was my lunch spot it seems like business is great there were four or five chefs at work plus a waitress and a cashier a far cry from the days when it was just the owner and one guy in the kitchen to see this business doing well was heartwarmingas for the food i used to come here for the burritos and tortas which are always huge and always delicious this place uses the best ingredients and prepares their beans rice and meats well i would highly recommend a torta de carne enchilada or a cemita with the same meat the carnitas or pollo asado burritos are also deliciouson my most recent trip however being as it was dinner i opted for my favorite dish and the one i measure mexican restaurants by enchiladas i was not disappointed although different than those from my native new mexico they still had everything i wanted in a good enchilada they were smothered in spicy green chili covered with raw onions sour cream and parmesanlike cheese and stuffed with tasty chicken needless to say i cleared my platemy girlfriend had the chorizo cemita and loved it but still could only finish one half another friend order the barbacoa de res and devoured it briskly the spicy red chili smothered over large chunks of meat more resembled the carne adovada we make back home but it looked so good im going to have to go back to try it myselfone final comment i long advocated for el paso and still enjoy the food there but this place surpasses it in terms of flavor quality of service price and humilityel paso has opted to be the choice of the gentrifying elements of el barrio but this place aspires only to survive and provide delicious food this should be at the top of ever nyers restaurant lists
nestled inside the ace hotel is the breslin an english inspired gastropub that along with albert hall is rapidly changing my perception of these establishments this is no greasy spoon but instead underneath its exterior of pig sculptures old kitchy items and dark wood is an eatery and bar that takes both its food and drink seriously ive only hung out at the bar so far but that seems to be a good area to chill with friends or just by yourselfthe staff is very friendly and if time allows very open to engaging in conversation the place can get crazy busy at times so if youre dining in a reservation may be in ordermy first experience with the breslin involved its cocktails heres a rundownforbidden fruit a mix of brandy bitters citrus and ginger beer this is a rather mild tasting drink but it sneaks up on you like a wine would this would probably be good to have with foodrush of blood to the head prosecco blood orange and more this is my favorite drink its sweet but packs a punch to back up the sweetness i think i downed three of these and was really nicely buzzed on one visitliquid swords whiskey chartreuse curacao this thing is pure liquor and it packs an insane punch a very manly drink with dark flavors that you really have to nurseand what about food they do that pretty darn amazingly tooseafood sausage made by the restaurant this concoction includes fish and lobster inside a sausage on a wonderful cream sauce with some greens it was amazing and i instantly wanted another the sausage has a great chew and with the greens and sauce its pure winfrittata with ricotta cheese beautiful in presentation with tons of cheese on top this thing is super rich so have a drink handy to help wash it down french fries thick cut deliciously crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside these are served with a cumin mayo that makes your mouth singi cant wait for my next visit to this awesome place
granted id had an emotionally vulnerable day and i was likely to be enamored of any great meal especially alongside my darling friend of years briefly in town from the left sidewe were treated as both royalty and like old friends complete with stories about regulars light medical history our gentle servers halfmarathon time the day before i solicited all these stories im sure they automatically come with neither the buttery miso cod cooked in yuzu over low heat for hours nor with the gigantic tray of perfectly transparent sensational iberian ham with tomato toastalam opened new bottles of wine to pour our glasses which we left him to thoughtfully select for us oh my sweet tiny baby jesus i just remembered i forgot to tell you about the amuse bouche in a huggably warm large shot glass were three perfect layers to start dinner creamy foie dark purple port and parmesan foam on top which managed to be the lingering subtlest flavor that i marveled in stunned silence while our second course was chilled white asparagus soup surely inspired by mir√≥ centered with a garlicky tomato dollop generous caviar on a creme fraiche pillow at oclock a couple other colored dots of flavor here and there and the two most pungent microbasil leaves ive ever yes three unannounced starter courses raw hamachi tightly cuddling mashed avocado improved a thousand times by julienned mint leaves and citrus vinaigrette sour notes biting through every half second or so this was my friends favorite bite of the nighti think we were talking more about which cast members in newsies were cast from sytycd over the second appetizer course creamy asparagus soup over lobster trumpet mushrooms and cashews and perfect perfect spaghetti with razor clams and roasted tomatoesgod is good and the chefs were kind to give us a fiveminute respite before the main course his wagyu with wasabi spinach was perfect to behold but i was too full to try it i barely had two nibbles of my vealchickenham pate but its perfectly wrapped in a four seasons box in my fridge and something tells me itll make good leftoversi hope im doing an adequate job communicating how incredible it all was because it was one of the finest meals ive had emotional vulnerability notwithstandingof course the gracious chef came out to say hello before dessert tart yogurt sorbet and prickly pear preceded our our heavenly chocolate tendance which of course was accompanied with another unrequested treat a bubble of shiny blown sugar filled with elderflower cream and pineapple sorbet of course my espresso had a foamy smile on top the meal queued a happy playlist to sing in my head as i walked home on a perfect night in my perfect town feeling more grateful for everything
if youve never been on one of the tenement museum tours i encourage you to try one out yes they are a pop but it is absolutely money well spentat least one of the tours is a living history tour your guide is in character and in costume however this is not true of all the tours so its best to check in advance please also check their website to see what floor each tour is on i mention this because there are no elevators personally i hoof it up flights of stairs at least once a day because i live in a walkup but walking up to a floor apartment isnt for everyone if youre bringing small children someone with bad knees or heart problems you might want to aim for a tour that explores an apartment on lower floor this is what i did when i brought my mom who had finally recovered from a dislocated ankle going to the floor was doable going to the floor not so muchthe amount of history that the guides cram into each tour complete with documents from actual former residents of of the apartments and often with audio recordings of conversations etc is amazing you learn so much and it is not at all dry or tedious you get a real sense of how it was to live in the tenements and what challenges the residents faced as immigrants on both tours i attended every single person was completely focused on the guide both times i left wanting to immediately do an another tour that same day and would have if i hadnt already had plans mapped out for the daythe tenement museum experience has both times been an utter delight and i plan to eventually do each tour that is offered two thumbs up more if i had more than two thumbs
great melkors ghost this place is amazing one look at the bartenders beard and i knew this was the onefinding the door is easy first of all theres a doorman on the remote chance that he isnt there the door says vault in large print i almost wish this place was harder to find because they change the music to top forty stuff whenever the bar is crowded which isevery weekend and as much as id like to society frowns on people drinking on tuesdays there goes listening to duke ellington and swilling bourbon its ok vault i love you anyway i hope losing at pfaffs and the isnt too forwardthe waitresses look like ringmasters the menu is folded like a newspaper and the cocktails are sixteen dollars but its somehow not pretentious you get the typical we arent thirty yet i promise watch me bro it up as proof suit and tie crowd but i got the sense that nothing could take away from the laid back yet elegant vibe of the place its a feeling a bar achieves from being the genuine article not a cheesy mad menesque caricature we came for the yelp drinks special but i could honestly say that ill go again sans special because its worth it the subway rumble was my favorite drink of the night mostly because i like scotch but everything we tried was phenomenal our waitress was also incredibly knowledgeable helpful and accommodating when she talked me into trying the bohemian she checked with me multiple times after i received it assuring me that if it was too sweet she would happily take it off our tab and bring something else the leaves of grass actually came with a piece of grass which we tried using as a stirrer somewhat effectively it was probably the strongest tasting drink of the night but it was still balanced and eminently enjoyable the ada clare was a little sweet for me but it was perfect for her our waitress talked me out of getting a melkors ghost even though i was ordering it for the name maybe next timei could talk about this place for much longer than this review warrants so ill sum this up by saying places like this make me thankful for prohibition hats off to you volstead act i like to think that after his attempted veto was overridden woodrow had a glass or two hereim so wearing a cardigan next time

i love death well not literally that is but i could turn into a thanatophile just for death companyi finally came back to death company following a brief rendezvous over the summer after the infamous yelp ice cream crawl during that visit i did not drink and barely ate anything as i was stuffed with a calories worth of dairy products boy did i make up for that mistake with this weeks indulgence of drinks and dinner now i feel like i can give it the proper review it deservesso in all honesty i had scheduled to go to milkhoney that night with friends but they had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances determined to go out and show off my new dress that i had just bought the day before i called on a backup buddy we decided to head somewhere were we could eat and drink and have a catchup conversation i was very adamant about going to a speakeasy so death company seemed perfect as i was reminded by a fellow yelper how amazing the bites are herewhen you first arrive at death co you should be greeted by a man outside donning an outfit that gives a nod to the old styles suspenders fitted trousers button down shirt homburg hat something of that nature hell ask you how many is in your party and alert you to a wait time if theres any note one time i stopped by on a saturday night around oclock and i was informed that the wait time would be hours yikes this time around the bar had not yet gotten completely full so he guided me into the dark lit room to a booth on my right there i waited for my company to show up as i pored over the menu in the flickering candlelight while waiting i looked upon the room from my corner and watched the bartenders hastily at work shaking and mixing drinks as orders came in from thirsty patrons in front of him i was amused by how inbetween his arm workouts the bartender within my line of sight was happily conversing with those at the bar i love down to earth bartenders major pointsafter a few minutes of waiting i decided to go ahead and order a drink there are so many drink options to choose from from the menu that making a final selection can be quite difficult i chose to have the death from above as it was a rum based drink i could not tell you now even with a gun to my head what the other ingredients were as the words were pretty much all alien to me shortly thereafter i received my death from above from the waitress i took one sip and hello im drunk drinks here are definitely on the pricier end but you have to remember two things this is a speakeasy not your normal bar and they are freaking strong as in can start a car strong unless youre looking to get plastered or acquire a dui i wouldnt have more than one of these bad boys within an hour sip dont glugmy friend arrived and quickly ordered her signature manhattan straight up to catch up with me im not a huge fan of manhattans but she said hers was very well made ill take her word for it after debating on what to pick from the bites menu i would have ordered everything if i could afford it we picked a solid compilation of choices now unfortunately for me this friend of mine doesnt eat mammals so the filet mignon crispy pork belly and lamb chops would sadly have to wait until my next visit that certainly wont be a problem though as i am anxiously figuring out now on when to returnour selections for the eveningbeet salad baby beets and candied ginger slivers mixed with sliced almonds and goat cheese great melange of textures and flavors i adore a good beet salad so simple yet so delicioustruffle macaroni aged cheddar and truffle bread crumbs the presentation of the mac and cheese wasis brilliant it is brought out to you in individual serving spoons on a platter so perfect for a group the macaroni was superb creamy and the breadcrumbs gave it that extra little oomph with texture crab cakes crab cakes served with balsamic vinegar reduction sauce our least favorite of the night but still ok i didnt like the accompanying salsa it didnt compliment the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar reduction which was heavenlytuna tartar with crushed avocado and homemade kettle chips mmm fabulous tuna tartar definitely recommend itlobster brioche rolls with crunchy jicama apple and fennel slaw interesting spices but yummy with big pieces of lobster meat overall great service food and drinks our waters were constantly refilled and our waitress made sure we were satisfied throughout our tenure i cant wait to return to death co to try more of their amazing liquid concoctions and attack the mammals on the bites menu death is calling mealso im just throwing this out there these next words are for the cute guy working the front door monday night in the pink shirt if youre straight and single i was the brunette in the leopard print dress that evening rawr

you know its a good sign when you havent even gotten through the hors doeuvres and you feel like youve already had the best meal of your lifeseriously they need to serve a straw with every dish so that you can suck up every morsel and drop of sauce from every possible nook and cranny the flavour combinations were so nuanced and poignant that i cannot stop thinking about them sea urchin cappuccino with green apple and crab outstanding the showstopping flavours were also littered with a prevailing sense of well coordinated playfulness their take on the clam bake was part performance as hot water was poured over hot stones and seaweed releasing the aroma of the sea as you enjoy a delightful series of preparations of clams and lobster however it was really the deceptively smooth clam chowder that warmed inconspicuously on the hot stones that reminded us that the most simple thing can often be the most deliciousanother highlight was the guinea fowl which was handsdown one of the most tender preparations i have ever experienced sousvided and then roasted each bite of buttersoft fowl made me almost forget that there was a superbly piece of seared foie waiting on the sidebut speaking of foie the foie terrine was breathtaking the intense creaminess of the terrine was balanced beautifully by the sweet and crunch of the surrounding crisp i swear i thought i almost shed a tear with each bite i took realizing that it was only bringing me closer to the end of that dishbut these are just a few of the highlights of the tasting menu which was still full of other amazing dishes such as lobster lasagna potato gnocchi and goat cheese and beet lollipops just to name a few the entire tasting menu was so beautifully crafted i dont see how i could come back and not want to do it all over againwhat i would also be remiss if i failed to mention was also the amazing wine pairings not only were we served the most amazing wines but i loved how they also brought into play a great belgian beer the smoothest sake i have ever experienced and an uberlush glass of madeira wine and every single pairing fantasticwhat more can i say the one thought that did come to mind was how does this compare to per se one one hand the presentations and portions did not feel as grand as per se and you do not get completely flooded with as many sweets and chocolates at the end of the meal but i felt that the flavours and execution were absolutely on par the service was just as spectacular and there were certainly moments of brilliance in their food when i thought they convincingly out shone their more expensive counter partbut i do not want to take away from emp with comparisons it is an absolutely outstanding restaurant a dining experience that you will not easily forget and will want to relive soon and soon again and yes im pretty stoked that emp got to be my review
i usually get my banh mi not bahn mi fix at saigon the chinatown joint is good but they are nothing compared to xe may since i have always love pork on my sandwiches i had to try the super cub classic it is the first listed item on their sandwiches menu and is made up of barbecued pork pork roll headcheese and pate with daikon radish pickled carrot cucumber fresh cilantro spicy mayonnaise jalapeno black pepper and optional srirachathe meats were moist and incredibly tasty the fact that it was not too greasy made it even better it was different from the traditional meat and i liked how they were thinly sliced and encased by the perfectly toasted baguette i love the crunchiness of the fresh bread because it was really savory and yet it wasnt too hard to scrape the top of my mouth believe it or not the crumbs flew out of my mouth during each bite i actually felt sorry for the people that had to clean up my messeven though the sandwiches are a good size and adequate enough to fulfill a lunch or dinner appetite i would love to see a higher meattobread ratio in the future must try the whole wheat baguette as well which was sold out during my visit cant get enough of meat and fiberwith all due respect to the traditional banh mi the best sandwiches these days are the ones with a variety of creative flavors you can find them here for those of you who love newstyle banh mi sandwiches this is the place to bexe may deserves for the great food at the right price with awesome service i would definitely come back to try the tacos salads sides and the exotic drinks and of course the yummy sammies

in the years my girlfriend and i have been dating shes mentioned a handful of times how we should grab dinner here this coming from a person whose last meal would consist of steamers raw oysters and a quality brew finally we got reservations this past weekend i always thought gimmicky name on the ues side ehhh probably a forgettable dinner when its all said and done well i was wrong like i usually amso we were seated on a busy saturday night right in the middle portion of the restaurant i was facing a mural of a beach scene with a few fisherman and in mural these two fisherman were speaking to me the entire night we start off with some raw rhode island oysters after slurping them all up and feeling a seafood buzz coming on apparently i could of sworn these two fisherman said great choice and we just picked those today without a doubt some of the freshest oysters ive had in nyc later i go with the mussels with the maine broth which consisted of lobster smoked bacon chowder and parsley if you were like me and its your first time just do yourself a favor and get this variety yes they have a whole page of different varieties but i think this one is the way i mussel broth should taste plus once you polish of the actual mussels you can dig out the chunks of bacon and lobster and munch on those so two beers deep and half way through i could of sworn these two fishermen winked at me nodded and one whispered delicious aint it also be a boss and get the truffle fries if you get the standard fries you deserve a good smack ahhhh the grand finale the donuts first off time to throw that new years resolution out the window these donuts are the truth even if you dont have a sweet tooth you will like these so just order some i split with my girlfriend all were warm sweet and outrageously delicious if youre like me and prefer sweets over fruit flavors go with the fluffernutter and salted caramel huge props to the georgia peach flavored one tooother noteslegit beer listattentive service even on a busy nightreasonable prices for amazing seafoodtime to ditch that friday or saturday date with that person youre probably not even gonna score with and make reservations here for dinner and do yourself right ah reservations a definite must on the weekend unless you like being nuttobutt with other folks oh yeah if you get a glimpse of those two fishermen in the mural tell them i say wattup
hands down the absolute best investment i have made in over a decade this school rocks and trust me its not for the weak so knowing that you ought to trust in the fact that you get every pennys worth by studying here some people have accused krav maga conditioning to be subpar these people obviously have never studied krav maga and especially not at this school because here the opposite is truethe instructors are clearly all exisraeli army which by default makes them absolute bad asses that know exactly what theyre doing theyre very cool and patient teachers too above all theys good teachers theyre very easy to learn from their teaching methods are totally fluid and comprehensibleeach class starts out by breaking you down with military style physical training once you get accustomed to these youll be in the shape of your life believe it the second part of each class includes fully hands on real life combat and fighting situations and techniques strong emphasis on real life krav maga is full contact you will be trained to defend yourself in the real world without a doubt as the english say no pussyfooting around herei started this class with a group buying deal but i knew after just the second class i was hooked i love the pain i love the skills picked up i love the total confidence krav maga adds to my life ive been a full time student here going into my third month my recommendation do not bother waiting for some stupid deal to come around come now and try your first class out for free and trust me that you will be hookedthe krav maga school is strong like america do it
who would have thought id thoroughly enjoy a meal with of us outside crowded around a single school desk inspired by the screening of fela outside the adam clayton powell state building we moseyed on over to the shrine for some food as we walked in a band was playing and sadly my companions were a bit turned off by the volume and probably the sound on its own and decided to eat outside instead i however was thoroughly digging the band playing and wished we had stayed inside however it was loud enough to have been difficult to heartalk which was the point of our convening there was such an interesting and eclectic crowd there i agree with that assessment other reviewers i literally saw a crew of kids that looked like a united colors of benetton version of a kid n play movie or the tv show a different world hightop fades dookey chains shoulder pads and all it was amazing also the best part i had the best fried chicken ive ever had in nyc i went in on that chicken no lie to the power im morally opposed to the idea of chicken wings too why would i want to eat a bone with some strands of chicken on it you can take that elsewhere drumsticks or bust but it was pretty bomb and to make it even better i could get my chicken with a side of fried plantain shrine are you trying to steal my heart because you have it is yours xoxo the service was good too to boot i definitely want to make my way back there another night for a my chicken fix and b to partake in the imbibing and hear the live music seems theres often bands there of different musical flavours afropunk afrobeat jazz reggae etc which is rawesome it generally just seems like a super cool place to hang with your posse or perhaps to recruit folks for a posse which im trying to do inquire if youre interested all the cool kids in harlem hang out at the shrine so get on the bandwagon
one of the best donuts ive had in my life let me sum it creme brulee inches in diameter with a crispy thin crust of sugar surrounding the perimeter of the donut with a nice creamy inside absolutely dulce de leche donut a round donut with a hole but they still manage to have some nice dulce de leche creme inside the donut almost as delicious as the aforementioned donut
i am obsessedi eat out all the time mostly because im too lazy to cook but also because i love finding new places since i eat the majority of my meals in brick and mortal locations other than my abode im finding that more and more things are pretty good and not excellent because i just think i am over saturated with restaurants mealsi can already see that this review might make no sense i guess thats what happens when you fall in love i kept hearing about maialino and of course felt like i was the last to try it this is the story of my life i went for dinner with a coworker on a wednesday night we both wanted to try something new and this was halfway between her apartment and mine the bar was packed and the wait was a half hour thats okay with me for dinner by the time we get a round of drinks and chat for a few times up and we are being seated thats pretty much exactly what happened we got kier royales at the bar because champagne seemed like a good choice at the time once we were seated we switched to wine and liked whatever white the server suggested she was friendly nice nonintrusive and informative ohsogood at her job love that already we looked over the menu and wanted to try a little bit of everything but our wallets cried for help and we settled on appetizers and dinner i started with the baccala its a pretty traditional italian dish and executed well can be pretty amazing baccala is salted cod lightly battered and fried it should be delicate flavorful and crispy maialino made all those things come true for an entree i decided on the ravioli special which was a potato puree with spinach and parmesan inside one enormous ravioli was delivered to my table i was actually a little disappointed i wanted more than one who do these people think they are dont they know a hungry girl when they see one but the ravioli was incredibly filling surprisingly so success i liked this place so much that i returned that same week for sunday brunch with my mom she was coming into town for brunch and said she wanted to try something new maialino was still in my head from the amazing dinner i had so i booked up the last we wound up ordering a ton of food she wanted to try everything like i had at dinner my mom is good like that we italians just cant get enough we started with the baccala because i told her how delicious it was and its one of her favorites then we had fried artichokes with anchovy bread sauce and i feel like i would have snacked on those all day you might be thinking that we stopped there with the brunch appetizers no such luck we are either awesome or disgusting i think awesome we then ordered the toffee glazed brioche because it was brunch after all oh my goodness gracious that was incredible i could have eaten of them we then order main courses because to reiterate we are awesome and i asked for the poached eggs with brussel sprouts and buttercup squash that dish was the best brunch dish i have ever had i adore both brussel sprouts and squash of all types and this dish was perfectly savory i dont even have the words to tell you about it basically you have to go there and order it for yourself yeah its that good they even had a dessert menu for brunch can you believe that i literally couldnt eat one more thing i felt like i might explode it was touch and go there for a while a while back i wrote about how much i love clinton street baking company for brunch now i love this place just as much and they have more tables take reservations and credit cards and is much closer to my apartment thank you gramercy park hotel for spoiling me to the fullest with maialino im only sorry it took me so long to try it here
i had never told anyone to shut up while i was eating because i needed to revel in the ecstasy of my food until nowthe strip house easily has the best steak ive had in years served with roasted garlic and a variety of amazing sides my new york strip steak was mouthwateringly delicious allllll by itself i literally have no words to describe it other than perfect which is what i told my friend when he tried to distract me from my dinner with his meaningless yapping the strip house experience begins when you open the door into a big red room that is reminiscent of the with its plush wallpaper red leather seats and blackandwhite photos there are small lampshades on every table sheltering a candle which adds to the romantic ambiance the optional sides range from black truffle creamed spinach to green beans to french fries and everything i tasted was incredible literally everything even the appetizers were worth reviewing we got two specials oysters on the halfshell and a beautiful salad of yellow and red tomatoes mozzarella and a homemade vinaigrette we paired our meal with a spanish red wine and were both impressed by the expansive and expensive wine list for dessert we tried baked alaska which amazingly i had never tried before chocolate cake smothered with ice cream surrounded by a meringue that tastes like toasted marshmallows yes please thank you very much and may i please come here for dinner every night for the rest of my life
craft beer heaven its more of a store instead of bar but they also constantly have different beers on tap that you can try in the store one flight small beers is there are a few small tables in the back corner or you can stand and have your beers on the island in the center of the store this is not a place to come for happy hour or really even to just sit and chill just come to try some unique beers or to pick up that rare beer you cant find at the store down the street any beer you can think of they most likely carry if youre waiting to be seated at a restaurant nearby might not even be a bad place to kill some time with cheap drinks
ive been a regular at jwf for awhile but avoided writing a review for the following fear that my fans might decide to infiltrate the place and ruin my chances at a bar side my probations officer would not like the idea that i asked bartender drew for a framed picture of himself surfing i would actually have to think about how much of my time i spend there spoiler alert its a lotnow that im officially the duchess takes bow i feel that its time i share the magic that is jones woods foundrynestled in the heart of the ues this candle lit gastropub is the perfect place for a cozy night out unlike the fratbarmess surrounding the spot this bar attracts a slightly older after work crowd owner rob has hired an amazing cast of characters who are both friendly and worldly and who also have a high tolerance for antics when im sober enough to enjoy the food i have never been disappointed the tuna tartar is the best ive ever had the pleasure of knowing and the authentic meat pies are delicious and warm the stomach id also like to the time to shout one out to the brussels sprouts and the burger both whom are fan favorites ive noticed some complaints about the price and while im pretty sure im putting bartender jeremy through grad school i find the prices to be fair and completely reasonable for the quality of the food and drink so if you happen to see me there being creepy with manager hot stu make sure to say hi we will definitely invite you to the weddingshameless name dropthey have accents and are ridiculously attractive

two little red hens hens on walls hens on tables hens on tshirts on walls we sat down at a hen table and worked on our cupcakes as we conversed about life and happenings moist red velvet with just the right amount of smooth cream cheese frosting coffee was perfect with the carrot cupcake they were just the right size at the end of the night we became two fat hens with red velvet and carrot in our tummies yummy
this is by far one of the most oddly decorated places ive ever seen its so drab i thought it was a bank from the outside inside is an exercise in minimalist art unadorned cement walls and a complete lack of tables and chairs thats sort of weird because they dont lack space they have quite a lot of it in fact two people could have an epileptic seizure in the middle of their store and not ever hit a wall or each other maybe even three but the gelato honey lavendar honey lavendar baskin robbins would have ruled the world if only they had that flavorps cash only visas will get you a funny look and no ice cream

i love it here walked in on a friday having been scared off of our original destination by a loud large crowd stayed for the next hours with friends coming and going many rounds of food and beverage enjoyed and friends made with the lovely staff throughout the evening highlights include the options for seating with a long bar a few easy tables up front and a large dining area in the back there is a lot to choose from and all lit with soft oldstyle bulbs that make everyone look cute the menu is varied and localish with standouts in the grilled cheese fried pickles shrimp salad sliders and im sure many other things we didnt have time to try prices on food were a fair for appetizers for entrees if i have one minor complaint its that some plates from the same sections had very different portion sizes such that i envied my friends shrimp salad and wondered where the rest of my beets were mixed drinks were great the bartender flexible and happy to please beer selection was also a hit and happy hour provided us ample opportunity to feel as if we were saving money and had choices on how to do so to boot money which we then clearly spent on countless treats after the oclock witching hour passedseriously if you like feeling as if youve discovered something wonderful while at the same time realizing you feel as if you are in your favorite neighborhood spot come to sit with friends and talk for hours or to go on a hot date with sexy lighting enjoy a delicious meal or just pop in for a good stiff drink you should go to pour george stat its easily a new favorite in the west village and one ill search out in the very near future
who travels from les to harlem for a little soul food i do my roommate and i wanted to try something new so we took a little trip up to lenox ave and found a spot that was still serving a late lunch our first attempt was red rooster but their lunch service stopped at sylvias is not only a restaurant but her brand is also widely recognized in supermarkets for her canned food recipes and famous hot saucelooking over the menu with so many different soul food options it was extremely hard for me to choose one but maybe even a couple of different plates while we were making up our mind our server brought over cornbread the smell of the delicious bread made us devour it so fast the basket was empty before the server returned to take our order instead of ordering when she returned we handed over the basket and asked for another serving of cornbread first lol i had the smothered dark meat chicken with candied yams and delicious cheesy mac and cheese my roommate had the fried chicken with black eyed peas and mac and cheese you could tell we were hungry because we almost licked our plates clean in under five minuteswhat a great choice we made and we will definitely be returning here again soon
this place is ridiculously good i am baffled as to how loesers still exists after such a huge demographic shift in the bronx over the last years i guess its a testament to the quality of the food and the steadfastness of the owner who has ensured that all of the the jewish classics he makes are still top quality and made with great care this is one of those under the radar places that doesnt get the accolades that katzs the ave deli and barney greengrass do but loesers is absolutely in the same league if not the best out of all of themlunch was about for and included sandwiches soups cole slaw pickles and drinks a bit pricey for the area but youre getting some of the best jewish food anywherewithout a doubt this is a five star jewish deli worth a special trip up to the bronx
honestly im suprised the line was not longer ralphs has the word famous in the title like many establishments but this one is truly deserved im still astonished at the amount of delicious treat you get for a measly pricea symphony of flavor for a hot daythey have all the necessary items a small frozen treat stand should have but the menu is most important in its flavors of ice and milk varieties both are tasty and perfect for a hot day but it simply baffles me i might have mentioned this already how they can give you so much for so little money i would expect an inferior product but that is nowhere close to what you are served im glad there is now a location that does not require my travel to staten island or long island
being a craft beer connoisseur i was floored when walking by the other day and discovering this enclave of malt and hops shelves upon shelves of craft style beers ciders and hard to find imports are all on hand to try out and enjoy in fact when asking the owner how many they actually carry he replied close to stouts porters ales high alcohol content ohhhh myyyyyi shed a tear and hugged himoh who am i kidding i just love to drink good beer being the lush that i am city swiggers is a godsend that has taken up residence in yorkville ues its an area that desperately needs more unique shops such as this and that are slowly but surely popping up in once empty store fronts that dot the area no more heading downtown below street or to brooklyn to find a quality beer retailer as this location fulfills all beer consumption needs it makes perfect sense for city swiggers to put up shop here as this area is known as one of the most densely populated residential parts of the city street has seen a boom in name brand retail stores open recently and when the ave subway is finally finished will end up bringing in even more businesses and shoppers this wayi could see they are already having some success judging by the amount of people coming in and purchasing all types of beers while i was there up front there is a large communal wooden tasting table surrounded on one side by a large shelving unit stocked full with amazing craft beers and on the other side refrigerated units filled to the brim with cold tasty goodness people were milling all about choosing beers to take home some grabbing a cold brew to consume there and others looking to sample one of the beers on tap yes craft beers on tap that will rotate every few weeks all around a pint very eclectic selection to choose from and free tastings if you want to check out your palate before choosing one the husband and wife owners were very nice and chatted with me for quite a while and also let me try a few before i settled on a terrific glass of innis gunn rum cask deliciousshe also told me the demand has been so overwhelming that they are having trouble keeping some of the beers in stock that is a good problem as it shows people have found out about this great store and are shopping there as they are fairly new some kinks need to be worked out but that is expected be patient and support these great local businessesthey also have growlers to purchase at deposit for the bottle and then cost is determined by what beer you fill it up with so much more convenient than schlepping downtown to pick up and refill a growler and worth the cost for convenience i did have a chance to notice and compare individual bottle prices on the craft beers and found them to be quite fair if even pretty inexpensive overall the cider and hard to find import section in the back of the store has some really keen selections and is pretty impressive as many i had never seen beforethe store itself is well lit has a nice relaxed retail vibe and also has a decent amount of seating tables to sit at and enjoy your beer purchase they need to put on some background music at a low level though but that is a minor flaw this is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and i hope they are around for a long time go yorkville go yorkville
one again tom colicchio impresses me the first and most prominent quality i noticed about this restaurant was the woodsy d√©cor it flourishes throughout the venue from the wood burning fire place in the caf√© to the wall of stacked fire logs it really puts you right there where the designer wants you to be back to nature wellmaybe a trendier and more expensive nature the service was outstanding i cannot stress it any more from the moment we walked in hostess to the moment we left servers all staff everyone seemed happy to be working there and happy to serve i felt like a guest in someones home we had a large party of and there was probably staff for our table main server and runnersbussers they brought all of our entrees out at once so nobody was left waitingi love when restaurants do this they were friendly and were attentive to our empty glasses of winewait were our glasses ever emptythe food it was incredible and unique we shared appsa mixture between the sweet bread by far the besthad i known it was pig intestine i would have not eaten it ahi tar tar hamachi and risotto for my entr√©e i had the scallops which were fresh with a mixture of woodsy earthy flavorsagain tying in with the restaurants overall theme i mean you cant really go wrong with mr colicchioit was a pretty pennybut one of those meals where you gladly hand over your amex and say worth it worth every penny a true genuine dining experience
good afternoon id like to buy the whole store yes the whole store all the macarons the melon pan the ice cream just put it all in a big take out container oh and would you throw in one of those lovely napoleons too everything i tried here was delicious i tried a really unique wasabi bread which seemed oily but really added to the subtle hint of wasabi it wasnt spicy but refreshing in an odd way the melon pan was sweet on top and slightly chewy and delightful my hands down favorite has got to be the macarons from the matcha to passion fruit to goma black sesame each delectable bite is the perfect consistency a delicate crunch of the shell the chew of the cookie the buttery cream its served chilled but not cold enough to shock you the cold actually enhances the subtle flavors the macaron even when i bought it at the end of the day was not soggy or hard or unpleasant also the size may look small but its pretty thick and fluffy it might have been the best macaron ive ever had i normally would reserve a star just because i havent tried everything but the service is really superb i arrived five minutes after takahachi had closed for the evening the manager or owner saw me looking plaintively in through the glass door and happily opened back up for me and jon f to run inside for goodies we were served with smiles even after a long day at work and received a free pastry to booti love this place
when my friend from canada was from here she surprised me by saying that tariffs for us running shoes are so high in her homeland that she was stoked to stock up while in nyccity sales tax be damned she met up with another friend and came back with two pairs of sneakers raving about this place called paragonsince im not a runner i forgot about this information until i started needing a new swim cap i almost went on an online ordering binge then realized that i wanted one right away and that i wanted to see it before buying it when i searched for city stores selling a passable range of swimming equipment i came up with modells and paragon sports modells of course was sort of a bust just a boring streamlined selection and i wanted more optionsso my first visit to paragon was after work when i stepped into this multistory wonderland of sporting goods and apparel it was like falling down a rabbit hole to a different state where people can actually be outdoorsi made a beeline for the swim counter on the second floor but noticed a ton of other stuff on the way organic ladies apparel on sale yoga clothes underarmour camping gear tennis rackets and on and onthe man at the swim counter was beleaguered by an overbearing man and his bratty daughter who were asking about goggles luckily for me there were sample caps spread out artfully over the counter and i fondled and stretched them until i had a few candidates when the pesky customers left i asked the man for his opinion and he helped me confirm the choice of a newly designed white silicone cap from speedo very happy with iti wasnt sure at first where to check out so i walked a couple steps to the watch and accessories counter where another attentive salesperson directed me around the corner to an easy checkout bypassing the ground floor clusterfuckthe second time i stopped at paragon was when a dear friend meaning well bought me about ten gel packets a pair of goggles and a fanny pack type contraption prior to my swim at the end of september as i didnt end up using any of these things i brought the merchandise back without tags and without the receipt and they still let me have store credit after a sensible round of questionswith the store credit i bought a much needed exercise ball though there were only a few alternatives a nice lady tolerated my ceaseless questions about which one was better as if id use the damn thing to bust my flubby gut i also got a ton of nouveau running socks for my psycho marathon running sisterthe nyc markup does apply here but its not as severe as it seems to be in other stores also there were tons of rotating sales around and that was great to seewhen there was slight confusion at the register a young curly haired man in a flannel shirt stepped in fixed things smiled nodded and went away a female cashier put her hand over her chest and said to her coworker you know that was the owner right so this is apparently a family owned operation and i was there to witness the hands on benefits of that fact in a city that can often be commercial and impersonal in its industries this will be my go to stop if im stuck in the city and need something general or particular pertaining to sports personal fitness or the great outdoors
had a stressful day at work been on a plane all day and feel like you have been through a meat grinder or maybe just need somewhere to unwind go no further than the iconic bemelmans bar at the carlyle hotel it may be in a hotel but this the upper east side not times square or central park south so this place is not littered with tourists the entrance is an unassuming door off the lobby duck inside and you are transported to another world a world of old school charm and fawning attentive service there is a piano in the middle of the room with a guy playing it and singing standards there are no windows and it is very dimly lit well it is dark in there but that is ok as your eyes will adjust i was seated at a corner table along a wall and sat on a comfy leather seat i ordered a goose and soda and they did it up nice tall narrow glass with ice and the vodka poured in but not the soda which was brought in a separate bottle for me to add so i can make the drink exactly how i like it fantastic my server was always available but did not come by and hover at all during my visiti came in stressed with a lot on my mind and bemelmans bar put my mind at ease and made me feel relaxed and refreshed upon leaving i was ready to head one more time into the breach head held high

the most delicious bagels in hoboken perhaps my favorite bagels in the world in fact on the rumored doomsday i plan to start my day off with a sesame bagel with cream cheese from this the most glorious bagel establishment at least ill know ive had one of lifes little treasures on my last daythe place is a hole in the wall recently improved with some snazzy new brighter lighting yup you heard me you can see in here now perhaps someday there will be a regular crazy light show up in here at least a girl can dream the tiny establishment always fills up quickly with a line almost out the door word to the wise about this line get in it wait eventually you will be first and someone will take your order after youve given your order step to the left and wait patiently for the same person who took your order to give you your ordered goodness and accept your payment its always a bumblejumble up at the front of the line especially when you get firsttime orderers at the front of the line oh and a personal request to the stroller mafia in hoboken please leave your stroller outside there is no room for your stroller inside no room at allall of the bagels are fresh in fact they are so fresh that sometimes when you request a toast not champagne ok they tell you umm mam those bagels just came out of the oven and are hot do you really your bagel toasted the cream cheeses are also delicious and can be ordered in a tub or on your bagel the schmears on the bagels are enough for at least two bagels yummyi cant say enough about quality of the bagels i got a block and a half out of my way to avoid the subpar bagel joint closer to my house oh and in the warm weather there are tables outside so you can actually sit and enjoy your bagelbtw they close at
i fall into an awkward category sometimes i call it the prematurely middleagedsee im and ive been in the same relationship since the dawn of time im and ive actually said the words want to just stay in and play scrabble tonight im and i honestly cant remember the last time i did a shotsay it with me now everybody yikesso my fianc√© and i dont fit in super well at bars that target our specific age group we stand there uncomfortably eavesdropping as our peers youthfully flit and flirt around the bar like tiny energetic birds happily chatting it up with other young singles eventually we retreat to a table for two order something responsible like a light beer and talk about things like this american life and frequent flier miles at hookup bars this kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable at the drink we fit right inits not too loud the lighting is nice they serve yummy punch its usually filled with groups of friends and couples the ceiling is covered with maps i feel almost like a normal person its great if youre looking for a place to act ten years older than your age you may have just found it and i do mean that in a good way
seafood galore and a lovely place to have an intimate birthday dinneron a cold and rainy wednesday night the place was packed to the gills pun intended while waiting to be seated we were rubbing shoulders with a lovely fatherdaughter hopefully duo in the crowd they gushed about the food and recommended the cod once we were seated the insanely knowledgeable waitress who knew about everything on the menu and can give you a spoton mouthwatering description on command rattled off the poetic specials of the day we asked for recommendations for wine and she suggested one that was dry mineraly and just a hint of grapes though her words were better than mine of the dishes we ordered there were many winners the fluke roll one of the special appetizers of the evening was quite possibly the best cousinosushi i have had in new york thin pieces of fluke wrapped around avacado and rice floating in a lovely soybased sauce my entree was simply ahmazing i listened to the gentelman and ordered the truffle crusted cod with mushroom ravioli on a bed of spinach and truffle sauce yes truffles are in there twice i had dreams of bathing in this sauce using the snorkel as a straw rather than a breathing apparatus the cod was so flaky and wonderful that all other cod that have come before and will come after will fall short in some waywriting this review has made me long to go back and pull up a seat at the bar and order oyster after oyster from the seemingly endless list cant wait until my birthday next year

if you know me then you know i love speakeasies if you try and tell me that its a fad its overdone its a stupid concept i freak out i literally have a breakdown and start telling you how wrong you are i would rather be in a speakeasy than any other type of bar in this great cityso its really no surprise that when my friend lea b said i had to try this secret bar that just opened up in chelsea i obviously cancelled everything on my calendar and went immediately you are probably now thinking that i am some sort of lush that my life revolves around perfect cocktails and hidden joints not so i just appreciate the secrecy of the space and if a master mixologist makes me a drink i am not going to turn it down so last night as i was standing outside the coffee shop that is the front for this bar i got all giddy with excitement what would i find inside would it be big small dimly lit music bathtubs for tables after locating the notsosecret door i entered and it was pretty typical speakeasy style set up my heart still fluttered slightly and we were instantly greeted by the owner david who sat us at a cozy table for three we perused the menu that boasted many gin drinks but also whiskey tequila and bourbon concoctions which made me happy since gin and i dont really get along so well and there was a food menu nothing crazy but pretty substantial for a secret spot like this good thing we were starving and couldnt wait to get our hands on some grub we immediately ordered the lamb chops which came coated in homemade tzatziki sauce and i dont know about you but one of my great loves in life are both lamb and tzatziki and when put together my head explodes from happiness these miniature lamb chops slid right off the bone and were perfectly cooked the sauce was clearly fresh and made that day since i dont do one of anything and always dine big we also ordered the mushroom gnocchi which was delicious and a small portion which is good since i have absolutely zero self control and would have eaten an entire full sized portion and then felt sick afterwards smart little bar we also tried out their herb fries with black truffle aioli and i really couldnt get enough of that that aioli was incredible we wound up ordering another serving i know i know one should never pig out while sipping their cocktail but i literally couldnt help myself luckily my friends are foodie fiends too and chowed down just as hard oh are you wondering about my drink are you thinking im an animal thats okay with me i ordered some sort of bourbongingercinnamongoodness in a class with a wedge of orange and some oversized ice cubs i told the waitress i wanted bourbon and wintery flavors and the bartender mixed me up something fierce do you want to hear about the decor no well i dont much care im going to tell you anyway gorgeous upholstered walls with a baroque pattern vintage chandeliers and chairs and couches nooks and crannies everywhere for hiding outor making out everything was dark green and sexyjust the way i like it the bathrooms were even fun with oversized copper tublike sinks the music playing was right out of the boardwalk empire as i am sitting there totally full and happy as a clam i notice there is a gigantic copper vintage bathtub just chilling out in the middle of the floor when the owner walked by again i asked him if he would potentially allow us to get in there and take photos his response i would highly encourage it to state the obvious i will be back next time with an empty stomach again and quite a few more people bar hidden in a coffee shop win
chinese film auteur wong karwais first englishlanguage movie my blueberry nights received generally poor notices most reviewers used to expecting transcendence from his films frowned at the stilted dialogue and thin plot then went right back to loving his chinese work but one critic brought up an intriguing unsettling point if you really sat down with them didnt all his movies have those very same flaws was it just the buffer of them being in a foreign language that had allowed so many cinephiles to blindly worship at the temple of karwaia complicated issue and one that flitted through my mind as the first of seven courses at kajitsu was placed in front of my convive and me our server introduced the terrine of autumn vegetables by stating that chef nishihara meant the rectangular prism to evoke the foliage of japan at this time of year the server pointed out that one end the south was still pleasantly green as represented on the plate by okra and broccoli and the other end the north was flush with the crimsons and golds of the leaves turning color as simulated by carrots beets et alin virtually any other restaurant id have rolled my eyes at what i mightve taken to be heavyhanded symbolism but through a myriad of tiny details of decor and of service kajitsu creates such an enveloping atmosphere of having entered another universe that i was willing to go with it this was when wong karwai flashed through my brain was i merely being deceived by the hype the two michelin stars my japanophilia was i forgiving kajitsu its foibles because it cloaked them in otherworldlinessthen i took the dish on its own terms i traced from south to north incising the clear agar in which the strata of vegetation had been set i moved through the gentle gradations of flavor of crispness and startling lucidity and found myself wholly transported into nishiharas world after alllets be clear that world is not japan proper i doubt the literalness of that first course wouldve flown in the subtle food culture there and when i was blown away by shojin ryori at a temple in kyoto itself i never never thought it could be transplanted here it cant but what nishihara achieves is something arguably even finer than slavish authenticity to a native template he fits japanese shojinryori buddhist temple cuisine into a nyc idiom by weaving in nylocal seasonal ingredients and eversoslightly nontraditional techniques he acts like a translator of poetry leaving traces of his own voice on the original gorgeous frameworkmaitake mushrooms native to japan but also to the eastern us played a role in multiple dishes taking center stage in a light tempura crust as it perched on a wheel of tender eggplant above a deeply earthy red miso soup it was more supporting but no less striking in croquette form next to fried namafu and sensitively grilled vegetables my convives eyes snapped open at the burst of flavor that two tiny tomatoes on the plate brought a simple bowl of steamed kabocha mustard greens and taro root made no bid for attention but earned it all the same homemade udon with a sesame dipping sauce flecked with shiso and shichimi exquisite so was the hijikilaced rice bowl that provided a traditional end to the meal along with tsukemono that spanned the gamut from subtly vinegared cucumber to resonantly piquant kelpi circle back to wong karwai even if you clash with the filmmakers aesthetic you cannot credibly argue with the force of his thematic convictions so it is at kajitsu chef nishiharas physical hand is behind each dish true but it is his metaphorical hand guiding each meal through its exhilarating yet smooth abstract narrative that really carries the day if anyone needed proof that peacefulness does not preclude passion that reaching for formal perfection does not prevent individuality from shining through all the more brightly or for that matter that vegan cuisine can excite beyond belief then kajitsu will serve as all the anecdotal evidence one needs bewitched and blinded by oriental otherness you accuse fine stick to lupa raouls gramercy tavern youll have a good meal when youre ready for it kajitsu will welcome you it has converted skeptics before and if youre lucky it will convert you probability of return within year this is a place where a visit should not be taken lightly

thanks for the great find yelpers anytime my mom comes to visit me we always get taiwanese food up until recently we were just barely satisfied with the restaurants we frequented in the bay area we had to lower our standards a bit and settle for mediocre foodwe were not expecting much when we walked into this hole in the wall so we were more than pleasantly surprised at the generous portions and delicious foodthey offer the gamut of typical taiwanese fare and the two of us went to town we ordered oyster pancake owazen fried rice vermicelli mi fen clam soup dry sauteed green beans red chili oil wontons and stewed fatty ground pork over rice ask for more sauce less oil more meat everything was top notch oysters were plentiful i think total and the somewhat chewy eggy glutinous texture of the egg and rice flour pancake smothered in sweet sauce was spot on the clam soup was perfect generous amount of clams in a light clear broth sprinkle some white pepper and enjoy i loved the red chili oil wontons totaldelicious little pork dumplings nestled under bright red chili oil and topped with enough garlic to make gargling with listerine times a necessity yum all dishes were inc taxthe food was probably the one of the best ive had outside of taiwan my mom was so delighted with our meal she wanted to go back days later to take my dad and boyfriend just so we could order more things the of us made the hour trek out to flushing again and ordered dishes intestine with pork blood in brown sauce fatty ground pork over rice rice noodle vermicelli fried fish fillet with spicy bean sauce fresh stir fried veggies stir fried jalapenos and beef beef noodle soup oyster pancake clam soup and red chili oil wontons all worth it we were stuffed and had a ton of leftovers all of which tasted just as good the day afterfresh good quality great quantity and extremely reasonable fast and friendly service im a huge fan

if i could quantify the sensation of a creme brulee doughnut it would be rated infinity plus oneanother one of those rare nyc places that delivers beyond its absurdly lofty expectations i cant believe im saying this but the hype is well deserved and probably should be greater
this burger nearly killed me everything about it was perfect as was my drink i was filled to the brim after half of the meaty mess but forced myself to continue shoving it in my mouth after finishing i felt like i had been hit by a truck and immediately excused myself for a cigarette it took me at least two hours to recoverbut it was worth it
so is this what ive been waiting for all these yearsthose were my thoughts as i opened the door it was am and there were people ahead of me in the line waiting patiently there was no bouncer at the door to remind one of the tacky experience of buying cupcakes of quality that would make one weep more than by watching steel magnolias it did make me smile after more than four and a half years of reviewing macarons including years of clarifying to people the difference between macarons and coconut macaroons and flying in macarons from across the country and across the atlantic all the while watching multiple generations of magnolia clones bankers turned bakers and corner delis sporting large cardboard signs screaming cupcakes next to those for phone cards mint money from freudian psychology finally the day had come that there were more customers waiting in line at a shop selling macarons than at the flagship locations of magnolia crumbs mollys and baked by melissa combined yes i went around to compare it generated more adrenalin than a victory lapi must also confess upfront that i am slightly biased against laduree and am in the pierre herme camp this is mainly a result of my conviction that laduree lags pierre herme and others in most pastries and even croissants i mean seriously have you had the ispahan croissant now that takes baking to the level of an art that should not detract from the fact that laduree makes outstanding macarons arguably the best however i find it simplistic to say best for any top tier patisserie in paris makes excellent macarons and on any given day sadaharu aoki dalloyau even jean paul hevin and others not just pierre herme can compete with laduree for top honors while there may be production variability by day there is also overall consistency by flavordesign and so i would similarly be hard pressed to find anyone other than laduree making my favorite versions of cassis or orange blossom fleur de oranger there can be no doubt on the quality of the macarons in the nyc shop for they are flown in and the only question is as to how theyve handled the transatlantic travel while i dont understand the assertion that they are flown in fresh daily they dont need to cant be fresh off the oven nor do economics justify anything more frequent than a weekly flight as is the case with lmdc i have limited issues with the nyc ones aesthetically or texturally though i did find the jam ones raspberry strawberry somewhat of a softer texture than the others also a complaint in prior reviews but they held up fairly well to the bite test obviously once local baking in nyc commences it would be time for a review update but for now i am thrilled that laduree has arrived at for a small macaron these may be pricier than what youd find at say a little oven but for the price point i find them infinitely superior to the b of fp at hoservice is courteous and efficient i was greeted at pm by a server who wanted to know the details of my purchase i paid and left at pm and the minute doortodoor has been the average wait time earlier as well my heart did go out to the distinguished graceful elderly lady who left after waiting minutes while politely wishing us well i tried to while away the time first by reading and then by engaging the attractive girl behind me in a conversation but upon finding out that she didnt like macarons and was only there to help out colleagues the conversation just died i mean what could i possibly have in common with someone who doesnt like macarons really jkwith another laduree outlet expected to open in soho in spring the only real question left is what are you waiting for monsieur herme

popped in for a quick lunch with my sister on a blustery day and was warmly greeted by the very charming and cute italian waiters small and quaint on the lower level where we were seated for lunch sadly it was too chilly for the outsidewe were served a warm fresh loaf of bread with dipping oil and herbs while we waited for our meals i looked longingly at some of the appetizers they had like the spinach souffle and carpaccio and made a mental note to come back herei ordered one of the specials which was the linguini with clams and was surprised with the abundant amount of clams on my dish there had to be about or of those little suckers which would be generous even by dinner portion standards no puny little wannabe clams either im talking meaty ive been taking steroids kinda clams my sister whom is a finicky eater requested her own special dish of angelhair crushed tomatoes and fresh basil which they were nice to oblige and she had only rave remarks about how the perfectly they had made it up with just the right amount of fresh garlic excellent quality of fresh grated parmesan clearly not a foodvendor supply but rather a quite fresh onepepolino i will be back probably several times your menu is just too damn good
so much fun came here last night saturday to celebrate a friends birthday and the music was awesome they were playing fun top but also old school rap music little bits of everything also there was no coverwe arrived around ish and had to wait outside for a bit which was a huge bummer in the freezing cold plus having gone to barsclubs in la and vegas ive never had to wait in line before but i still havent quite figured out how nyc places work the line really wasnt too bad though we were in within minutesthe place was mildly packed at and i guess i understand why the bouncers forced ppl to wait outside because it made the place more spacious and there was actually room to reach the bar get my dance moves onwe danced alllll night long and while there are a bunch of other things for nondancers to do like pool tables foozball jenga make outdry hump each other by the giant horse in the back corner my friends and i were too busy shakin our stufftheres also free coatcheck i will definitely be back here and bring friends visiting to this place its not super upscale and fancy even though its definitely nice and there were people who dressed up you can chat with friends onthe lounge chairs or dance i love how laid back this place was but not grotty and dingy also it seems like a lot of people came with friends so there werent as many sleaze bags trying to hit on everyone plusim gonna try to check out the other nights ive found one of my new dance spots in nyc its a keeper
just a hop skip and a jump from zabars the other staple that holds down the uws barney gs has the best breakfast food this side of the hudson a year old institution barney greengrass is the place grandfathers take their grandkids for meals on weekends to introduce them to all manner of smoky fish and salty meats to devour rugelach and chocolate babka and to learn how to pronounce it all correctly the front is mostly for takeout purchases although has a few tables for overflow the back room preserved in time for grandchildren to admire is the restaurant proper covered in horseandwagon wallpaper which is somehow charming even though its green the space isnt large and the tables are pretty close so be prepared for long waits on weekends and to inadvertently overhear all conversations at neighboring tables no matter when you show upthe dishes arent cheap but they are worth it my recommendation is to go with barneys specialties the eggs with nova and onions which comes with a bagel cream cheese cannot be beat and you cant find a better pastrami and eggs anywhere in nyc if none of the specialties appeal to you hit the sandwiches but be prepared to be unable to finish them and you cannot leave without having a black and white cookie i know theyre available all over the city but this cookie is so fluffy and moist its more like a cake ive just made myself so hungry im gonna head there now see ya
a great discovery for all the seasons of the yeari found this park through friends about years ago in the dead of winter during a snow stormill call it a snow day so much snow that work was closed and we decided to put on our snowboarding gear and find some sleds to slide down the hills in this park withwe brought shovels and made ourselves some speed bumps the local kids were going crazy with it and went flying off on their sledscome spring the guy and i decide to explore the park some more by going for a run around the park its avenue block wide and about streets in length that may not sound very large at all but in this neighborhood its a good amount of space and its beautifully laid out thank you nyc parks deptyou can chose to run on the bordering sidewalks on the paved trail which includes a few small hills or go on the track mile loop during the summer some friends played tennis here we also came quite a few times to lay out in the sun you can sunbathe here and no one will bother you its really convenient because theres no sand and no traffic to put up within the fall i come to run and watch the local hs football play in the middle of the trackthey also hold special events and charities here ive seen a senior citizen movie night in the basketball court south end and ive attended their annual juniper valley american cancer society relay for life around the tracks north endsome other great activities you can do herehockey rink tennisbasketballhandball courtbaseball fieldsoftball fielddog walkrunsoccerfootball fieldbatting playgroundssunbathebike ridinggarden section for sitting relaxingafter last years tornado it was really upsetting to see uprooted trees all around the park they were laid out on the sidwalks for a month or two i really hope the nyc dept of parks replaces the trees i really love this park and id love to see some more great community events here

yemeni restaurants in manhattan in bk winner brooklyn this month i learned that food from yemen underrated my hearts won over by the mind numbing feast of lamb okrapotato stew fresh baked flatbread the length of a medium pizza with that said yemen cuisine in the vein of other creatively named restaurants like american chinese restaurant or lees buffet is not a looker by any means a peep through the exterior windows may cause your stomach to involuntarily constrict and your appetite to vanish the a grade certificate taped at the entrance suddenly seems suspect the green neon lighting does not help unless the aspiration is to replicate an otb hall or the dmv to give you a sense of how they operate try asking the following do you take credit cards may we have utensils check please answers the equivalent of using your amex at a food truck they will oblige but note the bread is multifunctional waiters response silence and two blinks your total is xx he says and leaves this is clearly an eco operation but no matter this is about the food the glorious food a starter of soothing gently seasoned lamb broth served with a wedge of lemon stacks of warm freshly baked flat bread replenished without request im not exaggerating about the size you can ride it like a sled though why would you want to its delicious a full stack of tender roast lamb meat lovers rejoice the name escapes me but its like a pureed salsa terrifically fresh and flavorful this provided a great contrast to the heavy protein a viscous gravy like stew with okra chunks of potato eggplant so addictive i wept like baby a selfserve station for the post meal tea it was stewed in clove and cardamom and can be found near the broom closet restroomwhich id avoid at all costs our meal here felt like dining in a time warp there arent many places like these anymore and you wonder how much longer theyll be here when you note the neighboring bank and drug store chains and the shiny trader joes down the block do yourself a favor and pay them a visittip nicely if youre able
its about time that the far upper east side where east harlem meets starts getting spots like this that you would normally find only downtown earls beer cheese is located in a pretty vacant stretch along park ave and where the train overpass meets the tunnel underground not much of a view but who cares when all you need to look at are your terrific beers and wonderful cheese platesas others here have mentioned the place is insanely tiny personally that does not bother me as long as i can grab a seat or spot to enjoy my brew for others i can see where they would become claustrophobic quickly when we arrived here around on saturday there were only around eight people there but by i had counted around and it was jammed packed this place has become popular very quickly in this neck of the woods and for good reasonbasically it is one long communal table that seats people a small counter with a few stools looks out the front and there is another narrow counter along the wall to stand at really before we left a few hours later there still must have been close to people in there and it was rocking they were playing a cool mix of rock and i remember hearing the cars and the police playing a lot also it can get a bit warm in here but they had the whole front open letting in a nice evening breeze the place resembles a faux hunting lodge with mounted deer heads on the walls murals of deer in the woods and a bathroom that looks like you are in a wooden shed the menu features some creative takes on cheese we had the beer cheese which was terrific comes in basket of bread that is presented as toast points buttered on each side so airy and crispy you get a good amount of spreadable cheddar beer cheese and a tin with garlic cloves too yummy yum yummmmmmbeer cheese just thinking about it is making me droolthere are other plates such as a cheese board grilled cheese sandwiches asian gnocchi beef mac cheese a gourmet eggo waffle with foie gras cheddar and coffeecured bacon among a few other items to choose from from what we tried and talking to the people around us eating everything here is onpoint just order at the bar and the staff will bring it over to you accepts credit cards too and everything here is pretty cheap overall can i mention the beer selection i was pleasantly surprised at the craft beer options on tap and in cans draft beers served in glass mugs go for and canned beers run they even have growlers to go refills for a growler the four line beer selection rotates and they bring in different brews constantly autumnation in cans victory pilsner on tap and troegs stout on tap were just a few that we enjoyed they pair exceptionally well with the cheese plate selections herepersonally i love a small place like this that serves the local community saw a mix of younger newbies and older stalwarts of the area in here there was even a group of older ladies visiting from poland that came in to down a few pints next to us and then head out it was too funny again this small place is probably not for everyone especially if you cant deal with crowds and being squished next to other patrons i guess it also depends on what time you go as i heard that right after work hours early evening is very busy still this has become a new favorite of mine in my hood so glad it is not downtown or in brooklyn as it is only a few minutes walk from where i live easy access for me to go and try out some more wonderful cheese concoctions and thirst quenching tasty beers
id been waiting to try this place out for literally over a year the first time i went i go to arthur ave every once in awhile but i kept putting off coming here its owned by roberto paciullo the man behind robertos and arguably the best italian restauranteur in new york hes opening another location in manhattan eventually but i believe in always trying the original finally i got to try and it definitely lived up to the billingfirst thing you notice here is the amount of work they did to make this place look like its smack dab in the middle of some campanian village from the texture on the walls to the skylight to the oven if this place doesnt transport you to italy nothing will the service is very professional and as hard as i am on servers i found absolutely no fault with them thats a festivus miracle in itself and smack dab in the middle of the restaurant was the most important thing roberto paciullo he wasnt barking out orders or anything just sitting and having lunch with a friend his presence alone was enough to ensure that everyone was on their game thats great leadership and exactly what it takes to make a great restaurant one of the best in the citysince the first time was only lunch i just got pizza although the rest of the menu made me think twice the bread they brought out as well was a great variety and looked to be from madonia but couldve been from a few different places as there were several kinds the pizza i got was the riccardo which had buttersquash puree along with smoked mozzarella spicy pancetta and basil the crust couldve used more char but was pillowy soft and had a nicely risen lip all around i was actually expecting something more crisp and with less of a lip as this is salernostyle pizza but this worked just fined while the crust was great it was outshined by everything else simply put this combo worked the pancetta was the fatty kind they serve in italy broken into bits and with a subtle little bit of heat as promised this contrasted with the smoked mozzarella from casa della mozzarella around the block which was bursting with milky smokiness combined with the sweetness of the squash every bite was bursting with flavor the only change i would make would be to add a bit more basil as it acted as a wonderful balancing agent that brought all the different flavors together all in all one of the best pizzas ive had and thats saying something at this point the next time i came back for the normal menu with a group of for starters we had the zuppa di vongole and the calamari alla peperonata both were pefectly executed with the sweet tiny clams being the standout for me the calamari was also perfectly cooked with the flavor of the peppers standing out in particular we decided to get a bottle of wine and our server was extremely helpful in selecting one that worked with all of our dishes a reasonably priced super tuscan for my main i got the linguini al nero di seppia e calamari which is their homemade linguini in a black squid ink sauce with calamari and cuttlefish thrown in the mix it was awesome the flavor of the tomatoes wasnt lost and the squid ink wasnt overpoweringtwo common issues with this dish the homemade linguini was a perfect al dente as well once again the calamari here was perfectly cooked and the cuttlefishwhich feels halfway between octopi and calamariwas too this was food exactly as it is in the south of italy fresh simple and straight forward also when we were leaving one of my friends left something behind and the waiter ran out after us to make sure the schmuck didnt forget it from the appetizers to the service to the espresso we had at the end this place was remarkably consistent in how great it wasat this point if youre interested in italian food youve probably heard of arthur ave already if you havent gone already youre probably looking for an excuse the restaurants around here can be a mixed bag but youd be hard pressed to go wrong with this place one weekend go to the bronx zoo for a few hours use the southern blvd exit walk north a bit and turn onto and walk over to the neighborhood retail market bread bakery meat market cheese shop pasta shop eat some clams on the side walk at a seafood market and this place if that isnt a good day then what the hell is

blossom is one of those places you curse yourself for not having visited sooner and promise yourself to come back as frequently as your teensy paychecks allowarmed with my yelp deal for a minute massage and facial i stumbled my way to blossom after a particularly brutal spin class i was feeling a wee bit woozy and my body was wrecked after three weeks of keeping my ass in line at the gym i was struck by how cute and clean and efficient everything was inside it was busy but all the staff was bustling about and no one seemed to wait long sally took me back to my small dark candlelit room smelling of delicious aromatherapy and instructed me to take everything off but my underwear i giggled and told her i wasnt wearing any and not fazed in the slightest she told me to just get comfy under the towel sally is amazing if i wasnt too busy drooling through the facehole in the table i would have dropped right down on one knee and proposed to her and her miracle working hands she asked how i liked my massages and i told her pretty hard but she laughed and said shed start medium because sometimes people cried when she went fullforce my advice is this trust the woman she has a lot of power packed into that tiny body and she worked into every knot in my back and tushie i love when they massage my tushie over and over again we moved onto the facial and it was equally fab everything smelled delightful and her hands went seamlessly from insanely gentle around my eyes to the perfect pressure on my head and temples she started with a cleanser then steamed my face for a good couple of minutes and thencame the extractions i felt like my face was being sliced open but i cant fault her for that because i always want to cry like a bitch during this part of facials so much so that today while involuntary tears fell down the sides of my face i wondered how i would ever endure the pain of childbirth ah well thats a discussion for another day she finished with exfoliation and a hydrating mask it felt so good that i dozed off you guys my skin looked immediately better luminous and clean and tight tight tight all this despite the fact that those extractions left me sure that my face was bleeding and mangledi highly recommend sally and blossom i cant wait to come back
i am not into following movie stars television personalities circus clowns whatever what i look for in a nyc restaurant and what i truly appreciate is a talented chefthen if the restaurant decor is pleasing to me i enjoy it even more i plan future events in my head based on my experience i also vault my future plans on location in the city im rarely on the lower east side so going to is a stretch for me marea smack dab in the middle of my worldi could care less if gerard butler loves this place he probably sold his soul to the devil to get where hes at in this stage of his careertalk to me about fusilli with grilled octopus and bone marrow mmmthe crowd here is a little stuffy for me if i can get the guys from raos to come here id make this joint my own have my own table with a sign on it billy saltsi ordered a beer at the bar an italian microbrew genziana a patron drinking a white wine with ice in his glass wtf asked me what i was drinking maybe after a few glasses of wine we can take over this placemy fusilli with grilled octopus and bone marrow was outstanding worth every nickel the bread that was offered was a little strange some dude comes around with a tray wanna a piece yeah stupid i do no olive oil dipping sauce only a cold slab of butter i should take a star off for that move but i love me some fusilli with grilled octopus and bone marrow so im in im out im billy salts the ginger bread manfind this place if your uptown for some great italian food let the stars schmooze with each other pass me the pasta
sandwiches here come in extra kardashiani had skimmed the previous reviews and noted several mentions of the roast beef so thats what i ordered what i received was a foot long inch wide vessel of sliced beef molten cheese grilled onions smothered with what looked to be the skimmed refuse from the deepwater horizonit was a big gooey dripping mass of mess and already oozing everywhere before getting it to the table but once i folded it shut and took a bite i was in sandwich nirvana usually with a sandwich this size id save half for lunch the next day but given the glorious goop nature of this beast i ate most of it in one sitting which i thought was quite an accomplishment then some skinny dude sits down at the next table with a sandwich that was about long seriously warning do not order here if you are wearing nice clothes are on a first date or generally eat finger foods with a knife and fork there will be blood only not real blood but their crazy gravy which redefines previous notions of viscosityalso of note the great brooklyn staff cussing up a storm about football the walls adorned with autographed photos of italian actorssportsman plus scenes of old brooklyn and older italy sadly youll probably not get to experience the crazy customer who entertained me an italian american my cousin vinny type who was arguing with her soontobeex over the phone and describing where she was going to shove her new license plates this is a deli that looks like any deli you might walk by in greater ny but it would be sad if you walked by and didnt try it in fact its worth a special trip
im pretty sure the ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodles have crack in them they are absolutely perfect the house made egg noodles are just the right texture the crab is sweet the pork is rich and fatty and the sauce that you toss everything in is just complex enough to be interesting but familiar enough to be comforting and everything is in perfect balance theres just the right amount of sauce and crab and pork and veggies for the noodles it is a model dry noodle dish never greasy or heavyget yourself some snacks too to whet your appetite theres these tasty spareribs fyi if youre gonna share snacks you have to get two because one order at lunchtime is literally one rib which is a little intimate spicy tender calamari crisp and refreshing papaya salad theres a spicy beef salad that really is spicy but you will order a jug of the very well made thai iced tea to wash it downall of the other noodle dishes are also very very well done excellent textures excellent saucesbroths im a noodle gal so ive never tried a rice dish but they look bangin service is always friendly and quick and the decor is cozy and relaxed plus they have mini bottles of fish sauce on the table

dear essabageli have a confession to make when i first met you i didnt really like you i had been with so many great bagel places before and you came off as really flaky one day i got a warm bagel one day i got a cold bagelone time i even asked you specifically if your everything bagels were hot you told me yes and then the one i got was cold and hard as a rock i didnt think you cared about me and that hurt my feelingswell i dont know what happened but the last few months have really been magical after such a rocky start youve been so generous to me ever since every time i arrive a smoking hot everything bagel waiting there just for me so perfectly dense such a crunchy outside just chewy enough to make you put in a little bit of effort to eat it but not so much so that it hurts your jaw the ultimate subtle sweetness that i have been searching for in a bagel all my life my faith hath been restoredand i thought it was important to let you know that even through the worst of times your spreads always kept me happy nobody anywhere ever has come even close to your lox spread and its generous chunks of salmon and your whitefish salad and baked salmon salad may be the best shmears ive ever encountered just salty enough just smoky enough and superfresh and even though im not really into all of those veggie and fruit cream cheeses that you seem to be so excited about i might even be willing to give those a try for you if you keep being so good to meand finally im proud to keep standing by you in your battle against toasted bagels i too understand that toasting a highquality bagel is akin to having a highquality steak cooked well done sure its still an efficient vessel for steak sauce but its lost what made it special in the first place keep on fighting the good fightsothere it is essabagel even though i didnt think id ever feel this way at first you have now become the only place that i want to go for my bagels wellexcept for hot bagels on saddle river road in fair lawn nj but you can never really forget your first true love i look forward to spending many more sunday mornings with youlovejordan
five stars for pickles seriously yeah seriously theyre that amazing pickled pineapples thats all im saying you have to run down now and get them before the seasons over i made a quick visit to the pickle guys thinking that i would get really good pickles but instead i got blown away by their pickles they have several different kinds varying in sourness quarter half threequarters and full and different kinds spicy sweet including different vegetables different kinds of tomatoes olives carrots onions beans turnips etc and seasonal varietiesthe pickled pineapples fulfilled my unspoken and unknown pickle desires theyre the perfect balance of sweet tart and spicy i kept popping one after another into my mouth until i puckered up theyre so addicting the funny thing was that i was in line with no intention of getting them of as the people in front of me tasted them and said oh theyre really good ill get those too i also had to taste them and then get them and then based on my reactions the people behind me also tasted and got them and so forth it was a domino chain reaction theyll let you taste whichever pickles you want to taste and theyre really patient with you even if you behave like a silly little thing and change your mind a couple times the guy helping me just smiled and patiently said just tell me what you want sweetheart youre allowed to mix and match your pickles into a quartsize container you can also buy a single pickle and you wont do that after a taste you can also order onlinepicklelicious
the food is incredible and the portions are very large every negative review was written because the writer did something really stupid to get thrown out good i hope they never try to come back because that means i have a better chance of grabbing a tablewe started with the orange julius and mocha nutella shake they were both just as great as you would hopethen came the entrees blisters on my sisters their version of huevos rancheros and mojemima poached eggs and bacon stuffed inside mac n cheese pancakes they were both total flavor explosions in our mouths absolutely phenomenal and totally worth the hype im not a huge fan of huevos rancheros but the blisters was beyond anything ive ever tasted at other restaurants and the mojemima is exactly as good as it soundsthis is my new favorite restaurant
is there a more approachable warm and amiable chef than aaaron sanchez i really cant think of any despite his fame being a judge on multiple food network shows such as chopped which he also competed in during the allstars tournament he should have won btw and chef vs city this secondgeneration latino chef serves his heart on a plate ive seen him since his days on melting pot and have always admired his passion intensity and overall humility i decided i had to finally eat at one of his restaurants to really see if his talents matched his likeability those who are wondering the answer is a resounding yescentrico has a great corner location and the instant feel of the restaurant is lively and open there is outdoor seating which is perfect for warm weather the bar scene is energetic and the main dining area is spacious yet still intimate if youre lucky like we were chef sanchez will be at the pass working his little fiery fingers expediting food to his guests i could not resist the urge to tell him how much i loved him as we walked towards our table he was so gracious about it and i knew at that moment that this was a great man now onto the scrumptious foodappetizersguacamole chips the chunks of avocado were enormous in the wooden mortar and pestle container and the tortilla chips were crunchy and fresh short rib croquetas braised short rib and smoky white beans made for a very delicious starter the meat was so tender and maintained a lot of flavor and juices within the perfectly fried outer shellmainspollo con mole pan roasted chicken mole sanchez wild mushrooms this was the one entree that specifically had his name on it which sealed my decision to go for it the chicken was unbelievably moist and really took in the flavor of the sauce not sure what variety of mole was used but it was wellbodied and had a mild creamy texture the wild mushrooms were amazing i had to share this dish bc the portion was outofthisworld pescado a la veracruzano market fish tomato olive serrano the boyfriends choice which i actually ended up really enjoying possibly more than the chicken dish the fish was cooked to perfection it was soft and flaky and the lightness of the fresh fish was wellbalanced against the acidity and heat from the tomato and serrano peppers the added saltiness of the olives were fantastic i could have eaten two servings of this dish dessertnone we did a little naughty and actually had ice cream before going to dinner we were early for our rezzie and decided to make a pit stop at my favorite ice cream shop lulas apthoecary for a birthday cone for the boyfriend when the waiter had asked us if we wanted to take a look at the dessert menu we had to regretfully decline this story leads into the highlight of our dining experience at centrico as we waited for our check which i felt was taking too long lo and behold chef sanchez comes out with a delicious chococlate cake candlelit i might add all for jimmys birthday i had mentioned in passing that it was his special day when he came by to say hi and enabled my inner dork the chance for a photoop with him i was so grateful and thrilled just to hear him wish jimmy a happy birthday i had no idea he would show that level of kindness and personally bring him a gift the dessert was on the house but i was floored by his graciousness and people around us were feeling the love too i had to show them my gratitude and tipped well over the going rate of and to be honest service was in fact great in the end it was a very successful meal hitting all the right marks i felt transported and didnt mind that i had eated mexican at least during the week leading up to centrico it felt like a new experience altogeher i thought to myself as we left the restaurant that not only is aaron sanchez a celebrity chef but a very talented one at that and he is also a genuine person mexican cuisine has been blessed with such a worthy and reputable ambassador in aaron sanchez and his love and work ethic is embodied in centrico and his ongoing endeavors much love and success i will never forget this night viva

i love how good food can put a great big smile on your face and lomzynianka not sure how you would even pronounce that is a place that will do just thati never knew that greenpoint had such a large polish community but its here and very present polish writing on stores delis bakeries and restaurants says it all when you walk in lomzynianka is dimly lit with pink and white flowered table clothes what youd expect in eastern europe and reminiscent of my grandmas homeeven the aroma of the place gets you hungry the place seems to be family owned and run the owner is the waiter and two older women work in the little kitchen cooking when you first sit they bring you out a platter with various cole slaws cabbage and carrot variations very goodwhats even greater about this place is the prices so cheap for such good quality food to begin my friend and i each ordered the borscht she ordered the white borscht soup which has pieces of what appear to be kielbasa or someother type of sausage and red borscht soup with vegetables both were delicious and only each the food tastes like home cooking and to be quite honest the soups themselves are feeling enough to be your mealafter the soups we ordered the polish platter now which comes with pierogies cheese potato and vegetable kielbasa a bbqd sausage stuffed cabbage bigos a sorta vegetable beef stew mass and mashed potatoesexcellentreally the food here was incredible and felt like a very authentic atmosphere i cant wait to go back and of course i definitely recommend lomzynianka
the last dinner i had during a vacation in japan was at a tiny sushi bar deep in tokyos roppongi district handpicked by the family of my cousins japanese wife we were the only customers that night the chef was an artist in continual motion his raw material culled from tsukiji market mere hours before his nigiri poetry itself fireworks exploded behind my eyes the entire time testament to the meals stunning qualityyet still it could not erase sushi yasuda from my mindalmost years of eating memories i have built up many of them in the nyc area countless exceptional moments but no single restaurant meal has had more of an effect on me than the omakase i had from chef yasudasan himself in true before then programmed by my filipino genes i enjoyed eating immensely but after the meal food became the keenest of all my obsessions that is what one perfect hour can doin the seven years since id been back to yasuda but once escorting one very special lady there for lunch in we didnt really talk about it afterwards my only clue to her opinion is that to this day her yelp profile lists sushi yasuda as her designated last meal on earthwhen i heard this past winter that yasudasan had decided to return to japan my breath caught in my throat sushi yasuda would march on under a trusted lieutenant but how could it ever be the same i needed to know i would give the sushiya several months to complete the transition then i would return to pit it against the virtually invincible fortress of my memoriesnow a beautiful summer day textured paper in the windows was new otherwise all was the same as four years prior i sat at the counter the young chef before me tatsuya sekiguchi gave me a plate with pickled ginger on it i popped a slice in my mouth just as a palate cleanserand i realized instantly that i had made a mistakeunderstand everything at yasuda is made from scratch from the grated wasabi to the soy sauce the ginger vanished on my tongue releasing its crisp flavor like a water balloon popping my god even the ginger was breathtakingno wonder id been reluctant to return even my visit had been more of a lark than premeditation the place was a temple to sushi a sanctum sanctorum that should not be breached lightly how had i forgotten i wanted to get up say im sorry i have to wait for a lifechanging experience to come back i dont deserve this right now bow in deepest apologybut tatsusan smiled warmly at me seeming to detect that amongst the businessmen and japanese expats at the counter i was the one who felt most privileged to be there you have been here before he saidnot in yearsi hope you enjoyit felt like an absolution my panic subsided i settled on a simple lunch special carefully crossreferencing my choices for five nigiri pieces and two rolls with the several handmarked chefspicks for fish of the day i can add a piece of kinmedai right i askedtatsusan smiled again this time with his eyes yes yes his youthful looks belied the brisk assurance of his movements it seemed like only seconds passed before he was placing each delicate glistening morsel in front of me fluke orata orange clam i dont remember my exact order it doesnt matter when i put the first piece in my mouth a cadence sounded in my head and the world dissolved awayit was like some positive form of ptsd my food life flashing before my eyes eating baconsilog at the kitchen table in my childhood home treefiltered sunlight angling into the room like a scene from a malick film showing my college sweetheart how to squeeze every last drop of flavor out of a lobster pleasure thrumming through every cubic centimeter of her being as she scooped at its head curating a coworkers trip to flushing the joy of discovering xiao long bao flickering onto each of their faces like so many fireflieswhen i came to tatsusan was smiling at me yet again is it ok he askedyou want evocations of the food itself forget it that is beyond my ken but know this the ridiculous variety of fish is a red herring who chooses eateries by menu length even its freshness is beside the point no sushi yasudas claim to the firmament is its incredible rice a thunderclap that has not lost a decibel in the absence of its founding chef to order sashimi would be to forfeit a glimpse into eternitymaybe this hasnt been much of a review per se maybe its just me sobbing into my keyboard but if you care about food if you care about anything before shuffling off this mortal coil you owe it to yourself to come hereprobability of return within year or impossible to calculate come back after a lifechanging experience sushi yasuda is a lifechanging experience the next woman i bring there will be one i intend to spend the rest of my life with

sometimes i like to eat in the shady parts of chinatownmy friend warned me with apologies and concern you know its not the nicest looking restaurant its kind of dingythats okay im there for the food not for the fact that its on open table or is michelin starreda solo bearded man eats in the corner devouring his bowl of noodles the group of women sit and make trays and trays of dumplings old chinese men gossip over dinner a not so random group of food gluttons take over tables this is a typical scene at sheng wang im not sure who is the loudest of all definitely not the solo bearded man but i can tell he wants to shout to the high heavens how good his soup isi love sheng wang i dream of having a whole plate of dumplings all all to myself i want to slurp their peanut butter noodles for i want to have a bowl of peeled noodles as opposed to the hand pulled i like the peeled noodles so much better they are like wonton wrappers dissolved and so soft you dont even have to chew i like food that is effortless i like the taste of their broth soup that has been sitting on the stove for hours and beef that has been stewed until tender i like biting into my fishball and finding a porkball say what i want to one day find a ducks foot at the bottom of my bowl kinda gross but like a rabbits foot i think it is good luck i think it is also funny that the duck hand pulled noodle soup is described as taco perhaps they really meant taro but does that sound like a typical chinese combination as wellif youre a superficial person stay away from my sheng wang it may look dirty or sketchy from the outside but the truth is that it is really clean inside and the service is great this is a lunch or dinner for sure and i love it i also like living on the edge or outskirts of chinatown i hear the lower east side is pretty trendy these days

in the past there are a few places in the chinatown in manhattan that you could find malaysian styled jerky they were always a delicious but slightly expensive treat over the years the establishments that sells these jerky dwindled and now i could think of two places that still makes and sells these one of them is this tiny store between the edge of chinatown and the beginning of whats left of little italywhen i say small i meant small youll be lucky to squeeze in people into the space between the wall and the counter where you place your order this aforementioned glass counter is where they put all of the selections of the jerky that they have on display despite their name of malaysia beef jerky they also carry dried meat made of chicken and porkbesides the meat they have two styles of jerky one the sliced beef and pork are more familiar to the american palate of beef jerky dry tough and tasty the other style the more malaysian one is thinner semi moist and slightly sweet with a slight smoky aftertaste each version of the malaysian styled ones have a spicy variation that have only the slightest hint of heat in them there are two things you should to know about these jerky before hand one they charge by pound and at to per pound the price would add up fast usually people buy by quarter pounds but it is easy to go slightly above the requested weight that you ask fortwo the semi moist jerky although really tasty doesnt stay put as well as the dried variety its best to place them in the fridge unless you plan to eat them all within a day or two which considering how delicious they are could easily happen despite your best efforts not to
i have been looking for a place of zen for a very long time now i never really actually believed that it would exist but i have found it in new york city of all places i was recommended by a friend in yoga two weeks ago of a wellness center meets chiropractic services and medical spa everything i need to make myself whole again i was working hours every weekend and some weekdays i had strained my lower back and built plenty of muscle tension in my shoulders from carrying loads of heavy equipment my first visit was last wednesday my experience was so pleasant from the minute i walked in the dim lit wellness center made me feel relaxed and ready with no expectations of what would begin or end i was greeted by a nice receptionist and she lead me to my first examination with dr joe caracillo he is a noted chiropractor popular yoga instructor and respected health expert in my mind i knew i was in good hands because i use to read cosmopolitan magazines and he would give some insightful advice on different yoga positions my exam started out with a back neck and jaw adjustment i never realized that i clench my jaw in my sleep and he made me aware of it he also attached a russian muscle therapy machine to my lower back to help alleviate any tension i was having immediately i could feel the tingling and buzzing that cured any issues i was havingafter my examination and chiropractic treatment i was sent downstairs for my massage with eviee she was this sweet soft spoken asian girl that i never expected would of made me feel again the massage was minutes long and she worked on all the knots i had in my lower back and my shoulders it was a mix of deep tissue and shiatsu style after the massage i was realizing i could get use to this maybe once a week she left the room and when i exited the room i was greeted by her and an organic avenue veggie elixir drink i was extremely impressed when i went upstairs to check out dr joe was there to ask me how much i enjoyed my first visit he also mentioned that organic avenue is a participant in his wellness spa and any drinks can be ordered prior to your treatment they also stock up on a couple as well i have never been to a spa that treats you that good with organic goodies on wednesday i was interested in trying pilates so i booked a session of pilates with fabricia my yoga friend said that she was the best in new york and she definitely lived up to her reputation i tried a combination of yoga and pilates before called yogalates but never this true method i actually used the pilates machine with her and tried all these different stretching pulling and pushing methods i never knew my body could handle but it did one thing i still had to work on though was my shoulders they sort of have a mind of its own all i had to think was relaxation time and i improved significantly she recommended that i come in the next day for a massage to loosen up soreness thursday i booked a massage with matt he has very limited availability at space for wellness that is because he is very popular and usually takes a couple weeks to book a session with him hes in that high demand i dubbed him magical matt because the minute i met him i knew his presence was exactly what i needed to relax his calming voice and his selection of music went with the flow of the massage the strength and use of his fingers and palms of his hands made me imagine ocean waves against my back he worked out every tension i had and i felt like a whole new improved me after the session i was given organic avenue blueberry smoothie with sprutilna so yummy and perfect for hydration i think i could totally get use to thisrealizing that they have facebook specials at during the week you know i am going to make this a weekly trip an treat myself to maintaining my health and well being

justice delayed is justice denied i have never thought that this would apply to cupcakes but in this case it certainly does for what freedom loving individual entitled to the pursuit of lifeliberty and happiness does not wonder why it took so long for sprinkles to grace the shores of the island of new york wait why am i writing this way i think i may have watched too many john adams and thomas jefferson this summer seriously we have been content lining up for dry cupcakes all these years when sprinkles was actually our just desserts at any rate guided by the imagined voices of candace nelson and of oprah winfrey i handed for each cupcake to secure my justice in the following flavors chocolate coconut in my opinion the hands down winner moist perfect for summer as it brings vision of faraway tropical islands shimmering in the distance with azure skies and white sand the only way this can possibly be improved is to toast the coconut salty caramel sweet and moist which sweetness is cut by the salt on the caramel frosting red velvet smells heavenly and fresh the best that i have tasted lime key lime pie that is a cake soft fragrant not too sweet you know what im saying and lemon which i got for free by saying sunny day the rainbow sprinkles almost made me refrain from eating it it was moist but to my mind i want more lemon flavor justice is sweet and sprinkles does liberate you from the dryness of other unjust cupcakes and just to make sure that aspca does not sue for its own justice sprinkles has minicupcakes for dogs in addition to their calendar of seasonal cupcakes and the cupcake ottoman the dog cupcakes literally take the cupcake i mean the cake
maison premiere is like a smooth talking debonair gentleman that sweeps you off your feet before you even know it with his high class charm and piercing gaze he manages to have you paralyzed speechless and under his spell in no time this is what mp was like for me we were greeted at the door by a hostess who was so striking that i couldnt concentrate for a few minutes her intense stare and brilliant red lipstick led me into a trance it felt like a dreary night in london and how lovely to tuck into a speakeasy where everything is a secret and so the culinary affair with maison beginsthe place is dimly lit and oddly enough time stood still at the horseshoeshaped bar with bartenders in suspenders and absinthe fountain creates an french quarter scene we were seated right across from the bar and my the space was cozy definitiely a great place to get upclose and personal with that intimate person in your life our waiter ever so kind and personable took our drink orders i opted for a santa maria cooler it is made with rum sherry lemon and pineapple syrup a sharp and clean drink and not too sweet this is a raw bar so dont expect to find anything cooked or any meat you are here for the seafood and trust me this place is well worth it we shared the la petit maison platter red snapper ceviche and also had additional oysters when the plate arrived i immediately fell in love i have never seen an arrangement so beautiful and so sexy the food was amazing and if you love raw oysters you have to come here the red snapper was excellent i am usually very wary of red snapper as it has a rough consistency but this ceviche was on point tasty and fresh come here for fresh seafood and of the highest quality i also had an absinthe drink bitches breaux strong and by the end of my drink i was on my way to hallucinations the waiter did manage to spill water all over my suede boots but thats ok he made everything better with complimentary glasses of vueve a brilliant smile and polite manners this was one of the best experiences i have had in a long while i highly recommend it take a date here or anyone that means a lot to you it will heighten the feelings i know i was swimming in love by the end of the night
worth every pennyif you have an extra laying aroundyes i scrounged pennies from my piggy bank to spend one glorious afternoon at the spa at the mandarin oriental after lugging my sack of change through the hot sweaty streets of manhattan i was ready for the cool respite of the floor high above the throngs of grossy people you are greeted at the front desk with tea and spa slippers before you walk back for a tour of the treatment rooms and water therapy room i picked the spa because i had a hankering for a jacuzzi and water therapy pretreatment i feel in love love love with the water therapies at the wailea resort in maui and was looking to recreate a teensy bit of that experience in nyc knowing that teensyness would apply to the size of any spa in nyc i was overjoyed to find a wadein jacuzzi pool one side has an immersed chaise lounge built of metal tubes you can have a lie down on the metal tubes and the jets and bubbles come from underneath you so youre nestled in a jettybubblyupliftingrollicking water bed of actual water i did not move for minutes until my treatment startedthe spa is not a place to cheap out so i opted for the hour time treatment where you basically customize your hour treatment i ended up opting with their suggestions i started with a body scrubfirst a brush down with a hard brush then a slathering of minty exfoliating rub an allover minimassage to smooth out your skin after a quick hop in the en suite shower i had a long luxurious traditional massage with some sports massage thrown in to ease my tired muscles followed by a facial massage not a real facial i dont do those and a scalp masage during the hour treatment i entered a zenlike blissful state not quite sleeping and not quite dreaming but just luxuriating in the warm enveloping feeling of having my muscles pulled and prodded into mush afterwards i napped in the relaxation room sipping orange water noshing on dried apricots and nuts watching the leaves blossom in central park then headed to the locker room to slowly dress and return to reality my skin was smooth my muscles melty my mind blank as i was whisked down the elevator to the hot mean streets of manhattanand msg for hockeywhere i promptly lost all zen in chanting fight fight fightthis girl would make the manadarin a monthlymustdo if it werent for having to haul all those troublesome pennies
with battery park as my starting point all the way up to midtown the running path up hudson river park is quickly becoming one of my all time favorite routes for my training runs why is this as good at it gets well here are a few of the many reasons separate runningwalking and bike lanes amazing view of the river and jersey well as amazing as jersey can look i guess when the sun is setting speaking of the river the ability to run literally right next to it at certain places on the route never seems to be overly crowded clean available restrooms that are did i mention this already clean fantastic view of downtown if youre running from north to south or alternatively fantastic view of midtown if youre running from south to norththere are many more that im sure im forgetting right now but it doesnt matter this should be more than enough to convince you that im right this park is awesome and can be your favorite too whether you are a runner walker biker rollerblader etc
on a tuesday night this tiny bar is super pleasant because there will only be a nonpda couple out of your field of vision at a table in the seating area and a dude weirder than you at the opposite end of the bar he will have body odor but it will be mild and you will know that the smell is not inherent to the establishmentyou will then essentially be alone to take out your copy of atlas shrugged and do your obligatory reading of ayn rand without feeling pretentious while you wait for someone who might or might not actually show upthe attentive bartender will give his advice if you ask for it he will let you taste the campari if you admit that you havent had the stuff on your tongue since you were in the caribbean pouring it into a full can of pineapple soda to avoid being caught by the chaperones of the marine biology program you were there forthe drink will be or more but will be so stiff that you wont even think of the next one for a long long timejust a warning a chat with a friend a shared speckled old hen and a few new order songs on the goodsongsonly loaded jukebox may result in making out in the street but then again no one will really be around so its like the tree that falls without anyone to hear it

last year i worked at a veterans hospital providing counseling for men and women who had recently returned from iraq and afghanistan and were suffering from ptsd depression and substance abuse it was an incredibly intense experience it also gave me a renewed appreciation for the men and women who serve in the military what war looks like from an individual perspective and how challenging it is to return to real life after living through a war i have never had more respect than i do now for the men and women i served during my time at that hospitalnow it is midnighti walk arm in arm with a friend to honor those who perished in the vietnam war it is an occasion for silenceice and snow crunch underfoot as we wind our way through the quiet streets it is a welcome reprieve from the typical hustle and bustle of downtown nyc which leaves little room to breathe let alone to pay your respectsthe pathway is lined with the names of veterans inscribed in steel plaques the glass sculpture to which it leads stands tall filled with a glowing internal light we stand in the snow and read the letters aloud letters from soldiers to mothers brothers wives children who they will never see again i think about how history repeats itself i stare at the perfect icicles that hang from the top of the monument and watch as they sparkle in the night light i think about how lucky i amif you have never been it is worth a visit to see this beautiful sculpture a testament to all of those who have served and to remember them

indulging in a food centric vision of the afterlife i can easily see an eternity at del posto as a reward for having led a life of trying new cuisines writing helpful reviews and being an elite yelper and id gladly order from the five course menu again and again an eternal recurrence of the same exceptional experience that marked my recent birthdayinstead of being welcomed to the pearly gates by st peter i was instead literally asked by the legendary lidia bastianich how my meal was who happened to be dining about feet away from our table as she made the roundswas this a test failure to properly answer results in an eviction from paradise where i must forever make my own meals and never dine out againi mustered up my courage and replied that everything was excellent and that i really enjoyed her shows a gracious nod thank you and smile and heaven on a plate resumedso del posto is a bastianichbatali joint a massive restaurant in the meatpacking district that literally means instead of thanks google translatewhich is apparently entirely off the place is more like ittheres no a la carte ordering from the menu youll either order from the five course or seven the man entrusted to explain our menu items was a passionate purveyor of culinary information venturing into the origins of our food preparation and other details that was music to my ears fine dining meet wikipedia and i loved itthis is the kind of restaurant where your napkin is changed by a staff member equipped with napkin removing tongs and if you need to get up and use the restroom someone quickly swarms by to inch the table out so you dont have toi started with lidias lobster salad light lobster flavors for the summer supplemented by tomato and celery this was an appropriate start to an epic meal my wife had a plate of prosciutto di parma as her antipasti which i gladly assisted in devouringbut my most enthusiastic discovery was the application of a lardo spread to bread butter my friend your days are marked as the topping of choice pure fat pure decadence and pure tongue flavor explosionup next were the pasta plates each person chooses a plate which is presented to both people dining i opted for the ricotta pansoti with green and white asparagus black truffle butter pansoti best resembles a ravioli and literally means little belly my belly became a bigger one after relishing the sheeps milk ricotta filling this was a rich pasta dish but fortunately the portion wasnt overwhelming up next was my wifes pick of spaghetti with dungeness crab sliced jalapeno minced scallion you could definitely experience the heat of jalapeno with this dish i also enjoyed the minced scallion adding a crispiness to experience that i hadnt experienced before while eating spaghetti my main course was an order of baby lamb alla romana garlic yogurt with ceci swiss chard ragu a milkfed lamb between six and eight weeks old im sure this would be a target of a peta campaign ethics aside this was some of the most tender lamb ive ever experienced offering no resistance while chewing the ceci chickpeas and chard ragu were the perfect complement to this particular meat having survived four courses and nearly full i was relieved to see that my butterscotch semifreddo sour cherries preserved melon agrumata crumbled sbrisolona milk jam was not an overpowering mass the dessert may be semi frozen but it was all good as i savored each spoonful we were also given a box that included two small italian donuts a caramel with edible rice wrapper lollipops and a few other tiny sweet treatsnearly three hours later it was finishedfor a special occasion dining experience del posto exceeded my expectations you dont go here for a typical red sauce experience but for fine italian dining meets french presentation and service this was a stellar gift that my wife gave me and i am eternally grateful
at cafe kiev courses are the most important part bring a bunch of friends move the tables together and order as much as possible i was lucky enough to be dining with one ukrainian for this meal and a few other friends so we let him do the ordering and settled in for a good night three hours later we were practically needing to roll ourselves down kings highway when we leftthe small dining room just off the main road is trying hard to be trendy and sleek but fails just enough in a very awkwardly good way to make you feel comfortable for your homecooking the odd color scheme glass chandeliers maps of kiev and ukraine and various random art as well as tables of russian and ukrainianspeaking groups make this a legitimate excursion spot even before you look at the menuthe order seemed a tad strange but i present the meal as it was presented to uscourse and bugenina the solenya is a grouping of cabbage and onions and pickles really just a way to get your mouth warmed upthe bugenina was listed on the specials board so i was a bit surprised to see it come out on the first round it is a cold dish though and is served with some very special russian wasabe a beet and horseradish mixture that really added a nice pop to the slices of we were finishing up the first dishes two more arrived in the form of the fresh cabbage and cucumber salad and the salad olivie the former looked amazing but had a bit less taste than expected never fear a dash of salt and pepper and a squeeze of the lemon was zest enough i think it could have stood a more liberal sprinkling of dill as wellthe olivie was a very familiar taste like a potato salad and egg salad in one it was thoroughly laced with mayonaise but not overwhelmingly rich somehow the ukrainian amongst us commented that it was like eating another familys olivie simply saying it was not like moms we all sort of tasted it and probably were a little afraid to admit our pleasure seeing as how low class we might have felt but the dish disappeared quite rapidly third round was devoted to soups and we sampled three the first to arrive was the kharcho which i overheard described simply with it needs more crap in it dark red broths usually lead to amazing results so i think all of our expectations were built up very high the soup is good but definitely the weakest of the three given how good it can bea definite winner was the frikadelki a chicken meatball soup with an excellent thin broth the firm meatballs were good for cutting up and sharing eating alone or with the broth if it were my bowl i would have even gone so far as to place a big dollop of sour cream inside of itluckily i was able to do just this with the third soup we sampled borshch this was my handsdown favorite of the round and had me smiling from its not too beety but just beety enough deliciousness this general good mood lasted for a nice digestive intermission before the next foods started started getting real serious the moment our two plates of vareniki wmeat wpotatoes and mushrooms arrived these little guys were the real deal nothing like you will find frozen and thawed in hipster eastern european restaurants in cobble hillalthough the cabbage was a bit soggy an unfortunate consequence of not making them right when ordered the golubtsy were otherwise spot on bursting with flavor unlike any other restaurantbought version these stuffed cabbage rolls were very goodour final entree was the meat cutlets two beefvealchicken patties served with buckwheat this is not actually an accompaniment option but we had an insider who asked for it instead of the available home fries mashed potatoes or rice this made for a far more interesting no room in our stomachs left the table made the bold decision to order more out came an odd rendition of baklava and a nice pancake dish served with strawberries and bananas below the edges of the pancakes were nicely crispy something i had never seen beforeeven if you do not order dessert go ahead with a pot of tea which is served like you see it below with sugar lemons and a bowl of sour cherries these cherries are good for eating alone or with the pancakes but also are traditionally dropped into the tea themselves the syrup of them sweeten the tea enough so you dont need the sugar cubes which are not supposed to go into the tea but rather held between the teeth as you drink so that the tea passes through itthe whole ensemble and process of this tea time was very rewarding and felt good we ended up prolonging our stay by at least minutes because of it as we poured second and third glasses we were told stories of the golden gate of kiev and the horse chestnut the citys official flower

i can think of none other for review that deserves this more right now than death company pure and classic bartending that is an art form and deserves to be praiseddark and brooding like the vampire lestat sipping on a typeo blood cocktail hidden away in a shadowy corner death company is appropriately named for those of us who prefer to shun the light and move between the dimmed view of candle light no one knows you are there yet your presence can be felt by the glowing stare of your eyes as you partake in classic cocktail enjoymenta speakeasy in the traditional sense black velvet ropes to part as you enter dark and candle lit low level music soft chatter emanating from the couples and groups sitting in booths around you bartender working like a mad scientist perfecting his potions the occasional quiet din is broken up by his exuberant shaking of a cocktail yes this is a perfect place for those who abhor the modern bar scene in this wretched yet addictive and wonderful cityterrific cocktail menu set up in categories of gin rum tequila whiskey brandy hops and juleps there are also options for classic drinks champagne drinks punch bowls wines and few craft type beers if you are a bit hungry there is a selection of gourmet appetizer dishes and small entree plates that are also outstanding everything we drank and ate were made with inspiration and aplomb looking back the word outstanding is the one that comes to the forefront of my mind as an appropriate description no reservations are accepted no groups over seven people first come first serve if no seats are available when you arrive they take your number and will call you when there is an opening best to arrive early after it first opens and enjoy a long stay there otherwise you might be waiting for up to an hour for a seat we got there right after it opened and were seated immediately i will return here again if just to sit like a mysterious figure in a dark corner and enjoy a perfect libation while observing the denizens of the shadow time

im no stranger to cart food but i was wondering how the shawarma here could be so much better than average now i wonder how its possible to eat twice your body weight without dyingthe chicken platter came in a container piled high with tons of chicken white sauce lettuce tomato yellow rice and even some unordered falafel it was sat in one of the plastic chairs in the parking lot and shoveled chicken in my face behind an unmarked van i felt like a chicken pedophile i tried to leave some leftovers for tomorrowi just got home and ended up inhaling the rest while listening to rhythmic music and angrysounding arabic chants on their websitethis was the juiciest most flavorful shawarma i think ive ever had long live the king
after wandering around from each vintage shop to shop i think ive finally found my goto vintage shop let me tell you the journey had a few bumps some of the shops had either too ancient items that goes back to the overpriced used items or grandma clothingbut is different you can find good i mean good brand name items still with tags on them on the rack or rack or on the racks what a steal the jewelryaccessories pan is always delightful to go through the moment you walk in youll receive a warm welcome by none other than kate the shop is tiny but great as well which is something you rarely find in most vintage stores that smell like dead rats or something old the and rack is always there which is always tempting for me to walk out with something i recently got my mother a brand new tocca blazer for only has everything for everyone whether you prefer a more conservative mature jackie o look to plain old basic shirts

i never would have found telepan without yelp as its neatly tucked away on st with a very unassuming entrance but boy am i glad i dideverything about telepan was top class from the service to the ambiance and of course the food do yourself a favor and pony up the dough around if memory serves for the tasting menu youll be glad you did the portions are relatively small but with four delicious dishes its enough to fill you right upi started with the vegetablebread soup which was a light soup with a piece of bread soaking at the top it kind of reminded me of a french onion soup but without the wicked breathfor the midcourse it was lobster bolognese a spaghetti in light tomato sauce with a chunk of lobster meat on top the pasta was great and the lobster fell out of the shell and melted in my mouthmy main course which in reality wasnt any larger than any of the other courses was the roasted chicken which was the most tender piece of chicken ive ever eaten in my life i barely needed a knife to cut it as it practically fell apart at the touch of a fork the gnocchis on the side were also amazingbut as usual the meals highlight was dessert telepan smore eat it wow a dark chocolate brownie on the bottom a giant toasted marshmallow in the middle and graham cracker ice cream on top oh good god was it awesomemy wonderful date and i also shared a reasonblypriced bottle of white wine and our total bill including a tip for excellent service was just over not a bad deal for such a great meal rhymes telepan is great and since they open at pm for dinner that gives you more than enough time to have a great meal before heading down to lincoln center for a little culture i definitely want smore of telepan
my expectations were high and they were met i will keep this review short but sweet is it worth the hype oh yes i believe so service outstanding our every request was honored and the staff went above and beyond to make us happy i was very very impressedfood delicious i loved almost everything from the seared tuna appetizer to the palette cleanser especially the peppermint ice cream served with dessert the only thing that actually wasnt good to me was the chocolate souffle i just didnt care for it but our waiter more than made up for that by stuffing me with cotton candy and various chocolates from the bon bon bar also brought me more ice cream i was a happy girl presentation was also really nice portions were satisfying as wellambiance this is a great place to come celebrate a special occasion although we were not most of the people around us were its got a very welcoming atmosphere too not too stuffy and very elegant at the same time great for a romantic night outthe only thing that would have made this better would be if gordon ramsay was actually there otherwise a wonderful experience and recommend doing the splurge definitely earned their michelin stars here
ive eaten here so many times that i got to be the duchess woohoo so i figured it was high time for me to write a review im going to keep this one short and sweet because im pretty boring when i eat here i sit at the bar because there is more room than when you sit at the tables and the bartenders are cool and they take extra special care of you also i order the same thing every time i visit im a creature of comfort what can i saytedd the bartender is awesome but hes not always behind the bar the rest of the bartenders are really nice too but tedd is my favorite im a big fan of the jalape√±o quencher drink see photo also ask tedd about the death by chocolate two desserts and a drink combo that we created and prepare for the yummiest chocolate overload everthe oysters at aquagrill are the best that ive found in the city which is why this is a popular favorite amongst other aphrodisiac lovers my personal favorites are the blue points and the wellfleets of which both pair perfectly with the kaori sake my favorite dish on the menu is the grilled yellowfin tuna with crispy jasmine rice cakes and wok seared vegetables in a ginger peanut sauce cravings for all the good food and drinks that aquagrill serves up come every so often hence my earning the coveted duchess title now dont anyone try anything funny and try to usurp my title and even attempt to take that groovy crown next to all of my checkins away or i will shuck you up wocka wocka wocka and thats my cheesy joke for the day folks ill quit while i am behind cane pulls me off stage
you want fresh seafood sabrys has got itits a rare experience to be able to enter an egyptian restaurant and find a menu entirely devoted to seafood its just that seafood the menu is not cluttered with crowd pleasing middle eastern dishes such as falafel or kebabs the waitstaff also doesnt make a hard sell on the restaurants short list of tagines or dips naw this place is all about seafoodso serious that when you choose your fish be it salmon red snapper porgie tilapia or branzini you go up to the display case and pick out your actual fish servedwhole and lounging amongst other catchesoftheday on a bed of ice what you see is what you get you can have it any way simply grilled fried or barbecued egyptian style with blackened spices on the skin and the organs still intact you can also ask them to remove the organs i love the straightforwardness of this placebranzini prepared in a traditional bbq was served as a whole fish with meaty white flesh not flaky but tender and rubbed with blackened egyptian spices on the exterior mixed seafood tagine was a nice complement to the greater meal a simple stew of tomatoes and garlic cradling tender pieces of calamari and plump shrimp tails seafoodentreefortwo was a whitesauce stew of clams white fish lobster and mussels it was priced at but its portion size was more than adequate to feed four people nothing was boring here and for the price per person you cant beat it
almost seems like stealing it must have the perfect storm of awesome because this day could not have been better sunny day minimal crowds baby baboons sea lion feeding sheep shearing taking pictures as a turtle poisonous frog eggs monkeys with mustachesim pretty sure the only thing that would have made it better is if they had let me ride the emu sure the zoo may not have the glamorous animals like lions and elephants but those animals have giant turds that lead to giant smells that i hate the intimate nature of this zoo makes the experience much more exciting than seeing another lion taking a nap behind plexiglas again if they let you ride the lionwhole nother story
i admit it im a wretched snob i judge based on looks and make a snap decision in under a minute brasilianville cafe grill with its nondescript awning just wasnt cutting it i barely skimmed a glanced at it before relegating it into the category of places whose threshold i shall never cross besides it was a buffet and with the exception of a couple things im not a buffet girl buffets conjure up too many memories of bad food sitting out and you have to serve yourself i like having people wait on me thats how i roll but after reading rave reviews from suanne l lara g and jeff o i had to reconsider perhaps i might be gasp wrong the earth just shifted its axis in shocklet me tell you how wrong i was i ate there three times in one week and i would have gone there more often if i hadnt been staying at work really late yes its a buffet but i swear that youve never had buffet food this good because its great food period not great buffet food but great food they have a wide selection that changes every day they always have rice and beans some different kinds of chicken some kind of spare ribs and some different kinds of beef and a salad bar no matter what they have the food is always phenomenal i cant remember everything i ate and sometimes i didnt know what i ate but it was always really really good the chicken was fork tender we didnt need a knife to cut it the brisket was delicious i loved the gravy the brasilian chicken pot pie was incredible i couldnt identify everything in it but who cares when it was sooo good and melted in your mouth the corn bread was sweet and was more like the sweet moist mexican cornbread than the dry american breadlike version i had an event that i was running and needed it to be catered we didnt have a large budget but i needed to feed a reasonable crowd for a low price and thats when i thought brasilianville would come through they were willing to work with me and let me come a half hour before they opened to pick up the food they even got the cashier to come in early just for me i got a little bit of everything because i wasnt sure what the students were willing to eat the students never had brasilian food before and they were highly suspicious of it but they had been welltrained to just take a little bit to try it with much trepidation everyone took one or two bites of everything after they took one bite they leaped out of their seats to get more like me they were converted to the glory that the brasilianville cafe you pay by weight but honestly the prices are really reasonable and cheap considering how much food and great meat you get was enough for two meals for me ymmv this isnt a fancy place nor is it haute cuisine but it is just really wonderful down home comfort food of brasilian descent the first time i was there a regular greeted cheerfully and said that he had been brought there at first by a brasilian friend of his and they had been going to brasilianville cafe for years you rock my socks brasilianville why leave astoria when the world is here in my own little neighborhood
even the nice girls like to wreak havoc and shoot up every once in a while for sport of course not death and getting the chance to do that at wsrpr gave this nice gal a whirlwind of excitement thanks to my boyfriend and a heavily discounted yelp coupon a group of of us came here last friday night to get our hands on some live firearms theres no option of gun selection its the law you get a semiautomatic rifle that loads bullets in the guns magazine we sat for about half an hour in a small classroom for some preliminary instructions by our badass guide howard on how to handle the gun load the bullets fire it and disable it howard was extremely thorough and funny in flashes and though he looked really tough like he served in an army brigade turned out he is actually some sort of computer nerd of course this fact does not take away from the reality that hes exceptional with a gun and can probably kill you color that fascinating if you are looking to do something exhilarating then look no further i myself got such an adrenaline kick off of shooting this gun aiming directly in the concentric black circles at that center black target and shooting off bullets all while no one was harmed in the process most important part you can move your target around as in pushing it as far back as you think will challenge your aim you feel safe bc each stall is protected from your neighboring gunwielder and you can focus solely on pointing and shooting your firearm its tremendous fun i got a few bullseyes and that was a great feeling if you ever have some anger issues you might want to take it out here at the gun range its all for sport and you get to run your rage on a piece of paper winwin
the next great thing to happen to the word flex the first was the reggae song by mad cobra that i used to dance to in middle school ahhh the good ol daysanyway its extremely rare that my husband cant stop talking about a restaurant and even more rare when he insists upon a speedy return for that alone i would grant flex mussels the coveted stars but what sealed the deal is the fact that i thought it was really amazing toowe dropped in without a reservation and immediately found a nice table outside our waiter was possibly the most bubbly man ive ever encountered in my life very energetic and knowledgeable i dare say the rare specimen of restaurant staff that actually enjoys his job or fakes it really well like i used to when i worked as a waitress guys jeez get your mind outta the gutter hubby ordered the parma mussels and i got the bisque my food philosophy when it comes to my marriage is whats his is mine and whats mine is mine i played the marriage card during our meal reaching over the table so much to dip my bread into that parmigiana creamy goodness that he finally just gave me his mussels and took mine which were also amazing he jumped the gun and ordered fries thinking the mussels wouldnt be enough the fries were good but we definitely didnt need them but the topping on the freaking cake was the dessert whats better than whoopie pie that would be deep fried whoopie pie oozing with melted cream cheese and crusted with white chocolate cream and because were both fat bastards we also got the the flex donut collection which allows you to select four donuts out of eight choices if memory serves we got the cinnamon sugar the salted caramel the fluffernutter and the chocolate do you know what heaven tastes like that would be perfectly light donuts filled with gooey sweet fillings i couldnt pick a favorite one tasted better than the otherthe only thing i wish was that there was some sort of flight option which would let you try three or four different types of mussels there are simply too many that look amazing to not return to try each one oh the choices the choices

some people think openminded people do yoga or maybe the truly tolerant and zen are unitarian universalists perhaps the bravest adventurers expand their minds with lsdnoyou can do all of those things but if you dont eat at takashi then youre no ballstothewalls bourdain bear with no ceilings youre just a foodie with quotesthe culinary gods do not bless people who eat a fancy cheeseburgerif you have a true passion for amazing trips youd take the tongue experience the tasty morsels were better than some steaks ive eaten in my life and who doesnt love cooking the meat on a grill in front of you sometimes when people express a dish to be subtle they really mean it has no flavor i would say that this dish is subtle because the flavoring and texture speak with an equal voice mmm twisted tongue jokethe other dishes we had whether it be the peppered edamame or other assorted offal carried that same spirit of deft delicious excellence there was no homestyle slapdash of inconsistency it was such a beautiful interesting and delicious meal that i really felt this restaurant was on another inspired level
my friends and i came here to celebrate our friends bday gotta give her props for coming up with this unique activity this is definitely a fun offthebeatenpath way to spend an afternoon and at for unlimited shooting not a bad deal either since the guys who run this place do it on the side theyre pretty much only open weeknights and weekend afternoons its a very nofrills atmosphere basically just a big room with targets on one side and equipment seating and bathrooms on the otherit seemed that most of the other people there were avid shooters many with their own bows and arrows and man did those bows look supremely badass i was impressed with the variety in size and style when we first arrived we were a little intimidated and definitely stuck out like sore thumbs as newbies but the regulars didnt pay much attention to us everyone was pretty focused on their own shootingand focus is a good thing when there are people with deadly weapons in their hands guy one of the coowners whos a long island detective joked that thats why he carries his handgunyou just never know we were surprised when he handed us off to his young daughter valerie to give us our tutorial even though she looks more like a gymnast than an archer dont let her looks fool you for one thing shes older than she looks something i can totally relate to on top of that shes very informative knowledgeableand badass this was proven when she took her turn shooting some arrows the bow was taller than her but she totally commanded it we were all in awe as was guy who proudly compared her to hit girl from that kickass moviewe ended up spending five hours shooting and had a great time chatting up guy valerie and even befriending one of the kids whose dad had brought him unfortunately there isnt much in the way of snacks so if you intend on spending a few hours here bring your own food they let you eat at the tables its a really laidback welcoming place with nice people running it so if youve ever wanted to try archery this is the place to go and maybe you can feel a little badass yourself for a couple of hours
oh my godi dont do drugs wasnt ever into it so when i liken something to crack i am only pulling from what i have seen in movies and ya know word on the street lukes crack there is a very small group of restaurants in this city that i would call eating there a religious experience after trying lukes recently i knew i had found jesus in the form of a flavorful buttery fresh lobster roll im salivating right now are you let me explain the megadeliciousness that is lukes lobster heaven i added that last word it seemed appropriate i walked on into this casual little lobster shack on the upper east side i was all jazzed about trying it since the hype was spreading across nyc like wildfires spread through california i ordered a taste of maine at the suggestion of my dining companion who has been a patron of lukes since it opened plus i know her food choices are pretty solid so i trusted her and never looked back i cleaned my plate like actually was licking my fingers and making horribly annoying mmmm noises as i ate the lobster and shrimp rolls were my favorite and the crab was also stellar and everything was seasoned with magical fairy dust and just a touch of mayo the buns were all buttery and lightly toasted i mean if anything was ever perfectit would be these lobster rolls i dont know what they put in those rolls but i can assure you that is filled with sugar and spice and everything nice i dont know if the above review is enough for you to go in and try it for yourself but every day you wait to try it out is a day that is wasted and you can never get back think about that the next time you make a dinner decision the only downside you will crave it all the time lobster roll win
you want to go to williamsburg for dinner you i cant believe itlook making fun of hipsters is so been there done that im at peace nowthis conversation gave me pause for thought while debating my rating on the one hand i was advocating moving beyond appearances yet on the other i couldnt escape the suspicion that i was getting carried away by the ambiance at tabaremy first visit had been spurred by the glowing reviews of laura a sarah w and peter d now i may discount peter ds reviews as his profile headline screams escape from responsibility when youre young there are no mistakes only research but i take star reviews from laura and sarah seriously so i will echo lauras description of tabare rustic style but sophisticated and yes trendy too its charming the lighting is beautiful you will feel comfortable its cozy its sexy you can fall in love ok thats where i draw the line no amount of mood lighting or sexy atmosphere can send me running to read shakespeare or keats its whats on the inside that counts so lets talk about the food now thats where the relationship gets complicated the extent to which uruguayan cuisine is influenced by italian spanish and portugese cuisines is surprising to one not too familiar with it i debated for a while on what to order looking for something different but ultimately going with the empanadas caramelized onions gruyere fontina cheese and chicken onions and peppers and the handmade ravioli of the day goat cheese ricotta sun dried tomato butter sage sauce i got a taste of the things to come with the warm bread basket that was accompanied with homemade tapenade and orange zest simple but well executed that was the theme of the entire meal the empanadas were so different thicker but not heavier in texture from any ive had in new york that the next morning i engaged my puerto rican colleague in a long debate on this the olive oil based dipping sauces served as the perfect accompaniment till the taste buds were wowed by the ravioli which must also rank as one of the best ive had and italian is one of my favorite cuisinesi was also surprised by the alfajor as the ones ive had in the restaurants and bakeries in jackson heights are fairly consistent in their interpretation with each of the dulce de leche filled cookies being of an inch thick the version at tabare had cracker thin crisp cookies with dulce de leche chocolate ganache and sea salt caramelized walnuts it was different and i liked it but i appreciated the dule de leche flan more as it had a mousse like texture i was fascinated with the way the flan wraps around the fork as you slice it down alternating the grace of a ballerina with the sensuality of a stripper working the pole this reverie was interrupted by ecstatic sounds from the table next to me upon being offered complimentary flan the owners grandmothers recipe that has to be my pet peeve with tabare three visits and not a single complimentary appetizer or dessert when almost every table with female patrons has been rewardedi would protest at the discrimination if it werent for the work ethic dedication attentiveness of the owners as they bring you water serve you food make recommendations clean the table one can only wish them well and hope that they succeed in their hamlet away from the village tabareultimately when all elements food service atmosphere and value per head come together how can one hold back ones affection sometimes attraction is as much a result of how similar something is to what one knows as it is about how different it is especially if thoughtfulness ensures perfect execution on the details i kid
initially when i first came in i was not impressed for one no one seemed to be manning the counter or paying any attention to new customers coming in we stood at the counter for a good minutes before anyone cared to talk to us the clerk at the front seemed a bit overwhelmed and apathetic at the same time while we were waiting patiently a man comes from the back and walks toward the counter he greets us and is extremely friendly i got a good vibe from him and with things like body art it is important to feel a good vibe i told him what i wanted and he immediately said it was no problem in fact he was also working on a similar symbol for another client we agreed to an appointment for the next day the next day arrives and we show up as soon as they open it did take awhile before my appointment actually got started but i am ok with that this isnt a dentists office all i can say is jeb maykut is awesome artistic warm and professional jeb made sure to tell me that he was a licensed body artist and also that the store met all regulations for body art which includes an infection control course and a licensing exam he also made me feel right at home it was extremely comfortable to work with jeb and the hours flew by he was extremly considerate to his clients and asked what music they wanted to listen to while he did his work i was ok with anything but he put on ladytron score he even gave me a nice discount this was a birthday present to myself jeb also offered touchup for free once everything healedi also learned that jeb likes to do japanese art design with a mystical twist we chatted extensively about his interests and he wants to go to japan to study with a body artist there please check out his artwork clean and fun studio that is professional and at the same time friendly and serious about their work only in brooklyn baby only in brooklyn
just like how spaghetti and meatballs or meatloaf often evokes warm childhood memories for many food here elicits those same sentiments from deep inside me raised by a szechuanese mother my favorite childhood foods were without a doubt mapo tofu doublecooked pork belly with leeks water boiled fish stirfried potatoes with chilis blistered long peppers and spicy braised chicken however it has been over a decade since i last tasted those wonderful creations from my mother as she stopped cooking in the house after the grade although i now do not eat szechuan cuisine on a regular basis my appreciation for this unique regional cooking has not diminished the least bit however i am rather picky about szechuan restaurants i have come across over the years especially in nyc there are many more viable options in los angeles as i cant help but to compare them to those from my cherished childhood recollectionsi must say szechuan gourmet comes pretty close to my mothers cooking in fact i was first introduced to this place years ago when my mom visited the city from back west she insisted we have dinner here out of all the other more prestigious restaurants in the city well if its good enough for her someone born and raised in szechuan then its good enough for mei highly recommend the water boiled sliced fish fillets swimming in a hot pool of chili oil labeled peppers on their menu but it really isnt that spicy the szechuan peppercorns really add a depth of flavor like you wouldnt expect and the tender sole fillets along with napa cabbage and bamboo shoots add some crunch and textural balance the wontons in hot chili oil is very good as well as the sesame paste adds creaminess that helps cool down the heat blistered long peppers mapo tofu stirfried string beans with pork bits doublecooked pork belly and chili leeks hot spicy cold noodles and cumin lamb are great here as welland if you dont like or cant eat very spicy food dont fret even the most timid eaters can appreciate the other truly delicious and milder chinese dishes at this place they have some reliable seafood dishes sesame chicken frog legs and scallion pancakes that taste better than most versions found in chinatowni dont normally review chinese restaurants because my standards for chinese food are almost impossibly high being halfszechuanese my standards for szechuan cuisine are therefore even higher trust me come here for the best szechuan cuisine in nyc
oyster special all day every day how can you not love just the sound of these wordscornelius spots a curved wooden ceiling and exposed brick walls a beautiful long bar covered in mosaic tiles and unobstructed view that is just perfect to watch the sun set in brooklyn while sitting at the barthe offers draft beers with flights priced between two beers and four beers interestingly they also serve a german riesling and a long island merlot on from their cocktail list i tried the cornelius lime honey and sage muddled together with gin a bit too light for my liking but balanced and certainly very refreshing it goes very well with oystersduring a recent visit we were fortunate enough to meet new chef chris caracciolo an enthusiastic guy with a genuine passion for oysters which he gets fresh on a daily basis chris likes to keep the rotating oyster menu at cornelius interesting with unusual picks alongside some classics after sampling a couple of plates of blue we wanted to get a few kumamotos unfortunately they were out of kumamotos that evening but chef caracciolo gave us a few hammersley oysters wa to try for free deepcupped creamywhite plump with a strong sweet flavor and a mineral mild finish i loved themalongside with drinks and oysters we also got the flat bread with pancetta truffled goat cheese and wild mushrooms it is as good and satisfying as it soundsoverall cornelius is a great bar to mingle and relax for its nice welcoming atmosphere no attitude and great oyster happy hour the bar at cornelius gets five well deserved drinks happy hour monday all night and daily a method that prevents oxidation blue points can be a bit of a hitormiss thing but in this case they were nice plump oysters that were surprisingly rich in flavor
red hook is one of the most inconvenient neighborhoods in the city public transportation does little to get you there easily its shoreline makes for a particularly brutal and unbearable winter and even the cast of the real world brooklyn had no clue what to make of this place and yet it is often regarded as some fabled faroff land people will dedicate a full day to explore this mythical shanty town and all of the quirks that come along with it a nearmandatory stop at red hook lobster pound appearing almost always on their agendasi am not one of these peopleno i let the lobsters come to me by way of their fancy food truck big red and this stands to be one of the bigger exceptions to the whole brickandmortar shop vs parkandserve vehicle where the latter may actually prove to be the better of the two based on convenience alone thats right i said iteither way at the center of this whole operation is of course their famous lobster rolls ive had both of their signature sandwiches connecticut and maine and let me tell you choosing between them is like choosing between your own two children between the godfather and the godfather part ii between james bond and jason bourne between blair waldorf and serena van der woodsen between capn crunch and count chocula between jenny mccarthy and carmen electra and of course between edward and jacob i knowas with most things it all comes down to preference if you like your lobster warm and drenched in butter and who doesnt look no further than the connecticut roll this constitution state variety is simple in execution but big on taste thanks in part to the exceptional topsplit bread soaking up all that delicious buttery goodness plus the crustacean chunks they stuff into this bun are nojoke huge however if you like your lobster cold and served with mayo really who doesnt make yours a maine roll the freshness of the lobster is on full display here accompanied by celery garnish and some seriously special spices sprinkled on top and again the bread so heavenly it should hold together every sandwich either way you choose im tellin you you cant go wrongas for the whole food truck experience what helps keep the line down is the price tag effectively warding off all the how do i say this without offending anyone poor people a fullportioned lobster roll is gonna cost you and beyond at any other seafood joint so while it may exceed the daily lunch allowance youve given yourself the money spent is certainly no ripoff its actually very reasonable and while youre at it might as well splurge for their hookup special for three bucks more which adds to your order a bag of cape cod potato chips and maine root soda of your choosing i go mandarin orange and if you happen to be a huge dork discover via their twitter account that the first twenty people to wish big red and company a happy national lobster day on june then go ahead and do just that well you may be handsomely rewarded with a free red hook lobster pound tshirt not that i have the cotton garment to prove it or anything pleaseand in case you were wondering ill narcissistically assume you were my unborn first son part ii bond although bourne would win in a fight whichever one is blake lively capn carmen and edward duh
at forcella your taste buds will very quickly distinguish the flavor of napoli from everything else frankly i dont know which part of napoli they send cooks from olive garden maybe its little napoli somewhere in the back streets of newark maybe its some guy named tony napoli romano who teaches out of his apartment in brooklyn i dont know all i know is that my mouth and taste buds thanked me for treating them to a true authentic taste of napoli which i got here at forcella they also slapped me around a bit and said max you are our owner and we love you but dont ever go against the palette and take us to olive garden ever i came here for lunch and was lucky to get a taste of the brunch menu as well i started with the amalfi salad made up of radicchio arugula gorgonzola pear and nuts served over olive oil directly imported from napoli this was a symphony in my mouth with every ingredient playing a distinct part from the crispiness of the pear to the freshness of the radicchio following that up with some antipasti i initially was going to go with the prosciutto mozzarella but wanted to try something original since you can get that dish at any italian restaurant so i ordered the caponatina instead the eggplant zucchini potato red pepper and tomato was perfectly grilled even though it was delicious it was also very light because l gotta be honest i did worry that i was not going have room for the main course for the main course i was craving a red pizza but heard rave reviews about the pizza carbonara so decided to get both and have leftovers for the next day for the white pizza i ended up with the pizza carbonara from the brunch menu i am pretty sure giulio the chef and the genius behind this shindig is the only one that bakes his pizzas with ice i was curious so i kindly asked him wtf what kind of flavor is he adding with ice if i wanted soggy pizza id call pizza hut it turns out that the temperature in the oven which is also imported from napoli is degrees in order for you not too burn the egg and dough and keep the temperature consistent you put the ice in when it came out it was the best damn tasting bread i usually leave the crust when i eat pizza but here i ate the whole entire thing with the tasty prosciutto on top i got my meat fix my red pizza followed you can judge a good pizza shop by ordering their most basic pizza which is the pizza marguerite this way they cant disguise the base and foundation of the pizza the cheese bread and tomato sauce with a crapload of toppings when it came out even though i completely scarfed down my pizza carbonara i had to have a slice of this the taste matched up to its aroma and actually brought me back to italy holy shitaly this was good i had to stop at the slice because dessert was coming but took it back with me across manhattan and on a bus back to jersey the smell was so fresh and potent that i thought i was gonna get shanked and get my pizza taken away i was gonna put a fight for this pizzafor dessert i ended up getting the wheat pastry with cheese when it comes out it looks like its going to be one of those weight watchers desserts without flavor thats what you tell your friends so that you dont have to share scarf this down while you enjoy the moist sweet taste of the cheese stabbing anyone that comes close to it with your other hand this pastry needs nothing else no nutella no cream the cheese is so damn good that id choose this dessert over any other any day cant wait for this place to open up in manhattan
whoah the bakers here are no joke whether the specific offerings are to your liking or not is a personal preference but i think anyone who has done any baking or patisserie can appreciate the level of skill that it takes to perfect these goods their croissants are astounding the layers of the dough are buttery and pronounced crisp on the outside with some bite to the interior layers they melt on the tongue its a sublime experience which id almost given up on in the city i say that i dont care for croissants but its a lie i dont care for the middling offerings of most bakeries these would be enough to turn me into a croissant lover if i hadnt been lying about disliking them the almond chocolate variation is perfect there is plenty of sweet almond paste but not enough to make the pastry cloying and the chocolate is rich and used in moderation so that it doesnt overwhelm the almond or the buttery dough every bite feels like one is ingesting the years of training that it took to perfect this product the almondine baguette differs from the classic french baguette with the addition of whole wheat flour each translucent glutenous crag is speckled with almond colored wheat germ from the whole flour the crust is chewy i prefer the crispy crust that i get from baking my own baguettes getting them fresh out of the oven although my interiors are quite good the texture doesnt compare to the delicate interior texture of almondines baguette the macaron shells are a little chewier than i like i prefer the slightly drier ones at madeleines on but the moistness of these shells does tend to convey flavor better than a dry macaron like the toocrumbly offerings at financiers the flavors are limited but classic and that seems to be a standard at almondine they arent trying to be everything to everyone but they are clearly aiming for perfection in everything that they choose to do

whew i feel like i hit the jackpot when i found this place loved it delicious satisfying sandwhiches but apparently theyre known for their potatoes eggs and mozarella ill try that next time great combo of flavors to choose from all wrapped up in a tasty mealive passed by this place many times but have never gone in except today i made a special trip to the corner of and to see why the door on this place always seems to have people coming and going from beginning to end this place made me happy and i dont know what took me so long to go intheres a huge variety of hot sandwhiches heros and salads to choose from some common ingredients included things like fried eggplant mozarella and meatballs i couldnt figure out which flavors would make my tastebuds happiest so i watched the people behind the counter make a few sandwhiches i could hear people saying things like ah i hate having to choose just one thing here and omg ive never eaten a whole sandwhich of anything before this place is great amused by how frequent and excited these people were of ordering and how proud the people behind the counter looked making food i decided what i wanted the guy behind the counter must have seen me standing there for too long because he gave me a friendly smile and asked me what i wanted i got the vinnie something sweet sausages and peppers yum it was great too much to eat in one sitting but when i left after eating my sandwhich feeling completely satisfied and like i had just had a new york experience now ive gotta check out the one in brooklyn hope you get a chance to check out this place too it will make your stomach happy
tortas nezas recently opened a location on the southwest corner of roosevelt and st in woodside they have another location in corona which i have not been to the immediate area does not seem to be great for keeping mexican places afloat but i truly hope these guys make it for a while i think they could be in the top tier of the taco totem pole of western queens please do your part to keep this place alive for my sakeyou cant go wrong when you get the basics down the tortillas are robust and well griddled the meats are properly executed the braised lengua while slightly salty comes as large chunks of beefy tenderness the carnitas is moist and porksome with adequately dessicated and crisp edges the suadera has nicely singed edges yielding to juicy meat and fat the bistec has the clean flavor of beef and is so perfectly cooked that its almost boring yes it would be better if it were grilled over live fire instead of seared on the griddle but really im not complaining if youre worthy enough to be given a bit of the fresh made tomatillo salsa you should be grateful and if you wonder aloud about whether they have roasted chiles and onions you might find yourself lucky enough to have some prepared for you on the spot needless to say the two cooks are friendly and accommodating in the tight space and quite skilled at the art of the antojito any doubts you have should vanish when you see the milanesa de pollo a perfectly deepfried slab of flesh crunchy golden brown outside succulent inside too bad it only comes on a torta or a cemita every respectable meat should come in a taco i think the cemita is respectable authenticated by the use of papalo emboldened by the chipotles en adobo assuaged by the stringy quesillo but isnt it the bread that always lets you down a bit on the dry side a tad too thick taking away the balance from the rest alas next time i will ask them to put it in two tacos instead and hope that they obligethere are tortas galore which is their real specialty but ill let you explore them for yourself offerings in addition to cemitas and quesadillas sometimes they have al pastor though not on a spit and you can even get your oreja ontortas roosevelt avewoodside midnightfree delivery sometimes
the modern high end feel of this store reminds me a little of being at pierre hermes in paris which is already a plus as others have mentioned the macarons here are slightly bigger than normal which to me just means each macaron has two bites of deliciousness rather than one macaron snobs will tell you the most important difficult thing about making a macaron is the shell the texture should be perfect almondy and moist slightly chewy without being cloying each shell should contain a foot and if the foot doesnt exist its not a properly made macaron bisous comes pretty damn close to perfection with their shellsthe fillings while all tasty were a smidge overabundant in amount but it didnt detract from the lovely experience i had from eating all that i bought standouts salted caramel rose pistachiogreat raspberry lavender honey gianduja needs slightly more hazelnut but still very tastythe pacakging and bag are sleek and sexy as well in case you ever need to buy a last minute present or just so when you treat yourself you will be delighted when you open them
this is the first establishment that got me thinking about ice cubesid never really thought about ice cubes before i knew them to be cold i knew that their time on earth was limited especially if im drinking but i never really thought about the diversity of ice cubes we enjoyed at least in new york city i certainly cant speak for your village or rebelheld provincethe ice cube in my drink was the largest ice cube id even seen it was like a rubiks cube floating in gin it was perfect in all ways smooth crystal clear square it was like a supermodel as far as ice cubes go and i miss her very much yes i assign ice cubes genderi think about that ice cube and the brief time we spent together a lot probably too much im a simple man who can be won over by frozen water

i love french fries i give it up for lent every year and every year it gets harder im sorry to the hardcore catholics out there that are rolling their eyes at this seemingly lame sacrifice for days but really it was hard especially since i happened to walk by this place many times this season and had to restrain myself from breaking down and ordering a batch and im not one of those that takes breaks on sundaysso finally after a long wait i came by here to indulge and break my fast man it was worth the wait i got a large cone to share with a friend and seriously it was life changing im generally a ketchup or ranch person with fries sometimes even a garlic mayo or ketchupmayo person or when the craving hits ill even do filipino banana ketchup but holy crap sauces like pomegranate teriyaki war sauce roasted garlic mango chutney etc had me spinning like all of my lifes knowledge of french fries was suddenly turned upside down who would dare disturb the universe that is ketchup and friesthis place was amazing i loved every tiny bit of my cone of happiness to the very last salty crumb all the sauces with it and the many many samples of the other sauces i even liked the mix of mango chutney with roasted garlic it all just worked after talking with the fry guys they offered me a sample of their new recipe sauce which he aptly named omg no joke it probably is the more accurately named sauce since those are the only words that could describe the mix of flavors its not on the menu but it damn well should be maybe next year ill have to just give up pomme frites for lent since staying away from this wonderful place will be hard enough
behind closed doors and a level below the rest of the world is a dark underground lair where the outcasts of the world retreat to unwind this is by no means a speakeasy yet the urgency to keep things hidden seems to exist here still in this subterranean playground leave the platform heels sequined halter tops and popped collars at home as dress codes have no place here the booth seats open up revealing storage for those winter coats and for those womenmen who still carry their entire lives in their purses free up your arms because when you hear your favorite tunes come on youll be throwing your hands in the air and waving them up like you just dont give a fuck here the trendy bacon is not subtly added to your plate but instead is the star of an appetizer dish with maple syrup offered to dip these crispy fatty bits the audacity some may exclaim but in actuality its pure genius in a part of town that prides itself on hip food a big fuck you comes in a paper bag the under appreciated tator tots sits in the bag and is quickly tore open and ravaged once it hits the table the rest of the menu while not innovative in any way are deliciously executed sports bar favorites that do a worthy job of soaking up that booze whiskey brooklyn makes drunken shenanigans easy with affordable drink prices spicy picklebacks beer back deals and a whiskey selection that will have you spending at least a few nights here to taste them all ask for some selections not listed on the menu beer makes you pee like a race horse no problem as there are ample bathroom stalls to help you unload need to destress a stripper pole shuffleboard video games and whatever else your twisted mind desires are also here for you to exert that pent up energy returning here time and time again to forget the ills of the outside world is easy its a retreat where i hide and where i play and every visit here has resulted in disaster jubilated delicious ithurtsthenextmorning disaster but seriously who gives a fuck
wow thank you so much fellow yelpers you did not steer me wrong here i took my little blondie in for a bath and boy did she ever need one she finally had all of her puppy shots and the coast was clear to bring her in for her first ever trip to the groomers i am so glad i chose this placeit took a bit of time for her to be finished but i think that is because they have great work ethic here and im glad that i had the extra time because bark slope salon is in a great area with lots of fun shops to entertain myself with while i waitedwhen i picked her up i couldnt even believe she was the same dog that i dropped off my jaw literally dropped and no offense to her because shes an absolutely beautiful maltese but i have never seen her look so good she smells fantastic and is soft and fluffy as can be that is because they use top of the line shampoos and conditioners here they will even brush your dogs teeth or scale them if you pay a little extrashe now looks like she could become a show dog and maybe they will even cast her in the cesars dog food commercials as cesar himselfs love interest someday haha liked it so much that i made an ongoing weekly appointment bring your dog here and be prepared to be wowed too
i am definitely an s woman hear me roar insert cheers and gaspssheila kelleys s factor is the original creator of the oh so sinfully seductive pole dance workout that has been taking the nation by storm over the past few years i had heard about this movement from one of my friends at ucla and she highly recommended it as being one of the best and appealing workouts shes ever done when i moved to nyc i needed something to jump start my exercise routine to curb weight gain and decided pole dancing might be just the thing i was a little worried about it though since i did have an acl repair in high school but i was assured that my knee would be fine with the movements they were right i signed up for an intro class last october and ive been indulging in my erotic creature ever since i look forward to my hour class every single week and that my friends is something you need in order to work out it has to appeal to you and you must truly want to go otherwise youll drop the routine and just sit home and do nothing doing s factor also got me into signing up for a gym so now i am working out at least times a week which is what i needed in my new postcollege life you can also sign up for smaller shorter classes if you want more workouts on the side as you take more levels or specialty classes you are rewarded points that you can then use to redeem for other classes thats a great little reward for someone like me who has been taking the classes for a long period of timepole dancing has certainly changed my body and made me stronger and more powerful you should see some of the things i can do now i can defy gravity haha people often write off pole dancing as a sexual stripper only type of act but really strippers can not do what my teachers can do they are true athletes that compare to the athletic abilities of cirque du soleil they are such beautiful and strong women pole dancing is not about dancing for a man or even a woman its about dancing for yourself it gives you such confidence in your own sexy self and the womanonly environment is very warm and friendly ive made some wonderful friends here and i look forward to another year as an s woman my s factors new years resolution is to be able to do the splits and meet the lovely sheila kelley i love s factorps s factor is not cheap but if you have a financial situation you can apply for scholarships or even partake in a work study to make it more than affordable if you ever want to take a halfoff intro class just pm me and i can email you the offer all current students have a referral program disclaimer though do not blame me if you become addicted to the movement but you can thank me later pss as a fun note in my first week class level one i had kyra sedgwick as my partner how cool is that she was so sweet and great on the pole

im a superfreak for super wings trinis are definitely representing here with their take on hot wings fantastically seasoned magically delicious and downright devilish wings i went with the trini tamarind wings which is what bobby flay lost to in the throwdown with bobby flay episode i was in west indian paradise when i bit into theseserved with your choice of two sides i got the corn salad and the potato wedges along with an ice cold lemonginger and pineapple juice i could not have asked for a more delightful meal i am so happy to see a good quality restaurant doing so well in this neighborhood and for them to keep their prices so low for such a highquality product is outstanding i predict they will expand at some pointthe only downfall to this cute joint is that they arent quite a restaurant because there is not really any seating that probably cuts down on costs as they dont have table service and need to pay for a waitstaff but its fine the way it is fyi they are really active on their facebook page i even got a shot out on there a few times and they have also wrote messages on my personal page way to work the social networking game that just makes me want to keep coming back and send business their way they also have trivia on there and give away free food and tshirts to whoever answers the question correctly first hands down this place has the best chicken wings i have ever had i dont think anyone would be disappointed if you like wings they have a variety of flavors to satisfy anyones taste buds go here now
i was blessed with a thick head of hair unfortunately said hair is extremely disobedient and resistant to styling the most annoying thing is that its neither perfectly straight nor voluminously wavy which means if i just leave it after showering which i usually do because im really lazy about my hair its just a big pile of blah it was this laziness that prompted my decision to look into japanese hair straightening jhs i figured that the jhs would save me the time and trouble of styling and would also flatten my hair so that it wouldnt need to be thinned out every time i got a haircut i found jjs hair salon through angelina k who had followed her hair stylist melissa from cinderella hair castle to jjs according to angelina the quality of the perm has more to do with the stylist than the salon and since the the proof of her credibility is in her own perfectly straightened hair i decided to trust her and make an appointment with melissajjs is koreanrun but the stylists that worked on me spoke enough english that i didnt have any problems communicating with them the salon is large and clean with typical trendy asian salon decor i appreciated the lockers they have in the back for you to put your belongings the locker key is given to you on a stretchy wristband bracelet spastyle after the shampoo and headneck massage that is customary with asian hair salons melissa asked me a couple of questions about my hair how often i blow dry and straighten it whether or not its colored etc and answered the questions i had on the process before getting started i decided to get a brazilian keratin treatment bkt in addition to the jhs while the jhs would thermally recondition my hair leaving it pinstraight the bkt would hydrate my hair and counter the damage from the jhs leaving my hair smooth soft and shiny i wont bore you with the details but five hours later i had shiny perfectly pinstraight hair i admit that i had a nagging fear that my hair would go back to its messy form after washing it especially since i know how stubborn my hair can be but after waiting the obligatory two days after a perm to wash my hair it was still as straight as it was when i left the salon days ago whew i can now vouch for melissas skill too i plan on continuing to go to my trusted stylist at subimage for haircuts but melissas my girl when it comes to straightening treatmentsthanks girl i got the standard bkt for but if you want the highest quality keratin it runs for any hair length
im still full over hours after having dinner at gravy i was still happily stuffed and dreaming about scallops and grits what better day to have southern comfort food than the first real scorcher of the season the food was fresh and delicious with generous portions service was very prompt but maybe a tad too eager which is way better than a tad too anything else i really like the decor here it was cheerful and bright a little retro comfortable and spacious it pretty much looks how i would want my house to look but with beds and showers and my house would definitely have the same bar gorgeous the culinary nitty gritty cocktails the sazerack delicious but a little on the sweet side for me the hurricane pretty much the best hurricane ive tasted though ive only ever had them at one other place legendsfood raw oysters blue points served with two different kinds of sauces the first one was a refreshing minty sauce that im sure was refreshing but i dont love mint sothe pineapple salsa on the other hand was to die for spicy smokey sweet and tangy muah so great the salsa kinda stole the show but the the oysters were pretty dang good too a good size and nice and briny grits threeways cheesy porky and honey get this dish i thought i had grits coming out of my ears and we were only able to eat about of the order my favorite was the honey and not porky despite the bacon shocking i know because they were so smooth and creamy and sweet and heavenly and and anddies sullivan island bog dirty things are good dirty words dirty martinis dirty jokes dirty looks ok maybe not that one unless youre giving them this dish had dirty rice and it was pretty darn good scallop shrimp head on and okra were the best parts for me a bit al dente for me but im asian and prefer my rice mushy and sticky grouper only had a couple bites of this dish but it was pretty good i thought it was a little sad that no spoon was provided for the yummy broth though pecan pie a la mode plenty of pecans and not disgustingly sweet as some pies of this variety can be sometimes the whipped cream was kinda foamy and im not sure if it was intentional or not by the time we left i was almost positive grits were spilling out of my ears and felt ready to walk to brooklyn and back sometimes you just cant help yourselfand sometimes you shouldntyay review
this is one of the best sushi places i have eaten at in nyc so fari had to take care of some things in midtown and decided to stay in the area for dinner a friend of mine let me be in charge of picking out a good sushi spot i turned to yelp on my iphone it showed a lot of places but this one had the best reviews and the photos were very enticingthey didnt lie i made reservations and we were set for the night upon walking in you are greeted in a nicely decorated receiving area theres complimentary mms for you to nibble on by the doori like how the guy calls the host upstairs and lets them know that im here i wasnt sure if the sushi bar would be full so my reservations were for a table while i wait they were setting up the table i get the green light and make my way up i am shown my table and immediately given a hot towel to freshen up now thats servicei skim through the menu and look around remembering from yelp i already knew what i wanted the box of dreams and the sashimi platter my friend came and we decided to eat at the bar they set up a new spot for us and we were good to go seeing how sushi is made is like seeing an artist paint a mural its an art form that takes a lot of skillwe sat in the front where the head chef was he was really cool and recommended we get some oysters we ordered the box of dreams and the platter seeing him slice and arrange the sashimi in precision and perfection was amazing he put a lot of detail into each piecethe oysters came and were phenomenal they came in pieces on a bed of assorted seaweed on shaved ice presentation was excellent the flavors were amazing and a good mix the oysters had a touch of ponzu green onion and some heat after a squeeze of lemon it was in and down the hatch one of the best oysters ive had in nycthe box of dreams really looked like a dream its boxes with bowls of white rice in each one each box had something different to offer toro uni ikura ebi it was a real feast for the eyes im a big fan of uni and ikura i asked the chef if he can make me something that wasnt on the menu and he graciously said yes we are now bffs he made a special uni ikura rolls for me the perfect match with a hint of wasabi you will not find wasabi paste here but the real thingthe sashimi platter came and it looked too good enough to eat after taking pics it was tasting time there was an assortment of tuna accompanied by salmon toro mackerel red snapper and scallops the ones that stood out were the scallops and toro they were really fresh and tasted good on its own no soy needed the mackerel included the bones as a garnish and they deep fry it after your meal with a shaving of rock salt im not sure if they do that for everyone cause i didnt see it in any of the reviews awesome this acted like a palette cleanser which made us ready for dessertto finish off our meal we ordered some mochi and melon the mochi arrived in flavors mango green tea and strawberry you can never go wrong with mochi it was arranged so perfectly and tasted very good the melon was carefully cut and arranged in a very nice pattern it was sweet and a great way to end a great mealif you couldnt tell already by this review my dinner was awesome i had no complaints whatsoever with the food the staff is amazing and the head chef is awesome
gushine guxiang has become my favorite taiwanese restaurant in the five boroughs eating here brings me back to my visits to taiwan where i had a little bit of everything from street food to home cooked meals every time i use chinese car service this place gets mentioned almost every time as a must eat in flushing and now their popularity is reaching epic levels with lines out of the door during dinner on weekends along with accolades from various local publications my hope is the popularity hasnt gone to their heads as i notice the prices are slowly rising each time i come out here their infamous two entrees one soup deal has gone from to in less than two years the owner and the staff though friendly and hospitable are becoming more stern to deal with the crowds being a longtime customer has its perks since im luckily in the good graces of the staff whenever they see meeven at for two entrees and a soup the deal is solid portion sizes here are decent and the food is always very tasty favorites here include sacha niurou sacha beef xia chao dan shrimp scrambled eggs chou doufu stinky tofu ooachian taiwanese oyster pancake sanbei ji three cup chicken and paigu fan porkchop over rice i also have had favorable results with their hongshao tofu spicy tofu mapo tofu and shengjian bao pan fried buns just typing all of these dishes already has me hungrythose not wanting the popular entree soup deal would be smart to order the small plates xiao chi that would include some of the food mentioned above such as the oyster pancake or classic staple pork chop over rice each were about last time i checked and both are outstandingbeyond the price gripe my only other issue is they often close too early they wont take people in after at times because theyll want to close sometime between i can only imagine how great this place would be as a late night spot my taste buds along with many others in the area would never be more thankful
this place is seriously famous in my neighborhood there have been so many times where im walking home or just walking around and people stop and ask hey do you know where that really good icy place is its called louies or something i just point them the right direction and tell them to enjoy because i sure do my family is also in love with this place and they just count the days when louie gs opens shop for the summer its probably dangerous that its blocks from where i live our trash can is always filled with empty blue and white louie cups special bonus if you follow them on twitter they always post secret words or questions that when you go to louie gs and say the secret word or answer you win a free icy score as you can see from my super cheesy twitter pic on the yelp page i won on memorial day so i got a free huge icy the staff is ridiculously friendly the owner andre is usually there and talks it up with his customers not exaggerating ive never seen such a friendly staff and thats shocking considering the line to the window of this place is usually super long in times like these youd expect the staff to become overwhelmed and frustrated but these people keep their cool and still make time to joke around and help the customers choose the flavor of choice this place also has a lot of flavor choices i know when i won my free icy they asked what flavors i wanted i glanced over the chart and thought oh crap theres billions of flavors i didnt think this through i knew i had to hurry up since a fire truck pulled up with hungry and yummy ha firemen ready to tear up some icy deliciousness the girl at the window was very very helpful asked me what flavors i liked choco vanilla fruity etc and she perfected my icy after i said words peanut butter and banana she turned around and picked fantastic flavors this is really my new fave place oh and seriously follow them on twitter free ices
in the landscape of supreme pizzerias paulie gees is a gamechanger i want to shout it on a mountaintop or like madonna in her express yourself music video get on top of a giant statue and declaredont go for second best babyput your love of pizza to the testyou know you know youve got tomake that trip to greenpoint ave and maybe then youll know your love is realim honestly confounded as to how the same formula of pizzamaking is applied here dough cheese sauce toppings but the results are mystically different a paulie gees pizza is an ethereal indescribable product of goodness its fior di latte cheese is dreamy and creamy its crust tender and bubbly the consistency like that of delicious naan bread and the whole of the pie soft and crisp flavorful with all the combinations via its exotic and forwardreaching menu but understated wellbalanced and even delicate it is like eating art last night was a special night and the boyfriend and i went to pgs for our fix since it has been quite a few months since our last visit on this rainy evening in brooklyn the crowd swelled inside this dimly lit rustic and casual pizzeria delightfully we did not have to wait for a table and were seated immediately i love their use of salvaged wood and the attention to detail from the rustic ceiling to the back end of the restaurant where you will see heavens gate i mean the napolibranded oven where they churn out their amazing pizza pies after a walk through the menu we decided on two pies the mootz fior di latte chopped fresh garlic pecorino romano olive oil fresh basil and sea salt with added sweet italian fennel sausage and the cherry jones fior di latte gorgonzola cheese prosciutto di parma dried bing cherries and orange blossom honey i thought it was pure genius to temper the sweetness of the bing cherries with the prosciutto in order to prevent it from tasting like dessert the saltiness of the ham added a muchappreciated level of savory to an already outstanding pie as for the mootz i loved how the fresh leaves of basil which were nicely tucked and melted into the cheese had truly brought life to this pizza the herbiness of the fragrant basil married perfectly with the generous chunks of fennel sausage i noticed at the end of the meal the soot rather the remnants of charred crust that colored and blackened my fingers was an all too precious indication of my glorious time eating great pizza we also had dessert which was fantastic two scoops of pistachio ice cream im assuming van leeuwen with a sweet and crunchy brittle incredible not one missed note paulie i have been here on three separate occasions and each time paulie gees outdoes itself my pizza somehow gets better and better my love for this place blossoms to new heights i know that theres a little place called difaras which is discussed with cultlike fervor amongst pizza connoisseurs but paulie gees is much more my speed and i have been to both places the pizza is more refined it is elevated pizza also it is not as pricey and the atmosphere is much more ideal but to each their own i will continue to cultivate my obsession with pgs and not be the least bit shy about it i adore paulie gees absolutely completely and utterly phenomenal i just i cant even
red rooster is one of the hottest restaurants in town a reservation weeks in advance will still have you eating after and even then you may get bumped by a celebrity patron in our case it was questlove in all honesty these are not the kind of places that i am inclined to like very much but this place offers up amazing food at a really affordable price so like every mere mortal i anxiously await my turn in the very long line to eat here it really is worth the effort the restaurant is small and the space is nearly evenly divided between the animated bar up front and a choice collection of tables some communal in the rear all set before an open view kitchen the bar doesnt require reservations so it is considerably more crowded the clientele are generally wellheeled smartly dressed and squarely middleaged the bartenders mix up an intriguing list of cocktails that are delicious and worthy of attention the eponymous big red rooster was surprisingly smooth and astoundingly good who can error with cinnamoninfused bourbon add to that dolin rouge averna amaro and orange bitters and you have an instant classic eventually we were called to our seats and had a gander at the menu it is notably short but the selections are strong we decided to begin with appetizers the oysters with ginger mignonette and the corn tacos and tostadas the oysters were fresh and delicious interestingly enough they were served with a surprise vodka shooter which i have not encountered before better yet were the tacos and tostadas they are quite small and easily managed with a mere two bites apiece but what amazing bites the yellowtail and salmon contained within were very fresh its strange the preparations were conventional but the taste was anything but that is what is great about a skilled chef able to make the most of every bite great texture and flavors throughout leaving you wanting more for the main course i had the blackened catfish this was an exceptionally well crafted dish that was engaging on several levels and looked beautiful the catfish had great color and texture and was well seasoned in such a way as to enhance the dish without obfuscation or dominance it rested on a bed of black eyed peas that were mixed with celery root great idea another surprise the use of fried pickles i loved the delicate walk between comfort food and fine dining exemplified in this dish the flavors harmonized and it was simply a joy to eat clearly with this runup dessert could not be missed so we decided to share the black and white mud even this was amazing chocolate cookie crust chocolate fudge vanilla fudge coming together to make for a rather rich dessert that much would have made it good and perhaps forgettable garnish it with coarse sea salt and candied ginger and it becomes wondrous honestly my first bite registered a sweet rich dessert then there was a second wave with the salt coming through and then two seconds later that wow moment when my mind registered the dish as a whole oh my goodness this is really quite good how do you top an amazing meal with amazing cocktails well marcus samuelsson himself came over and shook my hand and posed for a photo with my girlfriend we also saw him actively working in the kitchen which is a rarity for known chefs these days as good as it gets folks reserve a table at your earliest opportunity strongly recommend
the realization that i would be awarding five yelp stars to a thai restaurant hit me before the arrival of the lychee sorbet theres a special chapter of my personal philosophy devoted to thai chiefly that every thai resto in the city shares a kitchen and that thai food is best enjoyed from takeout boxes in the comfort of your own living room in short not a destination foodkin shop though is a destination and i recommend you make it your next the location on sixth avenue sandwiched between bodegas and chain delis is odd particularly in contrast to its classyhip interior a beautiful bar openair kitchen and cheerful decorthe food really carried the experience here was an instance where my positive memories of the service and ambiance were rendered irrelevant by the sheer and inarguable deliciousness of warm sugarsnaps and scallops specked with toasted coconut and sesame and marinating in coconut cream sauce a savory and spicy masala tomato soup and rice noodles with rock shrimp that didnt taste anything like the wondee siams in a good way tables are meant to accommodate parties of the vibe is a bit cafe for a proper date but im excited to return with friends to sample the enticing cocktail list as well as the remaining menu items if kin shop is thai food then i rescind my position of skepticism about the canon thai food is awesome

whoa a luchadorethemed mexican restaurant its like god or i guess a smaller masked more acrobatic mexican god made this just for me as if mexican god said to me galvin how would you like to eat delicious tacos in an establishment dedicated to the mexican version of the hilarious carnival of sadness that is pro wrestling which like most foreign versions of stuff thats already pretty crazy makes it totally batshitinsane crazy and i was like thanks mexican god you are now the best god and i appreciate your creating la lucha nyc from the raw essence of dreams i never dared to have and i will go there right awaynow even if you do not for whatever odd reason hold a similar weird morbid fascination for the spectacle of large sweaty dudes taking turns dominating each other while basically nakedlets not dwell too much on my own interestthere is no need to be put off or intimidated by this place believe it or not the theme and decor here are relatively restrained and dare i say tasteful sure theres masks and weird shrines on the wall but little of it at eye level and its not as if your server parades to your table with theme music or delivers all orders from the top rope this isnt that kinda kitschy gimmicky place no this is a mexican wrestaurant see what i did there with class as for the food well i may not have grown up in california and every fifth phrase out of my mouth isnt fish taco so i may not know from authenticity but brother these are some delicious tacos after some delectable vegetarian read good but can only be so good appetizers i opted for super porky carnitasas i knew i would from the moment i saw it on the menu because i mean its called super porkywhile my friend picked dr wagner the mayanstyle pork taco of course all the food is named after mexican wrestling stars as for the canonical reasoning behind an ostensibly german doctor becoming a mexican wrestler who then later had a mayan taco named after him in new york your guess is as good as mine super porky did not disappoint but food envy struck the instant my friend got his mouth around dr wagner this review finally gay enough and immediately proclaimed it one of the most awesome things hed ever eaten now we probably couldve stopped there and been contentthe tacos though not huge are definitely satisfyingbut we enjoyed our food so much that i ignored my usual tightwadsmallportions leanings and called the waitress back over to order some moreat a taco i can understand complaints that the food here is overpriced but well we got a filling superdelicious meal for each with tax and tip included which doesnt seem totally atypical of nyc pricing to me also our bill came in a miniature wrestling ring complete with luchadore action figure and because my friend and i are mentally years old we enjoyed making our little toy look like he was fighting with the wad of bills we used to pay and well if you want to slap a price on that be my guest but me and my friend will be over here with our correct priorities and our delicious tacos and our happiness and our fun little toy that we really wanted to steal but did notalso of note is the owners presence right here on his restaurants review page on yelp owner participation just doesnt happen enough on this site and whenever franklin m comments on reviews of his business here he always seems first and foremost genuinely appreciative of the patronage and secondly honest and gently informative when reviewers say something that is just plain offbase the temptation to be a total dick when white people start telling you how your hometown ethnic cuisine is supposed to be must be just offthecharts enraging and i am just as impressed by franklins restraint as i am by his ideas for restaurantsso yeah la lucha nyc is my new favorite mexican place and would be even without the great theme true its not like there are absolutely no complaints to be leveled against the place such as the lack of liquor license which i believe theyre working on but they should hurry up because beer and tacos are simply two things that should happen together and of course the whole endeavor would really be a lot more authentic if every six months or so one of the menu items died at a young age of drugrelated causes but hey one place cant have everything ive ever dreamed of
sometimes all you need is a good friend a glass or two of wine and some olives and then the world seems so much more tolerableive been to gg on several occasions and it has always been a solid choice their appetizers get the olive bowl trust me and small entrees never fail i would highly recommend either the artichoke tomato and arugula or the portobello and roasted red pepper pizzas ive also heard good things about the meatball and caramelized onion and the artichoke and shaved romano pizzas but the most important thing is the wine if youre unsure about a wine on the menu mattwho is very well versedwill help you figure out what it is you would like to drink his lively and down to earth wine descriptions are perfectgg has zero pretension and the place instantly makes one feel comfortable the music is never loud and always an excellent rotation last night we got to relive high school with new order gang of four the pretenders the cars etcgg is always my prescription for a grey rainy day or any day for that matter now if only i could get my insurance to cover it

i think he was trying to fan us in order to keep us cool in this heati said that with a straight face but srini found it hilarious in all honesty it was extremely distracting to see the server look right and then left moving his neck like a rotating fan while reciting the specials of the day he did his best not to maintain eye contact and i wondered whether it was due to a joke i might have cracked earlierwhy do you love italy so much inquired a friend of me in an earlier visit whats not to love the history the arts the food the people i mean just visualize the map of europe and their neighboring countries and then consider the italians complete lack of organization and structure they dont form a line they cut into lanes they are late for appointments many believe death should precede taxes they believe rules are optional they are vocal and gesture a lot there is an unfocused buzz of electrical energy all around its as if one had transplanted india into europethis was confirmed almost immediately as i asked the server for his recommendation in dessert as i debated with him between the ricotta cheesecake that he named and the chocolate cake he became speechless with emotion such was his conviction and passion that no words came out from his open mouth till ultimately he shook his head and said the best i dont know what was more priceless his reaction or the stunned look of my dining partner as she witnessed his raw earnest emotionthe best truly the best ricotta cheesecake in the city airy creamy the best ive had in my life incomparable even better than a superlative version at venieros as i thanked jim u for his excellent review that drew my attention to pepolinopepolino gets that reaction from many diners srini thought the ribollita tuscan bread soup was the best he had eaten my earlier dining companions have had similar sentiment for the spinach souffle with tomato coulis and parmesan the veal ricotta meatballs the penne with pumpkin fresh ricotta etc that said not all dishes deliver a rapturous feeling with many doubts over the pasta dishes personally ive loved the simple pappardelle with tomato sauce and thyme and the spinach and ricotta gnocchi it would be safe to take a bet on anything with ricottafor a secret restaurant pepolino attracts its fair share of celebs and even i have seen a few in my four visits here however the lingering memory of your visit will be of hearty laughter animated conversation and the sight of arms flailing wide as the italian clientele appreciates the simple pleasures in the minutiae of life reminding you of how everyday life could and should be
its been years years ive been desperate for a proper burger in the bay ridge area of brooklyn i understand that theres a sea of diners and other worldly restaurants out here but none of them has ever served me a decent burger soggy buns gritty patties unmelted cheese ive had it alli was searching for a place to eat with a closeminded friend of mine burgers i thought who in their right mind vegetarians including could turn down a decent burger thats when i discover burger bistro stars on yelp you say in bay ridge for burgers the closest thing to a decent burger here was the overpriced five guys and their burgers are garbage i had my doubtslet me start with my first impressions the dining area itself is small and admittedly lacks personality not much decor is on the walls aside from a few artsycutesy scribbles and not many patrons were on hand either but whatever it was an early afternoon many people were just getting off work at this time we were sat quickly by a very pleasant waitress and proceeded to order now the way you order is a tad odd but ingenious in a way where it frees up a waitresss workload the menu is basically a check list you have a choice of appetizers and from there you can select the way you want your burger done what toppings what kind of bun etc a pastel type pen is provided for you to check off your choices on the menu my friend and i both chose a beef burger with bacon and a jalape√±omayo sauce i had my burger with smoked gouda and he had his with asiago minutes later the burgers arrive and the rest was history super juicy patty equally soft bun this was a quality burger my friend the jalape√±omayo sauce was seriously lacking kick but never mind that this burger deserves the full five stars based on the burger basics alone it is a technical marvel ive had many great burgers in manhattan but burger bistro can compete with just about any of them just because youre residing in bay ridge no longer means that you cant get a good burger well i can say that now anywayadditional noteseven with the bacon and the burger only came out to that is a steal

this is a story of how everything happens for a reason it was a rainy friday night and our other restaurant plans were thwarted by someone reserving the entire place so the bf and i turned to yelp a quick look led us to this spot with a completely unprepossessing name and store front the prices looked about average for indian so we headed in as soon as we were seated i asked the waiter to put in an order of veggie samosas for us we were starving by that point and then we started to browse the ample menu the samosas came out quickly and were delicious perfectly crispy after getting a couple of bites of food in our stomachs we seemingly suddenly noticed that the decor was great meant to evoke the walls of a timeworn street coupled with the warm low lighting it really works encouraged by the tastiness of the samosas we ordered a bunch a mango lassi an order of garlic naan chicken korma for me and tikka masala for the bf after we ordered and polished off the last bit of samosas they brought out a complimentary basket of thin crispy bread likely usually a prelude to appetizers but i appreciate that they obliged our hunger and brought out the samosas right away along with this free treat the waiter brought out my mango lassi and you know what it was the most delicious mango lassi ever perfectly smooth a bit creamy and with just the right amount of cardomom it was right around this point that my bf and i started saying i really like this place we were ready to say the big l word from the apps and lassi alone but we were deliberately trying to temper our language worried that the entrees might not be as amazing fortunately that concern was unfounded both of our curries were flavorful and wellportioned we both had leftovers the naan was nicely fluffy and garlicky and as soon as we finished the first lassi we ordered another and the l word started slipping out the prompt and friendly service was the proverbial icing on the cake and a glance at the check only made up happier all that food including the second lassi was we were stuffed and happy and though it seemed like we were moving fast were were unashamed to declare our feelings we love curry kitchen
date night found us once again headed back to char no the train ride to cobble hill had us regaling the amazing meal we had had the previous time and our hungry stomachs ached to be filled with tasty bourbon and glorious meat productswe were seated at what we now call our table and silence feel not a usual occurrence as i tend to read aloud everything that looks good on the menu as i glanceok stareand comment at every plate that passes in view our mouth watered and smells of great things to come brought smiles to our faces the menu was a little different to reflect the season change since last we had stepped inside the doors at char no but i still wanted to sink my teeth into everything listed on the paper in front of methe boyfriend was quick to ask our pleasant waiter what the specials were both which we jumped on he ordered the lamb loin with white beans and i always being a dainty lady the signature bbq ribs with baked beans and corn breadwe started with the must have appetizers smoked and fried pork nuggets that come with a side of a hot sauce which is the perfect compliment because of its sweet taste and its quick kick of spice we also ordered of course the crispy fried cheddar curds with a side of a spicy pimento sauce which they should bottle and sell id eat it on everythingas we threw appetizers in our mouth the conversation drifted onto the familiar topic of food which was had only between the ohhs mmms and yumms of the pork nugget and cheese curd goodness we conversed about the previous meal we had had at char no and although we knew our meal would be good we also knew it would never outdo the amazing choice i had picked last time we had dined here you see on date nights i always win in the picking of the best dish category and our first trip to char no may have been the best date meal ive ever had i had ordered an appetizer salad and one of the specials the most amazing pasta dish i have ever ordered and the most amazing chefs special i have ever ordered the gnocchi with a boar rag√π it was simply divine i have dreams about it i have nightmares that it may have all been a dream it was simply one of the best things ive ever eaten and back again for a second time at char no we waited for our main courses while we order our second drinks a play on an arnold palmer and if id stuck to just one maybe id remember its name but it doesnt really matter as all their bourbon cocktails are worth the trip alone or even better get a flight of bourbon or scotch or whisky or be boring and stick with the typical dinner flare and get wineas our plates hit the table we looked up at each other wideeyed and bushytailed and once again silence feel as we took our first bites the bbq sauce for the ribs had a perfect mix of sweet and spice and the honey butter that comes on the side for the cornbread is another item id love to purchase from a shelf the boys lamb and white beans was much to salty and a little on the rare side for my taste but all in all a fine choice once again i won best dinner choice we were stuffed and happy but not as happy as we were once we ordered a dessert the keylime pie is scrumptious tart and tangy with a covering of perfect marshmallow margarine sitting on beautiful gram crust a perfect ending to a perfect datechar no the best gnocchi ive ever had nough said

there are quite a few successful japanese restaurants in new york city that make you feel like you have stepped into japan when you walk through the doors but none more so than newcomer cocoron in the lower east side the treatment is so spot on so friendly and welcoming and the food so good that i cannot imagine why this place is not more crowded when i visit fine for me but i want this place around a long timecould soba be the trend of surely it is worthy of such enthusiasm like ramen has acquired the past few years but hopefully the quality remains high if new soba specialists openthere are many small plates to choose from to begin your meal and we had a go at a few the tastiest of which in my opinion was the japanese coleslaw which used purple radish and a sesame dressing that you find in premeal salads for a fried fix try either the chicken or croquettes both tried and true methods of getting the taste buds on the path to happinessbut the most serious part of cocoron is the soba itself noodles which will warm your heart if they have done what they desire here the shops top soba and most expensive is the yuba soba yuba is the tofu skins that you see to the left and the dish is served with a hot dipping sauceyou can also use the same cold noodle to hot dipping sauce technique with the popular stamina soba or have a hot bowl with the oroshi this is fairly light and the title refers to the gooey grated daikon radish you see plopped on topbe ready to get warned about the natto soba if you do not look like someone that has eaten it before natto is a fermented soybean and has a strong taste but is really not something most people would object to on cold soba and mixed with egg soy onions and crushed sesame seeds this dish is an amazing taste experience sour and sweet and salty at the same timeour group kept feeling curious despite our full bellies so we went ahead and ordered the black sesame cheesecake and yomogi mochi neither was sweet at all and might disappoint the casual dessert eater but the cheesecake was especially unique and enjoyableone small point of advice though make sure you sit at the counter on a second visit i sat at a table and felt much less a part of the workings of the place and even a little forgotten about if there is a wait for seats at the counter do yourself a favor and wait for them

lets get something straight im a runner so i normally do not engage in class workouts however a friend of mine who lives in astoria tried this place out raved abou it and for my birthday decided to get me a free bootcamp and zumba class is she trying to give me a hint i meaaaaannni was a little skeptical at first because i normally dont believe that class workouts can give me the same outcomes as my intense runs howeveri tried the bootcamp out last week with raymond one of the owners and it was ahhhhmazing ive never sweated so hard in my life my core was super sore for about two days thinking this could not get any better i then tried out their zumba class today the instructor marsha was so helpful and energetic she made sure she got my name right which is a plus since no one ever gets my name on the first try they could tell i was fairly new and they gave me a tour of the facility which was super cute and clean i never realized how much i could sweat dancing marsha kept us all enthused and i was uber pumped up by the end of the session ill definitely be back i may have to put my runs to a halt so that i can get my zumba on
two words pretty awesome i think about popping into hancos every time i head for the bergen st stop the shop is small with a few seats translation no bathroom for you and a friendly staffi have only been to a few banh mi places in ny but this is the only one that i would willingly stuff one down my tummy even when im not hungry ah the gluttony i have tried all the variations except the chicken vegetarian and the sardine ones they were all thumbs up their spring rolls are alright nothing to write about bubble tea is ok too although i obviously prefer ten rens better so apparently hancos vietnamese sandwiches are slightly overpriced but im ok with it why because it is delicious and good enough to fill you up under you get ripped off most of the times when you go have brunch but hey you still go for it
as a reward for dogsitting my friends two incredibly easytocarefor little dogs my friends decided to treat me to a dinner at good fork for about a month we tried to schedule a time when all three of us would be available and finally we made it to the restaurant this past sundaywe drove from queens to red hook this was the first time ive been to red hook and what a random neighbourhood for a restaurant like this to be located walking in we immediately transitioned from a quiet and emptylooking brooklyn neighbourhood to a lively yet dimly lit and very cozy dining atmosphere our party of three was quickly ushered to a table in the back and handed menus my friend had bought a groupon for good fork with which each of us would pick a starter and main entree a side and a dessert i love bitter greens so for me the roasted brussels sprouts was a nobrainer as a starter on the main entree section of the menu the applebraised wild boar shank quickly caught my attention but at first i was unsure about the grits that would be a part of this dish i do not like grits but in the end i decided i needed to try this wild boar shank i originally wanted to have the mashed potatoes for the side but they had ran out already and so i picked the onion ringsthe roasted brussels sprouts came with a poached egg serrano ham arugula and caesar dressing thinking about this dish as i write this review is actually making me hungry the combination of ingredients in this dish made it absolutely amazing and especially so because of the bitterness of the brussels sprouts and the saltiness of the serrano ham the brussels sprouts were cooked to a nice and tender texture and the serrano ham was cut into tiny slices and made almost crispy the contrast between these two ingredients had me thinking that chef sohui kim was a genius up next was the main entree of applebraised wild boar shank it came with smoked bacon creamy grits mustard green and pickled apple with the shank itself sitting in a bed of grits i was naturally hesitant about the grits but since i did order it of course i was going to try it and i had to admit that i actually liked it it was very creamy and just a bit buttery with a hint of pepper which really rounded out the flavour the shank itself was incredible the meat literally slid off the bone as i applied the slightest pressure to it it was flavourful satisfying and meaty i could not stop dipping the meat in the grits in order to eat both in the same bite the side of onion rings was made with tempura flour which made it a lot softer and milder than how it is usually made in most other restaurants it was an interesting way of making onion rings which i had never tried before and they were also very tasty i topped off the dinner with a dessert of spiced pecan pie while it wasnt the most amazing pecan pie i ever had it was still very good and was just what i needed to further stuff myself after the extremely delicious dinner im not sure when ill be going back to good fork since its not subway accessible but oh you can bet your bottom dollar that ill be back
things to know about the ten looking for a sign dont bother ten bells isnt written on the outside or anywhere i could see inside dont wait for menu its written on the oysters from while the local fire island oysters were fine i really enjoyed the old salt oysters from va larger meatier and brinier than the locals i was disappointed not see them on menu on a subsequent visit luckily i was very pleased with the maleque on par taste wise but not size wise to the old yes i ate oyster in one sitting dont judge me overwhelmed by wine choices trust the host recommendations ive been happy with their sometimes wine suggestion is too good nothing like looking at bill and realizing you spent more on wine than food no reason to be concerned nope none at all tapas to get for meat eaters shrimp nachos duck rillettes sort of like pate and empanada i had a wonderful chorizo cheese there are choices for the nonmeat eating crowd besides the usual cheese plates and salads the menu had eggplant mushroom puff pastry and an artichoke and cheese dish i shared and enjoyed a the food friendliness and ambiance makes this one of the better tapas bars to eat at
to say i really like this charming place would be an understatement the decor was eclectic simpatico and amusing we were fortunate to be sitting next to the windows and discussed at some length the way the light hit the windows of the building across the street which in turn reflected golden beams of sunlight onto the mirrors on the wall of the restaurant which in turn bathed the lovely senorita l in a rosy glow we also had a silly discussion about a strange but amusing statue in the room of a nude woman her head was disproportionately small her facial features were rudimentary in contrast to the rendering of her torso what amused us most though was the elaborate and peculiarly stylized depiction of her pubic hairit is a petite place perhaps a bit too petite if one has claustrophobic inclinations i wonder if the name of the restaurant is ironically redundant as it is in englishthe server was a wonderful character she had a kindness and joie de vivre about her that contributed to the rosy glow and bon ami ambiance briana m was kind enough to go out and buy a fine malbec that was perfect with our meal imagine my surprise when i ordered the thai curry cod and it was as fabulous as mr unluckys secret soup surprise i guess great minds think alike the cod had a perfect texture and each bite of gingery coconut rich brothy morsel was savored
two girlfriends treated me to a wonderful meal at degustation for my birthday theres no need to walk you through a shpeel of the courses served as the menu changes every few weeks each dish was expertly executed providing a treat for all the senses the smells that circulate the room along with the sounds of trained chefs at work increase the anticipation for the course to come beautifully composed dishes delighted the eyes the myriad of textures that dance in the mouth and the bursts of flavors infused into each dish brought my mouth to orgasm the decor is sexy intimate and the entire restaurant is just large enough to house the the bar that surrounds the kitchen eliminating any distractions and allowing diners to revel in this culinary adventure being spoiled by chefs who usually engage those who sit at the bar i was slightly disappointed that the chefs barely interacted with the diners though the former is easily forgiven by having a highly competent host that assumed the role of introducing each dish and ensuring that our experience was nothing less than spectacular the price is an affordable indulgence that id like to experience again although dishes are on the small side the courses will leave you full but perhaps hungry to try more
when it comes to food i like to think of myself as a renaissance man from burger king to buddakan i like it all my bank balance generally keeps me toward the middle of that scale but who doesnt love to splurge for a special occasion thats what brought me to buddakan and i was not disappointedfirst off the place is gargantuan it felt like my date and i walked an entire city block between the coat check and our table but it gave me ample time to scour the plates on the other diners tables to see what looked good my date who does not eat like a bird thankfully and i decided to start with the scallion pancakes which are topped with the most succulent shredded beef short rib meat ive ever consumed we also had the szechuan pork dumplings which are served in a spicy chilisoy broth yumnext came the broken chili chicken which also carried a bit of a kick just enough to add some flavor and some spice but not to the point of pain what made it really memorable was the crispiness of the fried part on the outside combined with the juiciness of the meat and the spicy sauce we also had the lobster fried rice which was tasty probably the weakest dish that we had dessert totally made up for it thoughthe chocolate peanut butter bombe was amazing with peanut butter ice cream the perfect complement to the chocolate think reeses peanut butter cups on steroidsi have no complaints on the service our waitress was attentive without being overbearing we were seated promptly be sure to make a reservation early if possible and our glasses were never emptyi had one of the best meals ive had in new york at buddakan and ill definitely be back at some pointi hope it will be with the same hot date who also gets a rating
i still remember the pink bus and the craziness of burrito bar i never once went into province had an awful delivery episode with them after waiting for months the day has come stuzzicheria opened to the public last night and it was hot bar seats were super comfy max worked the bar and couldnt have been nicer and the food blew us away at one point we thought we got our own version of italian boqueria on our very corner now the small plates we had were the pecorino and some kind of a delicious salumi fantastic the olives we had were so meaty and flavorful i could have kept on eating them all night my boyfriend got the bucatini amatrciana i think and i went with the creamy pistachio and lemon tagliolini my pasta was so rich but not too heavy so full of flavor completely up my alley as i am not a fan of red saucesthe menu is extensive and everything on it sounded so amazing i only kept wishing i went to stuzzicheria earlier than to really indulge and pig out to the point someone can roll me up half a block to my front door the place was busy the staff was super friendly the decor is quite nice and welcoming i am looking forward to cominb back soon to try the arancini the meatballs the sausage the list goes on i was too full last night but saw they had an orange olive oil cake i think it was in retrospect i should have taken it to go welcome to the neighborhood stuzzicheria now please consider outdoor seating ok thanksxo
my boyfriend lured me into going to red hook and all it took was a nearly perfect sunny saturday afternoon a free ferry ride lobster rolls and planting visions of sinking my teeth into some grasshopper pie from baked which is down the street from this place into my brain soldthey made an appearance at the parked food cart festival at governors island last weekend and unfortunately they ran out way before the event was over as did most of the trucks that were there that day i vowed to try them out at their bricks and mortar location one day and this was definitely the day for that for you get a lobster roll that is loaded with fresh and juicy maine lobster mixed with just the right amount of mayo on a bed of lettuce and a grilled buttered hot dog bun with cape cod potato chips and a fresh homemade dill pickle this was complete with a blueberry maine root soda we sat next door in the seating area after we ordered and picked up our food everything was made to order and amazingly delicious the seating area is really no frills picnic tables that appear to be inside some type of small warehouse they keep the area clean and do recycling of the bottles if you are a fan of lobster rolls this is the place to go highly recommended
i love checking out new restaurants in astoria and its surrounding neighborhoods so when elle p clued me in on salt fat we made plans to have dinner there over the weekend salt fat had their grand opening on friday so imagine our surprise to find that they already had a small crowd waiting for tables on their opening weekend i guess good news travels fast the space was very modest just a small rectangular room with booth seating along one wall and tables for two along the other wall the walkway down the center of the room was unnecessarily wide so i think there must be a way they can rearrange their tables to get more use out of their space the decor was simple clean and minimalistsalt fat offers a strong substantial menu of seasonal small plates featuring a globallyinfluenced american style bringing to mind a comparison to traif brooklyns favorite baby last year when we were seated our waitress brought us a complimentary starter of popcorn in a little brown bag along with the menus the popcorn is popped in bacon fat to give it a little something extra mmmm baconthe two of us sharedyellowtail with italian speck pickled jalape√±o citrus this dish was a great way to start the meal very refreshing and light i thought the prosciutto slightly overpowered the fish so i preferred to pair the yellowtail with the pickled jalape√±o and the prosciutto with the grapefruit scallops with roasted carrot pur√©e truffled golden beets i loved the combination of the buttery scallops sweet carrot pur√©e and luscious veggies the only flaw to this dish was that two out of the three scallops were just slightly overdone braised pork belly tacos with pico de gallo kimchi salsa queso fresco all of the asian fusion tacos ive previously eaten used a soft tortilla but to my delight salt fats taco used a hard shell love it the pork belly was perfectly braised and just fatty enough and together with the accompanying fillings provided a flavorpacked mouthful i was also happy to see more of the pickled jalape√±o on the sideshort rib buns with pickled cucumber apricot mustard like the scallops dish there was a small issue of one of the short ribs being slightly overdone other than that the buns and fillings were very tasty and wellbalanced though perhaps not as inspired as some of the other dishesoxtail terrine with caramelized onion pur√©e roasted mushrooms out of all the yummy dishes we had this one was my favorite the oxtail terrine was succulent and the onion pur√©e had a lovely smokiness that brought out the nutty flavors of the shimeji mushrooms each bite was rich savory blisslychee panna cotta with plum vinegar gastrique yuzu buttermilk sorbet the panna cotta was perfectly creamy the lychee flavor was bright but not overpowering and went well with the mellow gastrique the yuzu sorbet provided a welcome tartness though it was on the icy sidesunnyside is lucky to have this new neighborhood gem the restaurant was surprisingly on the ball for their third night dinner service ran smoothly and the servers were friendly and knowledgeable elle and i were especially impressed with their timing our dishes were brought to us one by one the next dish following just minutes after the previous dish was taken away the chef de cuisine or was it our server even arranged our dishes from lightest to heaviest little bottles of biofeel yogurt drink came with the bill i grew up with this stuff so i thought it was a cute nostalgic way to leave one last good impression i was really impressed and satisfied with salt fats creative delicious and beautifullypresented food at last queens has its own traiflike darling if only it were located in my part of queensbiofeel korean version aka yakult japanese version aka yang le duo chinese versioncash only for the first weekno alcohol yet
my bucket list is probably a reflection of my type a perfectionist personality although i have scratched riding in a ferrari off the list i still have an onslaught of other important items such as living in spain having my bachelorette party during oktoberfest in munich skydiving and eating at le bernardinthe bucket list is one item shorter now because i had the honor yes it really is an honor and pleasure of dining at le bernardin this past week deep down on the inside i was hoping that eric ripert swoon would be on location but this just means that i am going to add meet eric ripert at le bernardin onto my bucket listthe service was incredible i have never been so catered to in my entire life from the person who greeted me at the door to the sommelier that i chatted with regarding bordeauxs to the guy that pulls your chair out for you when he sees you returning from the ladies roomits just specialand that was exactly how dinner at le bernardin was special one of those moments i will never forget deciding which menu to order from was a difficult decision we opted for the le bernardin tasting menu mainly because i can only eat so much lesson learned from moto and i had my heart set on the black bassafter our wine was poured a la dame de montrose bordeaux that was amazing when poured and only tasted even more of juicy red fruits when allowed to breathe and our bread selections were made try the grain it was time to beginthe amuse bouche was an oyster in foam with tiny bits of mushroom it was so aromatic flavorful and had me anticipating the rest of dinner the courses in order are as followsthinly pounded yellowfin tuna served over a toasted baguette oh my goodness i didnt believe fish could be so thinly served in my entire life it was extremely mild but the shaved chives which are symmetrically strewn on top of the fish and olive oil provided a nice variation to this fishcharred octopus fermented black bean pear sauce vierge miso vinaigrette ink the octopus used is from spain and the kind you use for pulpo a la gallega it was hard to believe i was eating octopus as i am so accostomed to toughness the waiter poured the fermented black bean onto the octopus which was sweetsmelling and the taste contrasted nicely with the tangy pearlobster carpaccio with hearts of palm this lobster was so sweet you could have served it to me for dessert the hearts of palm were slivered in such a way that with each bite there was a delicate crunch the entire dish was dressed in a light butter sauce which seemed very savory in comparison to how sweet the lobster wasseared yellowtail with truffle risotto when the waiter poured the truffle emulsion onto the yellowtail i smelled the earthy aroma immediately the tuna was firm yet it just melted in my mouth you will scoff at truffle oil after eating this dishblack bass beansprout risotto and mini steamed buns the firm black bass was a great contrast to the crunchy beansprouts and the fluffy slightly spongy texture of the lup cheong sausage mini bun what i loved about this fish is that it is a white firm flesh but the taste is as delicate as a flounder was this dish everything i had hoped for and more yesour predessert course was parsnip creme brulee with hazelnut personally i loved the browned milk solids which gave a touch of bitterness to the sweet yes sweet and tangy parsnip overall the dish was also a wonderful play on texturesmilk chocolate parfait with liquid pear pear and chocolate is one of my favorite dessert combinations so this was a real treat the parfait has a very granular texture and although this was milk and not dark chocolate the gingersnap balanced the sweetnesstime for petit fours and coffee we asked for french press coffee and although it is not on the menu one of the waiters more than happily brought it out to us and it was delicious i could have eaten an entire tray of the little tartlike petit fours the second in the photothis was one of the standout meals of my life it was a surreal experience for me to actually be dining here and makes me feel so grateful for the things that i haveif you asked me to pick a favorite course i really could not pick one honestly i couldnt even rank each of them thats how incredible and unique each plate was le bernardin deserves every one of its three michelin stars and i hope that everyone at some point has the opportunity to dine here
review dedication catherine hot sauce j without her splendid suggestion on wine one would not have been privy to an elegant and well balanced glass of barolo under the lights of a diminutive yet enchanting atmospherethe setting despite its petite nature and assembly the view from the outer confines of wine reveals an opulent story the subtle yet sensual atmospheric feel of the establishment embodies the first major principle in such a venue a little note on wine the is derived from the number of seating available at the restaurant this includes both the bar and table seating entry into wine will reveal the modest space of this institution to be both warm and vibrant from the constant activity in the viewable kitchen to the low key and laid back feel of all attending patrons the wine bar itself produces a harmonic beat and relaxing experience seating at the bar area provides ample spacing for attendees to move freely without interrupting guests in adjacent seating all of the tables in the establishment provide an excellent view of the entire establishment while embodying the natural light derived from the outer confines and tranquil surroundings of the murray hill neighborhoodthe service needless to say the service at wine is directly indicative of the hospitable feel of the establishment from first entry a simplistic greeting with a smile followed by an elegant graceful address by the attending bartender set the foundation for the evenings endeavors on more than to occasions my water glass was refilled without request the bartender was also careful in their selection of my second wine choice which did not disappoint as i rendered the responsibility to the attending bartender based on my strict preferences during the course of the evening a request to change seating to a more view friendly area of the bar was embraced and granted without refrain such notable hospitality should set the foundation for how service should be rendered at all other wine bar establishmentsthe cantina terra del barolo despite its youthful complexity and age the intricacies of the cantina terra del barolo did not disappoint the ripe flavors of grape and oak are presented throughout each sip of the wine with each additional sip enhancing the structure of both the bold burgundy body and the hints of oak present through the aging process the best way to truly classify this remarkable wine is to identify both its bold and deep complexity although the finish itself possessed a clean to the tongue touch thus indicating its age the overall flavor profile ranging from the mild oaky taste to the complex muskiness allowed for this barolo to be a true every day consumablebarbera d asti given that this was the surprise wine of the evening it was nothing short of a spectacular selection with the label hidden and no physically similar wine bottle in sight it was up to judging this wine by taste and taste alone a proper aromatic test of the wine indicated hints of tobacco smokiness which was accompanied by a well balanced dryness at first taste a notable presence of acidity and spice was detected with a medium bodily structure in terms of the complexity of the wine the main flavor profiles of the consumable were established the guess barbera d asti with a quaint smile and obligatory acknowledgment my bartender had confirmed the response unfortunately no prizes were awarded as i was still stuck with having to pay for the in the evening with glasses of classic italian reds consumed it was off to dinner with its splendid interior features and cordial staff theres very little doubt that a return trip to wine is all but certain perhaps snacking will be in order for the next visitnotes on wine edibles ranging from cheese charcuterie options to sliders w gruyere are available for per glass wine selections range from to not in the mood for wine wine offers palm from the draft along with numerous other bottled suggested seating at the bar leave yourself to the attending care of the bartender
for years i did not like macarons because the cute little sweet dessert sandwiches looked adorable and delicious but whenever i bit in the inevitable disappointment of the brittleness of the crust and lackluster center and yet disappointment after disappointment i kept ordering because i must not have learned my lesson the first or second third etc time around and i couldnt get over the incongruity of the look and taste and figured someone somewhere must make a macaron that actually tasted like how it looked pure deliciousnessthank goodness for my eternal optimism otherwise i would have never given la maison du macaron a try some years ago i wasnt living here then i was visiting on a work trip i had a few hours to spare and spent a delightful afternoon mindlessly wandering up and down the streets with no agenda in mind and i found myself in front of madeleine as it was known back then once again the sweet little cookies beckoned to me i succumbed even though i had mentally resigned myself to disappointmentbut one bite proved me ohsowrong this was what i was looking for my eyes widened and i immediately went back and bought moreyou see all the other macarons i had were old and stale sitting around getting drier and staler as they sat prettily in glass jars or counters but at la maison the macarons are always fresh the sandwich part is supposed to be soft and tender not crunchy and brittle the center filling is always smooth creamy fragrant and utterly seductivetheyre beautiful little jewels of epicurean delight it doesnt matter which flavor you get theyre all incredible and ive never been disappointed or saddened by these ive eaten macarons up and down manhattan and i havent found a better macaron than the ones here
the first thing i do when i enter my apartment is put my keys on my bookshelf at eye level so i can always see them i do this because i once left my keys in my lock overnight and have since been scared straight or so i thought or so i thought that i thought youll get that laterthe evening before my birthday i got home late and while chatting on the phone i put my keys in their usual spot or so i thought please see above the next morning on my birthday feeling special and loved by all the birthday love i got dolled up and was on my way to work with extra mascara on because i would be meeting up with my friends afterwork for some celebratory cocktails i put on my coat scarf hat mitten just the left one and reached for my keys with my unmittened hand butthey werent there i looked around for an hour and couldnt find them i then realized that i could have left them in the door overnight and opened the door hoping that theyd be there and they werent so my next logical thought was that a ghost had taken them and hid them because thats what poltergeists do right now im never eating chicken in my apt again or using my bathroom sink please see eventually i calmed down and decided that an old lady in my building took my keys and is now waiting to steal my stuff what a jerk so i basically go on this rampage of hiding all of my stuff some of which i still cannot find and leave for work stressed out about not being able to find my keys with my apartment completely turned upside down having spoken to a locksmith that wanted to charge me starting at for a cylinder a cylinder and my super being on vacation i head out for work hours late on my way to the train station my supervisor texts me and tells me not to go and enjoy my day off cool bam i look up and theres the bx alehouse and its opened and i need a drink i sit at the bar and with tears in my eyes tell the bartender that im having a rough morning and its my birthday and its not fair and i cant find my keys and i and he gives me a shot and a beer and i feel better then i start to swap birthday drama stories with this guy at the bar and i realized just how much i love this placeits not a neighborhood bar in the usual definition the rumors are true food is awesome beer selection is amazing prices are great and the service is stellar my only qualm is their lack of hiphop music on the jukebox i mean it is the bronx the birth place of hiphop get with it i eventually found them they fell behind my bookcase im slightly stupid
its shame that i only recently discovered this place six years after i use to work one block away for nearly and years but the universe smile down upon me in the form of a yelp deal and i was finally afforded this chance meeting with hatsuhana i couldnt resist the for worth of food that was being offered as a discount so i came here with others fully aware that i would probably have to shell out to a bit more to compensate for the rest of the bill however much that would amount to at the end of our meal if not for yelp i would have never come here since ive never heard of this place in the foodie circle ive heard of other infamous sushi restaurants sushi yasuda which i have also been to but never hatsuhana yet i was comforted in knowing that this restaurant has been around since and the star yelp aggregate review really set some high expectations for my first time here let me sum up my experience by saying that not only did hatsuhana blow me away but i will be bold enough to say that i even think it is better than sushi yasuda i am not exaggerating when i say that this was a completely impeccable dinner the food was outstanding the service was onpoint and we were all wildly impressed we ordered four appetizers to share aburi toro lightly seared fatty tuna slices served with a hearty garlic soy sauce agedashi tofu deep fried tofu in a soy sauce based broth served with ground ginger radish garnish lobster tempura a half tail of lobster fried in tempura batter and their japanese style calamari there was not one thing about any of these dishes i could critique the tuna was buttery and cool fresh and utterly amazing bathed in that garlic soy the age tofu though fried was soft and pillowy and its skin salty and sweet was so delicious i had never tasted anything like it before the lobster tempura and calamari were both delicately fried the tempura batter was crispy and did not taste heavy at all spectacular as for my entree i passed on the popular box of dreams fearing it would be a bit too much instead i ordered their chirashi an assortment of sliced raw fish fillets and other delicacies served on a bed of sushi rice in a bowl i have had fantastic chirashi at other sushi restaurants most notably at sushi yasuda but hatsuhanas was remarkably fresher and the presentation was so gorgeous i almost did not want to dig into it i truly appreciated the attention to detail where even the wedges of sweet egg were branded with the restaurants name hatsuhana on its side this meal made me smile as i ate the best chirashi i have ever had anywhere we didnt try any of their desserts as i had brought a box of levains notoriously monstrous cookies as a great way to end our meal as we were chomping down on our cookies the waiter actually brought us dessert plates so that we would look less like savages devouring our sweet confections i thought that was oddly gracious and spoke of their professionalism and kindness before leaving i had been so stunned by how great and fresh the food was that i had felt compelled to order a number of rolls to take to my boyfriend who was working late and unable to join us as soon as i met him i told him to get started on the rolls and as he began eating them spicy scallop salmon skin yellowtail he said wow this fish is so fresh its remarkable and all i could do was agree with full enthusiasm i cant wait to become a regular at hatsuhana they have a great prefixe menu if you are dining on a budget an excellent meal at hatsuhana does not have to cost you and arm and leg but even if it is more expensive than what youd prefer trust that you are going to have an extraordinary meal with the freshest and most delicious ingredients rendering you utterly satisfied
hands down the best breakfast in the city whats the catch oh theres many shopsins is kind of notorious in manhattan the soup nazi from seinfeld fame looks like a cuddly teddy bear compared to the staff here really though i dont find the staff to be unreasonable they simply want you to show respect for their business and for them personally if you can contain your personality enough to do that you will be rewarded with an absolutely amazing breakfast if you cant you may literally be kicked out of the restaurant no joke during our visit we counted two offenders the first was a lady who was standing in line for the adjacent cheese shop and took it upon herself to grab a chair from shopsins to have a seat while she was waiting for her cheese now think about that for a moment there are only chairs out on the main floor for the entire restaurant she walked into the restaurant and took one of them what reaction would that garner from any restaurant owner of course they yelled at her that it was their chair that she was taking she wasnt even a customer another gentleman walked in and took a seat put down his stuff on the adjacent seat and told the waiter that he will just have a coffee to start and that he was waiting for his friends to show up the waiter explained that he will need to wait for his friends to show up first before he can be seated and further he would have to wait by the wall until he was directed to take a table the guy then said oh i was lying its just me i am going to eat by myself to which the waiter said well i cant serve you then since you lied to me the guy became huffy and walked off in disbelief he didnt respect the fact that he needed to wait in order to be seated and that he couldnt be seated until his entire party arrived heck these are the rules at olive garden what is so difficult to follow here again just show respect and you will be fine be an impatient pushy entitled lying jerk and earn the wrath you are due so if you can survive actually acquiring a table then you are in for a true reward the menu is crazy large and you cant possibly know what to order the answer is simple enough though anything seriously everything is good here you cant mess up its idiotproofi began with the crisp hash eggs and toast breakfast special which i took with the mexi option which includes chicken chorizo and hatch what an amazing hash note the double exclamation points the texture of the potatoes was simply perfect so crisp and yet flavorful folded into the mix i really enjoyed the spicy chorizo and the assertiveness of the hatch a mexican chile for a dish that you would expect to be pretty heavy it wasnt that way at all a great balance of flavors that had me eating more than i could have thought possible i finished the very large portion with nary a moment of hesitation additionally my choice of scrambled eggs was nicely done softer than i usually encounter for dessert if you will we went with the ebelskivers i was first introduced to these delights in solvang ca i was taken with them at first sight but i never realized that they could be improved upon by far these were the best ebelskivers i have ever had the airiness quality in them is something else our bowl housed of these heavenly bodies all surrounding a central cup filled with freshly made schlag take one dip it into that creamy goodness bite and savor the moment what a perfect way to cap any meal given that huge menu i so want to come back here again and again and try just about everything else the prices are on the high end for breakfast but the quality of the food absolutely merits it just make sure you are on your best manners when you go a little bit of humility in life will reward you richly enjoy

ive watched chef harold dieterles assent to culinary relevance with interest it arguably started with a close win in top chef punctuated by a unmistakable success in perilla and recently rekindled with the opening of kin shop in the west village while kin shop didnt have the flash and pomp as a michael white or jonathon benno opening its a terrific addition to a new york restaurant scene thats in sore need of upscale yet honest thai foodthe decor and scene is muted bordering on boring but without an ounce of pretension the most exciting visual element is the open air kitchen at the rear of the restaurant where a lucky few customers eating the at the bar can watch the cooks at work service is casual and efficientweve seen flashes of brilliance in the subtle thai flavors at perilla and now we get the full thing at kin shop the curry sauce accompanying a starter of bay scallops was so good i was left awkwardly clawing at the plate with my fork to scrape up the last puddle of sauce a side of preserved watercress mustard greens was assertively spicy and bold though unbearably pungent despite a multitoothbrush and mouthwash circuit the stench of preserved greens was recriminate on my breaththe real star of the show was a massaman goat curry the slowly braised goat neck was fork tender and impossibly fragrant a truly noble end for our goaty friend a sliced duck breast is simply paired with fresh herbs and is meant to be placed in a pocket of crispy roti and drizzled with a red curry an absolutely superb bite of food this restaurant shares kinship with the scene and prices of other west village restaurants but compared to the other thai joints in the city its a brother from another mother
minetta tavern with its impressive reputation seems out of place as it is located in the middle of an area of macdougal street better known for its bar scene and fast food joints the unassuming exterior with its black curtained windows hides a dimly lit tavern with a sense of history surprisingly for a restaurant of this caliber the interior feels very cramped and i mean that in a hey i am seated right next to a stranger from the table next to me a mere foot and a half away kind of way they were packing in the customers like sardines in there to make use of every inch of space available not that big a deal if the person sitting at the next table is a pretty girl or handsome guy if that floats your boat more but not so great if its a sweaty fat dude if you want a private romantic date this is not the place to bedespite how they cram people into its space getting a table is pretty hard be prepared to book up to a month in advance if you dont want to wait that long to try out their menu you could always scrap the idea of eating at the table and dine at the bar instead ive read that you could get any of the food from the menu there anywayminetta tavern is well known for their black label burger and that was what my dining companion and i ordered the burger patty is a blend of dry aged rib eye ny strip skirt steak and brisket the meat was rich beefy tasting soft and perfectly medium rare in the center as i had ordered the exterior of the beef patty also have this nice crispy charred coating to it that gives it a nice contrasting texture with each bite the burger comes with lettuce tomatoes and a generous helping of caramelized onions sandwiched between a soft bun there is an option to add cheese to the burger but the burger is rich enough without it besides you are already paying for this incredible burger how much more expensive do you want to make it along with the burger the plate came with a crispy pickle slice and a large pile of fries the fries are cut shoe string style and reminds me of the best fries that mcdonalds made before they changed their recipe to be more health conscious normally comparing something to mcdonalds is an insult akin to ha ha your food tastes like crap but for this i consider it high praiseas a side dish we also ordered the bone marrow this came with large halves of bones split down the middle to get to the marrow in the center the marrow when combined with the crispy bread and sharp sweet shallot spread was decadently rich and flavorful in terms of the high end bone marrows that i have tried in nyc i would rate blue ribbons with its amazing oxtail spread in first place this in second and landmarcs as third would i pay for this burger again yes i would but maybe only once or so a year its not exactly cheap you know next time ill probably just eat by the bar because waiting a whole month to eat here when i have the cravings for it is not exactly going to be fun

this is my favorite booze joint these days located on a side street in a desolate stretch of gowanus the sackett is small but never crowded the jukebox pumps out excellent tunes at a conversationfriendly volume and the bartender is super sweet it also doesnt hurt that his generous pours and gentle prices ensure a quick buzz for those with a high tolerance and limited meansthe regulars at the bar will invite you to join their conversation and theres no shame in ordering a drink with just two or three ingredients its the perfect antidote after a string of fancy sceney mixology places that left me broke hoarse and thirsty for more straightforward libations and less pretentious patrons id recommend this place for a date quiet gettogether with a friend and getting drunk on the cheap without the olfactory trappings of a dive bar think more classy less assysome other things to note happy hour pm mon tues off drinks wed sun off about four beers on tap one of which is brooklyn ipa no food served while they await their inspection from the health department but theyre stocked with more takeout menus than your local chinese delivery guy we once ordered banh mi from the superquick vietnamese place and the food arrived before the song finished playing on the juke box on a recent visit my glass of dark stormy was rum and ginger beer this is my review im expecting streamers and confetti to rain down on me as soon as i click the post button

alchemy a philosophy and an ancient practice focused on attempting to change base metals into gold investigating the preparation of the elixir of longevity and achieving ultimate wisdompure alchemy the science of understanding deconstructing and reconstructing matter how else can you explain the use of soy nut or coconut milk to form the base for a dozen rotating sensational flavors made in small batches every dayi have never believed in vegan or dairy free desserts though i have often given many a chance at the same time the contrarian in me is quick to pooh pooh the latest chart buster as ephemeral and a momentary aberration this was thus a double whammy for i could find no fault with lulas decadent flavors wholly natural and organic philosophy quality ingredients retro d√©cor warm patient and gracious service simply flawless whats wrong with this picture i thought hard as i sat in tompkins square park finally a bulb flashed in my brain aha the taste of cashew was perhaps dominant in the two flavors i had tried peanut butter fudge and rocky road determined to put this theory to the test i was surprised when at my next visit both the lemon and orange creamsicle flavors tasted completely different and distinctivei can now understand why lulas has a cult following and why they routinely run out of almost the entire lot of daily flavors before pm on a weekendthe only annoying aspect about the entire experience is the indecisive crowd of patrons the line moves like molasses as people try out one flavor after another and still dont know what to commit to relax people this isnt a relationship take a deep breath let go and dont try to block the person behind you from taking a peek at the remaining options remember the big picture there will be more choices tomorrowspeaking of big picture i have often considered carrying a trick mirror with me to help the people waiting in line remember it may be natural but it still isnt guilt free now how about a run in tompkins park eh pure gold
when someone or something is extraordinary in spain we use to say is de pata negra there is no better spanish compliment than this because nothing is as good as the best ham in earth iberico which is made from pigs belonging to the iberian race those pigs are black negro or at least their nails are and as you know ham is the hind legs pata salted and cured for months hanging down over the cellar under specific temperature and humidity conditions and between the longer it hangs the better will render getting old is always good and yes in case you hear it before pata also refers to a female duck but it means leg too when talking about animals but not for humans be careful with this and when those pigs run free in the field and they are feed with acorn only during the months previous to the slaughtering then only then is when we have the best of the best de pata leg negra black happy pigs will always arise the most delightful ham at pata negra you can certainly taste the best of the best and this place is extraordinary not only because the ham served but for their tapas as well all this is served in a quiet ambiance of modern elegance and good taste focus is small details ideal for a date and a group of friends but not bigger than if you wanna stay in the same table the ham section includes different types of spanish ham and is ideally to share from serrano which is the most popular spanish ham made from white pigs and the one you have probably taste before and although its not de pata negra and therefore its less expensive dont get me wrong spanish ham is always delicious but the main attraction is many types of ibericos served as well as their combination plates with other types of cured meats our pata negra plate for imported from spain were said its a and a half years old older than the joint itself older than the time iberico has been available in usa the slices were served over a wood chopping table beautifully glowing in fat tender flavorful thin and served at room temperature just as it must beand with many bread slices soaked in olive oil and spread with tomato pur√©e as a side or what you will recognize as the popular pan tomaca a featured tapa even breakfast dish from catalonia when iberico i like to enjoy my ham alone but i also recommend to put one slice over a pan tomaca and eat it together that combination is just magical we couldnt help but keep ordering from this section friends said that they just wanted to compare ham types yes sure the extremadura plate was again extremely good slices of iberico ham manchego cheese chorizo and coppa this is italian cured meat by the way and pan tomaca of course plenty flavorful so good this is how we roll with pork in spain but this is ny and not even my loved socarrat serves a ham plate like this ones i have to say the cheese section is not extensive but the ones offered are a great selection its served with green apple slices raisins and nut bread and a figolive oil paste a large serving size for each the manchego that i tasted was really good because not all the manchegos are the same again timing is important and like with wine ham and even humans no the older the better the patitas section refers to toasted bread slices with different toppings its also known as tosta and our miniversion of what you know as open sandwich one order will give you for but as we were people we got the degustation plate that include one of each kind in total the quince and goat cheese that i tried was like the one i always have back at home we also order pan tomaca that was a bigger version of the side served with the ham but just as delicious omg i just always die with this when is done right and pulpo a la gallega octopus with paprika and it was so good that we had to order it again there is only a few options for vegetarians including the cheese quince patita tortilla pan tomaca asparagus and shiitake with eggs and we were advertise that everything with meat was meat pork even their logo is a pig a cute pig its not this a loud call for pork loverswe ended up being also like happy pigs really full and well feed with the best of best at each in total drinking a glass of house wine for because the siesta time was still happening from to every day and you must mention it and treated like at home or what its home for me like in spain it couldnt be more authentic in all the senses and thinking about it did you also hear the rumors about yelp wanna update their type of compliments just saying de pata negra it would be an awesome one just as a side note the acorn ham is priced upwards of a pound those are some of the most expensive hams in the world

yes im lactoseintolerant yes i carry around about a dozen lactaid pills wherever i go and no i dont always remember to take them before indulging in cheesy or milky goodness in the heat of the moment youve got to reach into your purse search frantically for it and spend minutes ripping open the packetand that can kill the moment im sure weve all been therei decided to just go for it so i had an unprotected cheesy encounter last night im paying for it today but boy was it worth it the cheesy encounter im referencing is the famed spinach gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce it wasnt even the dish i orderedi ordered my gnocchi with tomato sauce because i wanted to be good but my friend had to taunt me by ordering the dish the way its supposed to beand i found myself sneaking forkfuls every time she wasnt lookingit reminded me of the best gnocchi dish ive ever had until last night anyhow at a redsauce italian place called luigis in anaheim the gnocchi there was covered in alfredo sauce so it was a bit heavier and the gnocchi at malatesta were a bit fluffier maybe because they were made with spinach they literally melted in your mouth but they were served so piping hot that the first few bites didnt have time to melt before i had to swallow themmy other friend ordered the fettuccine with meat sauce and it was excellent as well not heavy but still hearty i kept stealing bites of his as well but the clear winner at the table with the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce this place was cheap for what youre gettingthe entrees were all around which is a steal for this neighborhood and the portion size the bottle of wine we ordered was the best pinot grigio ive ever had kossler i think it was but it was around we asked the bartenders if the cheaper one which was around would be a decent option and they assured us that the extra ten bucks would be worth it and it was it was silky smooth and just a hint of sweetness making for easy drinkingthe only thing i wasnt a fan of was the bread because it had rosemary in it and i cant stand rosemary food poisoning incident a while back that i still havent gotten over and they served the bread on a small plate and didnt bring another plate for oilvinegar most places bring each person their own plate so its a good thing i was with friends who i didnt mind sharing withthe wait wasnt bad either on a saturday night at three of us only had to wait about minutes they let us squeeze in to the bar area where we ordered our bottle of wine and chilled until we got our table its a great neighborhood and setting for people watching and they have all of the walls open to the outside definitely a great place to come with friends or a date highly recommend it
during daylight hours it is a bit hard to see into this restaurant and even identifying it is a bit difficult as the russian sign and elza fancy food corp are not the best clues for nonrussian speakers dont be timid though open the door and find the wonderful name of this place right on the top of the menusthe place is very nondescript with plain peach walls a very highmounted hd television set playing russian talk shows and no decoration only russian is heard within the confines korean women are in the kitchen and uzbek food is on the menu only in new york actually it is not so hard to fathom with a little history lesson even today koreans are immigrating to uzbekistan since the country already has a sizable population since koreans were forcibly deported here from far east russia back in the early to say the food has many influences with korean and russian brushes adding to the palate the kaksu is a cold surprise soup of lamb and pickled cucumbers it was refreshing and crisp for a hot day and made our order of the cucumbers side unnecessary as the tastes are the samewe were eager to dig into the delicious manti steamed lamb dumplings that are served with dill and a dollop of sour cream we also could not resist the plov another staple of uzbek cuisine while the dish will never blow your mind this version is very good with fatty meat chunks and lots of greasethe samsa also proved irresistible despite not really having room for it the flaky pastry feel apart nicely and was filled with the same delicious ground lamb that was found inside the mantiwe were really all smiles after visiting your motherinlaw and cannot wait to see her again on the next visit to brighton beach the place exudes charm and friendliness despite its humble character something you do not always get when in the vicinity of stonefaced russians
im a bit sad that ill be giving away one of the last restaurants in the area that has yet to be discovered by nonkoreans but good places deserve good reviews they do serve your average bbq kalbi bulgogi samgyupsal but what makes this place special is their ssam bab ssam is basically when you make a wrap for yourself for lack of a better description the wraps are made from any kind of leafy greens not just the lettuce they serve at most korean restaurants at jumakgol they give you a variety of greens different types of lettuce romaine red oak leaf lettuce bitter tango lettuce with sesame leaves and other greens which i do not know english names for its served with your choice of meat or grilled fish the grilled fish is toasted to perfection and when you sprinkle the juice of a lemon over it it gives it a nice zest on top of eliminating any negative fishiness that you might experience they also give you denjangjjigae soup made with fermented soybeans and gandenjang a really thick soup made with fermented soybeans the latter is very savory and you use it flavor your ssams this is the kind of food i grew up on my mother being from the country its hearty healthy and really really delicious and my mother approves as wellbe aware there are no englishpicture menus

okay this is by far the best middle eastern restaurant ive ever eaten at in my life i almost wanted to weep that i had to return to my home in manhattan because i know how far i am from my dear love tanoreen ive tried so many middle eastern restaurants in my life in the us only and its one of my favorite cuisines in the world and this one is a cut above the rest someone told me on yelp that the chefowner is palestinian if you want to know from what region in the middle east not only is everything moderately priced but everything is also plentiful and tastes outstandingi kinda had a hunch that this place would be great but the moment i tried one of the appetizer specials the hunch became reality i selected the mhammara appetizer which is not on the menu but was on the daily specials it looked like a heterogenous concoction of love im not exactly sure of all the constituents of this godlike substance but i do know at least that it had red bell peppers lemon tanoreen spices walnuts and corn i was having the time of my life spreading this thing all over soft and crunchy pitas that they brought us for the entree i had what i consider a quintessential barometer of the quality of a middle eastern establishment the kafta platter when it came i was nonplussed to tell you the truth because they were very generous on portion size the plate looked like a masterpiece the middle had the ground lamb the rice and the veggies and the plate was surrounded on the perimeter by tabouleh the whole combination of side dishes and main entree hit the spot in a way no manhattan restaurant has done to me yet im sick of walking around manhattan and seeing such pretentious elegant and flamboyant foods when i came here i felt like i wasnt being cheated at allthat i was just getting quality food thats all synchronized into a beautiful symphony and at honest prices also the service is above reproach it was perfect actually i called ahead to make reservations and when i arrived they greeted me by name and continued to greet me by name until i left i really have no complaints its my favorite middle eastern restaurant of all time and i cant wait to make visitors from out of town jealous now im sharing my experience with all of you
best vietnamese food in nyc no joke i like their menu a lot mainly because its not so predictable like most of the vietnamese joints out here in new york they have a lot of homestyle entrees along with appetizers and platter you may not recognize andor have ever heard of the pho delicious the noodles they use is slightly wider than most traditional pho i like that a lot the broth is clean not too oily and seasoned well the meat quality is pretty on point too the seafood fried rice is awesome and you cannot pass the banh mis cheaper priced than some other banh mi shops the quality here is top notch theres rice cakes cookies goi cuon summer rolls and other snacks to purchase at the deli part of the restaurant great for those who are on the go the service is great it would help if i spoke vietnamese or chinese but luckily i have friends that do they are mostly women who work there and cook and its a nice environment everyone is so nice and sweet even if its hot outside i still crave for this place like a crack head i love thanh da and am thankful for my friend ting s for introducing it to me d
i remember a summer of years ago in sicily by the beach there was this guy who every evening at sunset would set up a table and make pizza on the spot out of an oven that he made out of scrap construction bricks there would only be pizza margherita no other toppings and only slices i would eat a slice of this wonderful pizza while sitting by the sidewalk overlooking the sea a ceres in my hand while watching the sun slowly sink in the sea and thinking in amazement that africa was the closest land somewhere away on the horizoni love pizza pizza is one of the simplest and most unpretentious things you can sink your teeth into so why oh why is it so hard to find a half decent pizza in nycyouve got to love the story behind this place mark iacono opened lucali to save the local candy store of his carroll gardens youth from becoming a starbucks or dunkin donuts you can still see relics of the candy store hanging from the exposed brick walls the space is large simple and welcoming with a wonderful tin ceiling and the pizzamaking area right in the middle on plain sightas soon as our pizza arrived i could already tell it was a winner the smell was not only wonderful but you could smell every singe ingredient distinctly the basil the milky mozzarella and most of all the tomato sauce the crust is thin and crispy as it should be slightly charred and blistery with a wonderful simple taste this pizza was so wonderfully delicious and simple that trying to describe it in more words would just be a disservice to mark iaconowe came here on a saturday night at pm and there was a minutes this pizza is well worth the wait i cant wait to come backbyob and cash i suggest to get a beer at nearby abilene bar while you wait

things you need to know before enjoying this gustatory visual and visceral reservations are incredibly difficult to get i called in advance on at least occasions and there was no availability at any reasonable times only options were before or after know how i scored i made a reservation thorough yelps link on the il buco review site there are only tables for two people if that even if you request them theres no guarantee youll get them so you kinda have to be okay with dining very close to strangers at a long table for do not bother with the online menu this special restaurant has a beautiful menu that changes daily everything changes the appetizers the pasta dishes the main courses everything look up the light fixtures are works of art every one of them my favorite is the bronze lamp consisting of teapots each pouring out light and look around wooden bookshelves are stocked with bottles of olive oil and sea salt i challenge you to find the painting of an old man sticking his tongue out at you its quite this is not the place to be on a diet order something fabulous smoked prosciutto lasagna a steak unlike any youve ever had unheard ingredient combinations that will have you wriggling in your seat in anticipation this is also not the place to be thrifty do it up and do it confer with the sommelier do not trust your lovely date who thinks hes ordering a fancy bottle of red because he knows wines only to discover that he accidentally selected a white wine delicious one of the best wines ive ever had actually but he wouldve had his red had he actually asked but whos complaining not i im still in my happy food place
alright one asian dude and three cute asian girls all recommended these soup dumplings to me i know i should expand my circle of friends all within the time frame of a week the situation was dire i needed to pay these dumpling ladies a visit and so i didi was on a mission mission objectives were clear concise i was to extract most scrumptuos soup dumplings from the hands of the hostile yet ingenius soup dumpling ladies drop off site the warm and inviting confines of my mouthboy does this place get crowded on weekends this place was packed with lines rolling out the door i got pushed and poked around by old folks strollers and everything in between it was all worth it thoughi enjoyed my dumplings courtside at the nearby park as onlookers stared at me in pure envy and to add insult to injury every so often id throw an arrogant smirk or smile their way yeah man i was in soup dumpling heaven and i wanted everybody to knownow one cannot talk about soup dumplings and not mention joes shanghai i ordered the crab flavor soup dumplings the skin is pretty thin so you have to be careful two of them broke on me the meat filling tastes softer and fresher than joes but i thought the flavor was slightly sub par when compared to joes ill have to go back to try their standard pork soup dumplings as well as some other dishesas punishment for my postbreakfast but prelunch dumpling snack i walked myself home miles unfortunately temptation levels were high and my immunity level was low so i stopped off on my route along roosevelt ave for some light snacks sigh
the sushigods must love me an awesome meal at takesushi last weekend and now a stellar meal at kanoyama this weekend sighs contentedly if high quality sashimi werent so pricey id eat it every day my date and i went to kanoyama on a sunday night so there was no wait for a table kanoyama has very minimalistic ie almost nonexistent decor but the ambrosial seafood and attentive service more than made up for the lack in ambiencekanoyama has an extensive raw bar menu with types of oysters to choose from we decided to start with with two kumamoto oysters each the kumamoto oysters were on the sweeter side so they were divine when paired with the lightly tart ponzu sauce and a little an entree we shared the sashimi deluxe pieces each of kinds of the omakase sashimi pieces each of the days best kinds of to my delight the only overlap was the yellowtail the deluxe had all the standards that youd expect tuna salmon yellowtail fluke etc the omakase sashimi boasts of the best fish of the day and included red snapper kinki thornhead white tuna sockeye salmon and more that i cant remember the names of i was in sashimi heaven all were extremely fresh and i got to try some types of fish that ive never had before my favorite was the sockeye salmon which is a darker orange than regular salmon and is slightly more firm and slightly less fatty than regular salmon so delicious also interesting to note is that the white tuna we received in the omakase sashimi didnt look like the white tuna im used to it was pale pink as opposed to the pure white fish that i expected and the texture was fleshier than the spongy yet buttery white tuna id had in the past i did a little research on the topic and found that what kanoyama served is the true white tuna the opaque white fish that a lot of other restaurants serve as white tuna is actually another fish called escolarif you like wasabi i recommend getting an order of their fresh grated wasabi on the side to pair with your sushisashimi compared with the wasabi that usually comes with sushisashimi i found it to be sweeter with less of a bite but much more flavorful to fully appreciate the fresh wasabi i recommend spreading it directly onto your sushisashimi instead of mixing it into soy saucei was a little disappointed that neither the deluxe sashimi nor the omakase sashimi came with uni so we ended the meal with an addon order of uni sashimi like everything else we had the uni was extremely fresh the flavor was very clear and bold and it literally melted in my experience at kanoyama was outstanding and ill definitely be back thank you sushigodsfood for thought apparently there is a lot of controversy around escolar because while delicious and inexpensive consumption of large portions of escolar is bad for the gastrointestinal system escolar isnt banned in the us but the fda recommends only having escolar in portions smaller than oz

every so often ill start my reviews like many yelpers doi wanted to like this placewell actually i wanted not to like this place i say that mainly because im really not a huge fan of lobsterbut i know this is a quality place ive eaten here years ago when they first openedso even though i expected not to love this place i ended up loving it all over againare we thoroughly confused nowon snowy nights like this that nice calm warm feeling washes over you while so many people are out enjoying the city people are almost forced into slow motion something just makes you want to run home and watch reruns of taxithat sets the tone when you order your nice glass of pinot noirthis place isnt exactly cheap the market price of the lobster roll was priced at tonightlots of great and varied oysters not a wide selection of west coast though tonight which i usually prefernice friendly and prompt servicemy daily special appetizer of john antipasto for included baked clams shrimp scampi and peppers was absolutely amazing the clams had just enough breadcrumbs as to not make them gagging dry the shrimp were really just perfect and perfectly flavored and the thinly sliced peppers were salted to perfection see picsmy other daily special of penne w broccoli rabe a very nice offering of lobster meatballs over linguini i passed on but seemed intriguinganyway long story short the penne was undercooked and my waiter didnt charge me for thatit had good flavor a little salty just a hair spicy with what looked like a little bit of crushed red pepper and the broccoli rabe was very good with thinly sliced garlic cloves that would make pauly from goodfellas the movie proud overall the appetizer and the courtesy and professionalism of the staff was really what won me overi will be back
not all lan zhou hand pulled noodle shops are created equalperhaps it was by coincidence that a venture to lan zhou was conducted after all it was lunch hour and the technicians at lexus were nowhere close to done with the repair to my vehicle after wandering a few blocks on avenue i stumbled upon lan zhou and thought why not give it another shotsetting theres not much that can be said about the establishment the entire restaurant is a little smaller than square feet the seating area is limited to only about maybe generously individuals there is one large main table that can seat about to with other wall seating fitting about another to customers the restaurant itself is somewhat dingy nevertheless most holeinthewall type restaurants fall into this stereotype after all patrons that frequent noodle shops know that were here for the food not for the top notch decorthe foodbeef w hand pulled noodle compared to the lan zhou of east broadway section in chinatown the most notable observatory difference is that this location offers a larger serving of protein with about slices of beef weighing about to ounces patrons can be certain that this lan zhou wont be skimping on the ingredients the beef itself was on the firmer side but still possessing a proper balance of fat and carefully broken down connective tissue that made the beef enjoyable to consume as for the noodle brilliantly cooked and perfected each savory and scrumptious bite had with it the classic buttery smooth texture of the noodle while embodying a slight heartiness when chewed the noodles possessed a slightly doughy texture but certainly not one that was burdensome both elements combined to create a simplistic yet perfectly executed rendition of the classic hand pulled noodle is a slight price to pay for brilliance then again is a slight price paid for lunch compared to other notable establishmentsneedless to say i know where to go in brooklyn for a hand pulled noodle fixnotes on lan owners of this establishment speak prices range from to for a bowl of noodles with an order of dumplings youre still under restaurant itself is cramped the best seating is at the main table take the seat closets to the walls away from the dont spend more than minutes eating youre seat is being eyed by patrons looking to have cash only who pays for hand pulled noodles with plastic

besides the anne hathaway sighting yes she was getting a to go order with her boyfriend and adorable chocolate lab i think mile end deli is awesome at first i didnt understand the whole concept of a canadian jewish deli but darn was everything we had tasty started off with a bottle of the brut and the chopped liver and pletzel initially i didnt know what pletzel was but with liver you figure it must be some sort of bread it was a thick piece of bread like a cracker pita pretzel combo that was covered with sea salt the chopped liver i know im sure it sounds gross to most people was some of the best that ive ever had so flavorful and the consistency was solidi was tempted to get a to go order to take home between the of us we had a mishmash which was a lox scramble with onions and greens probably my least favorite it was just a bit too salty i actually tried to order the smoked meat hash which was brisket potatoes onion and fried egg but they were sold out boo the smoked meat sandwich was beef brisket on rye with mustard the lb of brisket i know tons was soooo tender and flavorful with plenty to share the ruth wilensky which was a salami sandwich pressed on an onion roll i did not try but it seemed to be devoured quickly basically i cant wait to go back and try everything on the menu

theres canada and then theres quebec quebec is an entirely different kettle of fish from anglophone canada far more european feel and outlook on life when i squeezed myself in through the foyer of the style metallic diner i heard the melodic sound of french being barked to the waiters saw the carefully executed dishes finished off on the counter and everyone working fast furiously but with a smile and elan i knew i would be in good handsm wells m is for magasin french for store is a diner but oh what a diner it is hugue dufour of the au pied de cochon fame in montreal and his wife sarah obraitis carefully renovated this place to retain all of the characteristic diner vibe of an open kitchen a long bar where you see the cooks slinging hash and some booths they did put in a long table at one end of the diner so they can accommodate parties larger than i arrived during sunday brunch prime time patrons were crammed in any free space there was available in the diner but the hostess quickly squeezed me in at the bar btw a coat rack is available in the vestibule off to the right end of the diner when you walk ini ordered the eggsausage breakfast sandwich and coffee i didnt have much expectation for the coffee but i was so wrong it was rich and strong and didnt turn into a sandy color the moment i put in a single drop of milk ah just how i wanted to start my sunday morning er afternoon i thought i made great egg english muffin sandwiches but m wells is out of this world epic first of the all the breakfast sausage is like no other sausage that ive ever had before im pretty sure they must make it pure porky goodness with a velvety smooth texture in between the texture of pork sausage and foie gras the sausage has a lovely sage overtone perfectly cooked silky smooth scrambled eggs that were draped over the breakfast sausage like a curtain the pickled jalapeno gave a spicy kick to the sandwich a slice of tomato and melted cheddar cheese inside the largest english muffin that ive ever seen this was a huge breakfast sandwich i loved itthe only quibbles that i have was that the menu didnt list mayonnaise as being in the sandwich which is a problem for me because i cant eat mayonnaise without getting really sick afterward so m wells please kindly fix your menu the texture of the english muffin was entirely too soft i would have preferred a crisper muffin so that way the sandwich had a crunchy aspect to it because otherwise everything was the same soft texture we need variety in our sandwich not only with ingredients but with texture too and not sure if the cheddar cheese added anything to the sandwich because i couldnt taste itstill this was absolutely amazing the sandwich was so big that i couldnt finish all of it even though i only had three or four bites left it was sooooo good that i couldnt bear the idea of leaving it behind so the waiter kindly wrapped it up for me yes it was that good a portion so small that i would have normally told them to discard it instead i squirreled it away to enjoy and savor at a later timem wells has all sorts of delicious things waiting for you to try for the culinary adventurous m wells has such delicacies such as pickled pork tongue sandwich crispy chicken skins and blood sausage hash if these things dont appeal to you dont worry they have more standard quebecoise fare like tourtiere meat pie and the thickest juiciest pork chops to tempt you withalthough traif and m wells are two entirely different styles both restaurants celebrate the glory that is the pig brooklyn may have traif but we have m wells
your favorite noodle place is probably some hole in the wall on a bustling chinatown street no frills kind of dingy fluorescent lighting the kind of place that doesnt invite lingering after your meal you let those things pass to sample a nice bowl of noodle soup for a mere few bucks well hung ry is not your favorite noodle place at least not yetnestled on bond st where expensive trendy food for good looking people make themselves home lies hung ry a modern yet humble establishment that is just a few months old whether you choose to sit on the church pews that line the wall or up at the bar to watch the chef thwack those noodles the owner and staff are quick to welcome you and proudly recommend some dishesappetizers are under and immediately show off the chefs creative executions and skills without sacrificing taste the squid appetizer was unexpected an evolved salt pepper squid of some sort complete with crispy squid rings and tentacles toasted pumpkin seeds and a killer guajillo chili paste youll want to mop up with the last bits of squid the short rib with daikon and shiso was also really good although the foam looked to be an aesthetic addition they could do without the flour used for the noodles is organic while the other ingredients are locally sourced if thats what matters to you needless to say the noodle soups from up to for their lobster offering are insanely delicious introducing updated flavors into the much loved asian comfort food the broth in my smoked pork belly noodle soup was rich without being too oily or heavy the broth had enough depth to compliment rather than compete with the smokiness from the silky pork belly and tongue roasted radishes and brussel sprouts my dining companions bowl of noodle soup with duck breastleg szechuan and roasted peppers was another treat generous tender pieces of duck swim in a rich broth with hints of spices that enhances the dish rather than overwhelm it the noodles whether you like them thick or thin are cooked perfectly a worthy vehicle to help slurp up that broththe owner was walking about throughout our stay checking in on us overseeing the dining room and taking drink orders we graced him with positive feedback that brought a warm smile to his face a confirmation to him that we will soon be returning to eat our way through the menuin a city where ramen is king in the higher end of the noodle spectrum and holeinthewall cheap noodle places reign supreme hung ry successfully stakes it claim in the market higher priced asian food is something i dont eagerly venture out to try and can be hard to swallow when cheap delicious options can be had all over the city however food of this quality and caliber are well deserving of the slightly higher premium especially since their bold fresh offerings pay homage to an asian staple while introducing something new for everyone to enjoydedicated to mohammad r for the heads up on hung ry and his drool worthy photos

ive long admired this enchanting little storybook row on atlantic avenue and happily i wandered into nunu seeking the solace of caffeine the woman who helped i believe she is the owner was kind enough after a bit of discussion of supersizing in america to make me a cortadito she asked me what it was and how to make it a cortadito is a wee cup of cuban coffee otherwise known as cafe con leche made with espresso its a bright and airy place and a peaceful place to recharge ones batteries i couldnt help but admire the kitchen the place of chocolate making magic i purchased an assortment of chocolates for my husband and as we know chocolate like most good things in life is best shared i emerged from nunu almost feeling like a nunuabout the chocolatesthankfully they are all made of dark chocolate why because justine likes working with dark chocolate we ate the caramel peanut and cashew blends they were perfect they were absolutely perfectthey also have wine and for those that are looking for south african wine you can find it hereaccording to the blurb on the chocolate box nunu is an affectionate nickname for little kids in africa where the owner spent her childhood
honestly who needs to go to new england to experience fresh amazing lobster when youve got red hook lobster pound in brooklyn not i that first bite of the maine style lobster sandwich made me feel in my bones that i was somewhere on the tip of the oceans in rockland enjoying the best catch of the day granted these were maine lobsters i was still transfixed the white bread is slightly toasted with some charring on the outside but soft like marshmellow when you bite into it along with that soft texture of the bread is the buttery and cool snap of the steamed lobster flesh tenderly dressed in mayo and other magical seasonings happening in these vats at rhlp paired with a crisp pickle a bag of cape cod chips and a bottle of lemon lime soda this was by far the highlight of my red hook food tourthe ctstyle roll is served warm with butter and no mayo i tried a bite of it but quickly realized that a cold lobster sandwich befits my palate a bit more another popular item here is their whoopie pie this chocolatelygoodness was the main draw for a couple friend of mine who decided to pass on the lobster but shared and dominated a whoopie pie i didnt try any as i was way too stuffed and needed room for the swingle experience that was to occur shortly after but it sure looked pretty damn goodthe lobster roll will set you back about with the drink but look at all the money youd be saving if you nixed that lobster trip to maine and just stick to good ol bk youd be having lobster sandwiches all summer long
now i dont speak spanish or anything but if i had to guess as to the meaning of superior in spanish id guess that it means the same thing as superior in english which i think we can all agree is something along the lines of awesomest based on that assumption i will say with absolute confidence that la superior is without question an appropriately named restaurantthe food is so good seriously it is so good i had a quado or what do you call a trio but with four of tacos and they were very delicious especially the tongue taco incredible texture if youve been thinking about trying tongue but have been a little apprehensive because well its tongue id say this is a good gateway tongue tongue an introduction to tongue for the complete novice the chipotle shrimp was in fact too spicy for me to eat but the more capsaicintolerant of my party were happy to oblige in return i got bites of torta fish quesadilla andbrainsyes they have brains here how much more normal did tongue just get the brains are wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried and the whole thing tastes kind of like a supercreamy crab rangoon very nice i wont lieas a neuroscientist i felt a little conflicted but i got over that pretty fastfinally these are probably the best margaritas ive had in the city no crappy sour mix herejust tequilla lime and maybe just a splash of simple syrup super fresh and not too sweet the way dios intended
blossom is arguably the best gourmet vegan restaurant in the city and i would gladly label the dinner at blossom a fivestar experience well i share their values and that surely plays a part in how i value their sharesthe setting at blossom is quite cozy and the space is fairly small the service is par for the course bordering on superfriendly and efficient the food depending on your choice and taste is consistently good and deserving of the price premiumif we had similar tastes it is difficult not to like the blackeyed pea cake starter potatoes and peas have not been put to better use or combined so effectively i have tried their seitan empanadas on occasion but prefer the sweet potato rolls and also the ravioli with pine nuts and cashew the entrees are equally pleasing notably the mezze plate and the pistachio and pepper dusted tofu i would recommend the chocolate ganache for dessert but would gladly try the blossom cheesecake except that i am not a fan of cheesecakeperhaps we were not all meant to be vegan or even vegetarian but if you are in the mood for vegan food you cannot go wrong with blossom

have you ever seen your boyfriend crymy darling manly lover got misty when he ate the lamb ribs those ribs were pungent with the animals rustic musk and covered in a redolent sweet spicy and sticky sauce my beaus eyes looked like two round unripened blueberries so pregnant with morning dew that they were about to fall off their grounding thin branches touched i took a bite and was instantly put into a carnal coma i couldnt move any body parts or feel anything besides the sensations in my mouth the lamb was so tender it made my teeth feel stronger fuck fluoride lamb ribs mmmmmm oh my my mouth is watering jabbathehut style reliving that moment another dish we got that was amazing was the beet cured salmon with rye bread and horseradish the beautiful deep beet color laced the edges of the salmon like wax on a bottle of makers mark the salmon was so fresh that the lean and fat of the fish tasted mutually exclusive and produced a creamy flavor when chewed slowly it was buttery and earthy from its beet treatment the horseradish was zesty and brought out the richness of the salmonanother incredibly intense dish we ordered was the pork belly the coddled egg on top was a beautiful shiny ivory satchel and the yolk was custardy and a bright canary yellow gingerly i kabobed a piece of egg with a chunk of pork and then speared into a leaf of purple radicchio the pork was slightly sweet and juicy like a sunsoaked grape the corners had a light caramelized crunch that was really pleasing the radicchio was not dressed and its bitter flavor complimented the pork and eggs unctuousness perfectly thats right the dish was perfectthe next night i ate there again my girlfriend a pastry chef at gordon ramsey was also floored by all of their disheswe got hamhock tots they were gooey balls of salty animal cheesey crispiness a really crowdsafe little dish the lamb crepenettes were up next and it they were little oblong spheres of lamb sausage they were flavorful and salty but nothing compared to the lamb ribs the rose we ordered went super well with this dish i think i drank a whole glass with itlastly but not least we got the pumpkin ice cream sandwich that ice cream was puddingstrength i mean it did not melt into a liquid mmmmm it was spicy the gingersnap cookies resting atop broke in a crumbly layered way that shortbread cookies would and were purposefully less sweeti crown thee street kitchen pretentiously just called kitchen on your awning the best damn restaurant in alphabet city

they have a huge selection of food here for a place that is meant for having your eyes checked walking in to confirm my appointment i was asked do i want anything to drink and were given the option of coffee hot tea cold tea water soda and beer beerdid they just say beer imagine that see if your optometrist would give that to you no well then you are patronizing the wrong place apparently to help wash it down they have a whole snack area towards the back feeling like being healthy today granola bars fruits and rice crackers are available hell with the healthy eating and want to just scarf anything down cookies candies fresh popcorn with flavored seasonings and movie theater styled butter available to top it off etc are there also for the taking the popcorn is sooo goo wait what its supposed to be a review of an optometrists place not a food review opps sorry force of habit when it comes to yelp and food for melet me restarti usually rate the process of getting my eyes checked only slightly above having my teeth pulled i normally grit my teeth walk in get bored to death while waiting for my turn at that torture machine that puffs air straight into your eyeball all that just to walk away a few hours later with the happy news that my eye sight is getting ever slightly worseat park slope eye they did what they could to make the experience as pleasant as they could for everyone they provide a laptop with internet access in the waiting area to help pass the time if you are not interested in reading the usual magazines found at other places there are toys to help distract the customers children while they are waiting since this is park slope we are talking about i imagine these toys are being used a lot there is even a lot of foo you have heard enough about the food already ok ok skipping it im continuing the review sheeshthe machines are much more modern than the places that ive previously checked my eyes at in the past like pearl vision and cohens optical that torture machine i talked about the one that puffs air unpleasantly straight into your eyeball they replaced that one here with something newer that is less invasive and only looks into your eye that itself is almost worth having my eyes checked here instead boy do i hate that air puff machine i wish i knew whats it called i sound so stupid calling it the air puffing machine but im currently too lazy to google the proper name i even received a digital photo by mail of the inside of my pupils i was told it was to see how healthy my blood vessels were how my optic nerve was doing and if there is a possible chance that something is amiss and could lead to some form of eye cancer this is something new to me at these placesthe whole process of having my eyes checked was fast and efficient although i use contacts most of the time i could see through browsing the store that they have a good selection of glasses to choose fromthe staff is incredibly friendly and patient i saw them taking the time to explain in detail the copay options for a particular patients benefits justin b one of the eye doctors at the place and fellow yelper to boot is very easy to talk to and acts more like your friend than your doctor friendly banter seems to be the norm with his patients here in the end this has been the best experience having my eyes checked anywhere and its hard to imagine going back to any place else after thisps as of this review if you are a fellow yelper and i assume there is a good possibility that you are if you are reading this review park slope eye has an offer of a gift card for new customers

rincon criollo reminds me of the character mustafa in the austin powers movies who survives repeated attempts to eliminate him by dr evil the most memorable scene being story goes that the acosta brothers were forced out of their beautiful beachside restaurant in havana by gunwielding soldiers fleeing to the us they survived through odd jobs till one day they ran into an old friend from cuba who helped them reopen their restaurant in queensi looked at the plaque on the wall honoring their years in business as i commented on their silver jubilee my puerto rican friend excitedly corrected me that the award itself was given in and so they should be celebrating their golden jubilee soon one look at the dignified demeanor of one of the brothers whom we recognized from the picture on the wall inspired me to read as much as i could to learn about his storyi am from miami so i know good cuban food well not really but you dont need to go to miami to enjoy great cuban food rincon criollo would stand up to the very best in the cuisine i have no credentials to say this other than repeated consumption at restaurants like havana alma caf√© habana sophies tinas victor etc all notable in their own right but pedestrian in comparison to rincon criolloyou may think that youve had great ropa vieja well rincon criollo will make you think again my puerto rican friend who always gets ropa vieja any time we eat cuban swore that this was the best shed had i do not have as much experience but the meat cooked like shredded rags has a tenderness of texture and boldness of tomato flavor that would make one weep with joy at the perfection of its executionthe pounded chicken breast chicken rincon criollo cooked with onions and garlic is simple and tasty as is the chicharron de pollo that would put any fried chicken to shame the twice fried plantains tostonespatacones are crisp and golden brown though surprisingly not oily and the cuban black beans are also the best ive ever hadi havent been able to try their much touted milkshakes but i really really love the coconut caramel flan another best in class perhaps the densest flan ive ever had and lip smacking good by habit i ordered the dulce de leche on my next visit but the curdle milk dessert was different from any ive ever experienced or indeed expected much too rich even for a sweet tooth like me still something completely unique that merits at least a try i would stick with the flan for my next visit thoughcastro may have wished to shoot this storys climax fifty years back but all he succeeded in doing was giving nycs cuban cuisine a shot in the arm you may go to rincon criollo to witness yet another affirmation of the triumph of human spirit over obstacles or you may go to try food at its very best simple and tasty as an infidel who believes that every one must get his just desserts i go for all three reasons ropa vieja cuban black beans and coconut flan
the right components the right texture the surprising factor and the exotic side that belongs to a underrepresented cuisine as moroccan is evoked so much pleasure with each bite that i will remember the word zaalouk for long time zaalouk are roasted eggplant slices with olive oil and garlic tomato arugula and balsamic vinegar hot in texture as is tender to the melting point but served cold a touch of sweetness a touch of exoticism i also loved their briouats this small pockets are made with pastry dough in a triangular shape and filled with pieces of chicken tender and tasty that preserves the meat flavor but that have incorporate the sweetness and spiciness of the rest of elements including ginger cinnamon saffron and almonds and maybe others sweet at first bite tasty with the following the dough was soft without missing firmness and flavorful by itself and not because the powder sugar that lightly covers each piece but because the way is madewell i think they really use the special moroccan pastry dough for this dish call warga because i couldnt identify it as phyllo which seems to be the alternative optioni didnt know that there was a previous location for babouche at soho closed now and that frank bruni didnt like it at all if the second chances that he was asking for babouche have allowed to reach this level at the current brooklyn location then ill have to thank him not only for the enjoyment of reading his reviews with the same name same owner and same concept and references im assuming we are talking about the same place maybe you know this and you can tell me for sure but regardless and besides what the original restaurant barb√®s the manhattan brother is offering i think babouche represents authentic flavors using high quality ingredients wrapped in a clean and exotic look but dressed in elegance add an excellent service large food and drink menus reasonable prices and seems clear that they known the formula for a five starswe order many dishes as we were a large group and everything was just delicious but the moules a la marocaine or moroccan style mussels deserve to be mentioned served hot inside the earthenware were seems to be cook just in the last minute with the steam the sauce a mixture of tomato crushed pepper garlic and cilantro was light in texture but full of flavor and a bit spicy if you taste moroccan food you know you have to try couscous and tagine at some point we had the couscous aux legumes vegetables couscous marocaine traditional with lamb and tagine de legumes served in their corresponding earthenware as well the presentation is beautiful the taste was excellent and the texture perfect fluffy couscous tender but firm at the same time and colorful vegetables sign of the perfect steamed cooking tasty and not watery at all the flavors remind me what i had at tunisia a few years ago although the two countries make different versions for both dishes i think the couscous should be more tasty even spicier by itself but mixing it up with the vegetables you really dont miss flavor at all shiraz and malbec were the wines that we choose among a large list of different countries both were excellent and i highly recommend it but the classic pinots cabernet or chardonnays are offered as well beer and champagnes are also an option pita bread was continuously coming warm to our table a party of complete only after the dinner started yes my party for wasnt ideal ok it was terrible as only half was there after our reservation time when we start ordering but complains any rush any bad faces or attitude any the experience was complete after the show of a belly dancer that interact with the patrons and can even choose your girls to dance with her when they are part of a group this seems to happen every saturday the cost in total every city in morocco has a special pull casablanca is known for its hospitality and warmth tangier for its cuisine and culture marrakesh for entertainment and fez is linked to the past and to its french rootsthis is what barbouche claim in their site to represent and to me it is certainly true we didnt miss any of them at all
this place is so legit i saw an italianamerican guy walk in wearing a gold braceletand a tracksuit yes a tracksuit i was also reminded of that scene in the office where michael tried ordering the gabagool like michael i wanted to ask for the gabagool alas it wasnt on the menu hahathe interior is very cute it has that oldworld feel to it but everything is in good conditioni ordered the meatball parm heroand it was love at first sight i could tell this was gonna be the best meatball parm ive ever had and i was right giant delicious balls with melted cheese on top you had to eat this guy with a fork and knife oh and manhattan special on tap i never had a coffeeflavored soda but damn it was goodbonus points for knowledgeable soccer guys frank the owner is a diehard milan fan and jimmy the cook was from ecuador so i ended up talking to them for an hour after my meal haha and their espresso is classically goodjust like the ones youd get in italy ill definitely be back to kill my meatball hero cravingwhich is often
this place is overwhelmingly packed with covetable things for folks who cook and entertain at home the aisles are so narrow that patrons are forced to play human tetris where one person recedes into a nook before the other can settle in to look at the glass tumblers and cocktail accoutrements somehow it works but im still amazed that i didnt maul a display with my grocery tote at any rate if you ever want to surprise me my preferred colors are teal and lime and im partial to le creuset even though i didnt see any in those colors i think the lime is called lemongrass and is only available through williams sonoma sightarzian also stocks sodastream carbonators in both sizes thats what brought me in you get off for turning in an empty carbonator of either size and sodastream has increased the capacity of the larger carbonators from to sweet so for i have one canister thats the equivalent of liter bottles of soda water thats a lot of stuff that i dont have to carry up my stairs nice helpful staff and innovative too they have walkie talkies to prevent themselves from having to play that slow game of peopletetris with customers

if ever i were to promote a dictatorship and if ever i would elect a dictator to run this dictatorship minetta tavern would be the place and francois would be the man we arrived at on a sunday night to find there was a minute wait for seats at the bar happily plopped down by francois read us our specials and then gave us a minute to decide on what we would eat as he mentioned the baby pig special my eyes and mouth started to water and he gave me a smile and a nod that yes indeed it is that good but i was there for one reason and one reason only the black label burger i couldnt let myself be swayed it was my one reason for going there and i could not leave without having tried it our order bone marrowoxtail and foie gras black label burgers one med rare one medwe asked if we could put cheese on the burgers francois shook his head no not if this is your first time fair enough we thought as we both tried to remember the last time we had a burger without cheese we started off with the bone marrow best bone marrow ive had huge pieces of bone sliced in half comes with toasted baguette slices and a shallot confit that was the absolute perfect match for the creamy rich marrow i think this mightve been the best thing we ate that day the oxtail and foie gras terrine while good was probably a bit too rich for me especially right after the bone marrow and because the marrow was so delicious this just could not stand up to the test of taste skipthen came our burgers yes this was the best burger ive had yet francois did not let us put anything on the burger for the first bite no ketchup no mustard no lettuce no tomato no nothing just meat bun bite it was absolutely delicious perfectly cooked and seasoned incredibly tender and soft so good we decided to continue eating it without any condiments or accoutrements we took a suggestion from our friendly neighbors at the bar and ordered glasses of the zinfandel francois zins please i yelled loudly enough so he could hear me he smiled and began to open a bottle francois is that zin he smiled again no it wasnt but the way that wine went perfectly with our burgers we didnt care eh what do we know anyway for dessert we were told to order the grand marnier souffle again delicious some people dont like being told what to do but when what you are being told to do is the best advice you could be given why arguelong live francois long live minetta tavern
i think i am in love like real love well about as real as it can get when it comes to loving a bakery i love everything about two little red hens the fact that its so tiny how adorable it is the friendly staff the beautifully decorated cakes the delicious cupcakes i mean whats not to lovethe red velvet is by far the best ive ever tasted the cake is moist fluffy and i swear you can taste the love and effort that went into baking that cupcakecake and the cream cheese frosting my goodness its so light creamy and freaking delicious excuse me for sounding disgusting but i could probably eat a whole tub of it after i devoured my red velvet cupcake an image of me sitting in front of a huge red velvet cake from two little red hens flashed into my mind and i wished that i had bought a large cake insteadi dont often venture up to the ues but its become obvious that i must now find more excuses to go to st in the words of liz lemon i want to go to there
sipping a brooklyn lager at this harlem watering hole i made a mental note to myself that not everything cool about nyc resides downtown the shrine is a gem decorated with old records african tribal art and paintings by local harlem arists the shrine feels like a true neighborhood joint very friendly service great small tables up front a cool bar scene lots of elbow room and live music most nights plus anyplace that pays homage to bob marley and peter tosh is aok in my book
this place was formerly the rispoli pastry shop until three weeks ago peggys burger house opened up this place is really bright bright like highlighter orange there are a few tables in the front and theres a bigger dining area towards the back since this is a corner shop theres plenty of sunlight coming in through the glass from all over making this place even brighter any brighter i would need to wear sunglasses but i like bright so no complaints i ordered an order of buffalo wings a california dream smoothie the peggys burger deluxe which comes with either fries onion rings or curly fries i ordered the pizza burger for my sister plus there are free burger toppings that includes inhales lettuce tomatoes relish onion grilled onions grilled mushrooms pickles jalapeno peppers green peppers mayo ketchup mustard suace bbq sauce and hot sauce exhales the food took minutes to make which was kind of long for just burgers and onion ringscurly friesthe buffalo wings were pretty good the meat melts right off the bones it was more sour than it was spicy but it was still pretty good peggys burger was really really really good the burger was very moist topped with bacon cheese and chili on the menu it states that their burgers were never frozen so i guess thats why the burger was so moist the onion rings were really good too the pizza burger has mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce which was good i still feel peggys burger was way better the curly fries were a bit on the soggy end overall the food here is yummy i will come back here to try other foods on their menu they do not only serve burgers they also have homemade soup hotdogs sandwiches fried chicken salad juices and ice cream i think shake shack and peggys burger should have their own throw down with their burgersokay maybe shake shack will win but still its really really scrumptious okay so after this meal i think i will need to bump up my training for jogging even earliersigh but yay for good food
in the months that ive been mia from yelp ive done the following gone to three weddings trekked to the other side of the world ie australianz and had my fair share of koalas licorice and ahem men window shopping obvi tolerated i mean enjoyed every minute of my mothers thanksgiving visit had cavities filled and a bonding done lost two fans and ya know generally tried to stay true to my baller shot caller twentyinch blade on the impala waysas for the last item youre probably thinking riiigggghhhhttttand id pretty much agree with you except i went to sunitas for hermanos thirty and dirrrty birthday party and it was a statuschanger wait a lifechangersunita is everything youd expect shes cute petite impeccably maintained owns the same ikea lounge chairs that i have most importantly she actually has a cocktail list where id be more than obliged to take a sip out of each creation shes also empty on a saturday night which was key because our lil group of was loud and just wanted to throw our stuff in a corner and not worry about anyone jacking it sorry but mama needs two hands to enjoy her cocktail examples include the passion fruit jalapeno martini elderflower gin and this red thing with rye sunita also popped our absinthe cherry and didnt pass judgment as nine year olds and one charming year old me watched her entranced devise the licoricetasting concoction i guess as you approach your youve gotta work that much harder to stay relevant kudos to the snarky yelper who told me that via gchat you know who you are sars
the meatball shop was one of the highlights of my food life ive been talking with friends about going here for months and finally made it with jade n friday night yep ive had the balls arriving at this place was packed i put my name down for two and stepped outside by the time jade arrived they were ready to seat us in minutes theres usually a wait and they originally told us it would be we were seated in less than awesomethis was my first time at the meatball shop and i found the way the menu works interesting laminated you take one of their nifty makers check the pics and mark what you want front and back be sure not to miss the desserts luscious ice cream paired with chocolate chip brownie gingersnap peanut butter or macaroon cookies mmm yum dont forget to check the specials menu ball of the day licks lips salad sides and ice cream our waitress approached us after a few minutes and since jade had already been there we were ready to order pretty fast especially me being a rookie i opted for sliders and a side of mashed potatoes jade opted for the balls al a carte after about minutes of waiting and making idle chit chat with our italian neighbors our waitress apologetically told us our food would be out shortly embarrassed by the amount of time it took to serve us a very attractive server maybe restaurant manager came over to us to apologize for taking so long and put dessert on the house and offered us drinks gratis we passed on the sangria since jade doesnt drink and i dont really either except for a nice wine or some shots and opted for their summer berry lemonade yum jade and i were both very impressed we hadnt even complained that our food was taking so long out loud anyway each meatball slider was quite delicious but my favorite was the spicy pork dont let the word spicy deter you its more of a pleasant kick that makes you go ooo the mashed potatoes were heavenly coming from me thats an uber compliment considering my aunt makes the best mashed potatoes on earth southern style recipe passed down from my uncles relatives who were slaves these were comparably delicious creamybuttery topped with chives small pieces of scalloped potatoes i practically licked my plate cleannext up our free dessert delicious homemade ice cream packed between two delectable cookies i opted for vanilla with chocolate chip and jade for strawberry with ginger snap both were drool worthy and we finished them up loving every bitenow since i had been really excited to go to this place my boyfriend wanted me to bring him a treat to try meatball sammie he asked for so when our dessert came our waitress put in my order for a meatball smash with provolone for my man this time our order was ready quickly and she neatly placed the bag on the back of my chair to take when we left an fyi if you want to do takeout too they dont do sliders everything else is fair game now for my signature part of the review the bathroom hidden behind a thick dark wooden door with just a simple rooster plate on the front the bathroom is actually really nice decorated with an old time summer countryside feel the bathroom smells fresh accessorized with a large wooden table large pedestal sink and a toto toiled info courtesy of jade n the bathroom is actually inviting and lends positively to the dining experience interested in what it looks like check out my pics ive already been planning to come back with a few friends after some les rooftop fun before bruno mars this month but after our nice experience here and the staffs attentiveness to our lengthy wait for food telling us they hoped it didnt deter us from visiting again ill definitely be back hopefully sooner than mid august
for healthy oats eating people this place is probably their worst nightmare but for us meat freaks its the equivalent of babeland but with meat sickbut even for meat lovers the idea of a butcher shop isnt the most tantalizing surprisingly enough espositos doesnt reek of animal flesh and youd think butchers would be tough and surly men the types that were feared in elementary school just for being large but these guys are slender and polite and they smile whati came in and got a quarter pound of domestic prosciutto a pound of mozzarella i literally said one ball of mozzarella please a pound of spicy italian sausage and a porkchop it was all wrapped up neatly and quickly and my total was less than that would buy me items at food emporium and they take cash as well as credit card hereas soon as i got home i dug into the mozzarella and prosciutto and man was it good so fresh i swear its calorie free the next day i cooked up the sausage the sausage the sausage spicy and so plump like its bursting from its casings i was home all alone and stuck a fork into one and ate it like a lollipop i started with getting the basics from espositos but i hope to progress onto braver things one of my favorite dishes is fried chicken gizzards and im determined to cook them myself one day i had a long stare down with the gizzards when i was in the shop trying to build up the courage to buy them i actually have to touch those things and i lost but one day im taking those gizzards to schoolespositos is quintessential noo yawk its the butcher shop we go to on stop of grocery shopping day after stop fresh produce and before stop baked goods nothing makes me feel more like a true new yorker than being able to say i godda butcha guy
bartender did the hornet knock the wind out of youme yea it was pretty strong my clever compadre you got stungon a cold chilly night i darted down a side street and quietly entered this dark unassuming beautiful cozy bar exposed brick gold wallpaper antiques and a small jukebox add just the right touch of intimacy and secrecyi started off with a hornet which is made with tequila campari grapefruit juice splash of grenadine although strong the way i like it i i would have preferred this with gin after this i swtiched to beer a safer bet as i didnt want to get sloppy everyone at the bar was superfriendly chatty and acting in concordance with the brooklyn bill of rightsi will definitely be back to enjoy some brews and friendly company fyi they are currently not serving food no empanadas here that was disappointing they were getting their empanadas from bogota they are waiting for a health inspection and then perhaps will serve food again but they have a myriad of menus to order takeout note mon and tues off drinks wedsun off drinks this excludes nonalcoholic brooklyn bill of rights when in brooklyn do as the brooklynites do
this has been and still is my favorite place in ktown if i had a choice id probably not go anywhere else i dont like the throngs of korean yuppies in floor with the pseudo models hanging or pretending to hang on their every word or the mixed crowd of yuppies in players who think theyre being cultured by being in a korean sports bar dont get me wrong baden isnt without its flaws the random signage hanging on the walls is reminiscent of an applebees but to throw this feeling off they dress their waitstaff in black dress clothes and black vests like theyre catering at a gothic wedding regardless its unpretentious and most days you can actually hear what the people youre with have to say their nakji bokkeum octopus stirfry is what i come back for every so often its delicious and spicy not for those who have low spiciness threshold and chewy and filled with noodles i will warn you that the kind of noodles you will get arent consistent sometimes theyre udon and sometimes its the angel hair noodles if you have a preference ask for it nonetheless when its drenched in the red sauce its all deliciousi would like to take a little more time to address some of the previous chicken comments this place does not serve korean fried chicken kfc nor does it claim to it claims to serve tong dak which means whole chicken i think they just meant rotisserie chicken and before bonchon came and started frying the critters this was the golden standard of korean chicken random nostalgic moment before i had to worry about weight gain my girlfriend and i used to come to drink a pitcher of beer each and eat a whole chicken and nakji bokkeum and we cleaned house yo
if youre in a rush dont come to radiance if youre starving dont come to radiance if youre loud annoying or drunk dont come to radiance if youre looking for an intimate romantic location dont come to radiance otherwise radiance should more or less end up being a wonderful experience after a lovely show at city center the bf and i crossed the street and were surprised to find a teahouse that was still open past not really in the mood for alcohol we decided to stop in for some tea the place is onehalf book store onehalf tables it really does feel like a bookshop cafe except instead of cramming in as many tables as possible they make it a priority to not crowd anyone the place is maybe just a little too brightlylit they arent really shooting for any ambiance but just a very casual welcome friendly setting not exactly romantic but still a good place for couples and groups alikewaitstaff is so friendly when we came there were only two waiters it should have been enough for such a small space but they seemed overworked everyones food came out slow which can be frustrating so dont come if you are in a rush we ordered two pots of tea and their selection of chinese teas is excellent we were offered a rebrew but declined presentation is very cute our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable if arguably a little too energetic it almost made me tired talking to him but ultimately he helped make the experience memorable you dont often meet someone as friendly or genuine as him and he greets you with a smile and warmth that begins as soon as you step in it helps that hes also super passionate about tea and everything on the menuthe food was delicious mochi is very small but so fresh and soft the mochi ice cream is nothing special but i absolutely loved the dumplings particularly the woodear mushrooms which are served with a delicious house made sauce the cost quickly adds up when you taste a variety of teas and small plates here but we were not disappointed quality ingredients and very delicate flavors made me a fan if youre not in the mood for a pot of hot tea dont be afraid to venture to their iced teas their sweetened moroccan mint is one of my summer staples and totally worth it it helps that it comes with a bendy straw toowill definitely return even if it can be pricey its perfect for a slow afternoon or maybe a late night excursion a very casual place with far from casual food and drinks
getting a meal as a gift is about the food and the experience i had heard a lot about momofuku and just about all of it is true it is a small space that remains crowded the size of the restaurant is underlined by small tables flanked by chairs without backs may be more than youre hoping to spend on noodle soup it all sounds so negative and youd think id only give it four stars because of that but for the food the pork buns are amazing with pork butt folded into some of the softest dough ever with spicy and crunchy cucumbers the noodles in your ramen will kick your maruchan saltinapacket lunch out the window but then theres the chicken ive eaten whats considered some of the best fried chicken in the country guss of memphis and was wary of the fried chicken here i went with an open mind and mouth and was so pleasantly surprised when you order the chicken dinner you get two chickens fried two different ways korean and southern buttermilk the latter being the favorite of our table i cant and wont compare or will at least try not to as there is room for both especially since theyre in different states the chicken was so moist so flavorful so hot so so yes it is accompanied with pancakes should you want to eat it moo shu style and a variety of sauces skip the hoisin and sriacha and go straight to the jalapeno garlic or chives and whatever that was frankly i thought all of that got in the way so i didnt even bother i did contemplate going around the corner to the milk bar to try the soft serve since they have more flavors there but finishing a christmas present with candy canemocha ice cream covered in chocolate chip cookie crumbs seemed like the best ideamy advice would be to bring a bunch of friends who also love good fried chicken and chow down if you do it right you can finish the whole plate there were five of us and with pork buns ramen and potatoes there were only four pieces of chicken left
on a cold winter night a birthday needed celebration four friends gathered at east side company bar only to see a froststained board saying we are closed for renovation meet us at white star on essex st the four friends shiverjaunted down two barren blocks wondering whether the white star would indeed guide them to a happier place white star was dark sceney and intimate we were four of twelve patrons scattered around the dimly lit bar with a few more cosying up in the wooden booths along the old brick wall we warmed up in an alcove by the entrance and then the night beganfor the next four and a half hours patrons came and went but we stayed from dark and stormys to beez neez to stawberry and bourbon concoctions to anything with tequila to anything with gin to trappist beers the liquor went down as the conversation did smooth and effortless among a myriad of subjects we talked about a weird acquaintance we suspect could be god pans labyrinth business school mania sharks and the realistic chance that there could be a fight club operating in a chinatown basement time just flew by as if we were sitting in a living room on a lazy sunday afternoon thats when i knew that white star was the beez neez we ended up having a thirty minute conversation with the bartendermixologist kelvin and the manager both of whom are new york natives shouldve known no outsider can make you feel so much at home in the city turns out kelvin also works at milk n honey on mondaytuesday nights he just told us to text him for a reservation and sign off as them from white star wordwhite star is the perfect place for spending quality time with quality friends over some quality cocktails on a quality gals birthday
this place hardly needs any more positive reviews but it is what it is the most fun way to exercise i have ever encountered turns out climbing is very addictive you go once to try it out and next thing you know you have a membership own climbing gear and say things like belay on weird anyway the place is enormous and awesome and everyone should try it they keep changing the routes so you never get bored also im very excited because theyre starting to do yoga and pilates classes most conveniently of all theyre open really late til on weekdays and later on weekends so you have plenty of time to get home drop your stuff and head over to the gym
little known fact sanpanino actually stands for st panini the patron saint of sandwiches really its true every time you go here you should call your grandmother tell her you went to church and though she will still think youre a dirty little slut for living with your boyfriend in sin shell at least think youre repenting not that i would know anything about that focaccia communion tomayto tomahtoooh and speaking of tomatoes this stuff is fresh from the roasted peppers to the mozzarella to the incredible bread to the mouthwateringly flavorful balsamic vinegar quality is what makes this one of the best sandwiches ive ever tasted seating is limited but if you want to have a perfect new york moment grab a sanclassico a lemonade and take it down to the hudson river park just a quick walk away sanpanino i bless you il nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti im so going to hell
while i appreciate the diversity it surprises me that in brooklyn which has a large african american population there is a dearth of good soul food spots i mean i love jerk chicken as much as the next guy but whats a brotha gotta do to get some smothered pork chops in the past it meant crashing predominately black churches luncheonsreverend brother james have you finally found the lord me is he here i just found the turkey wings and greens ill keep an eye outstrangely my humor wasnt appreciatedthankfully fosters makes excellent reasonably priced soul food the smothered pork chops i raved about when it was called ruthies is still fantastic other standouts are the fried whiting nicely seasoned and not overly breaded the smothered turkey wings not available everyday and the sides the mac cheese deserves mention because it one of the best ive had outside of my family or black churches i prefer a solid cheesy baked mac cheese as opposed to the more liquidy kind and fosters deliversthe sweet tea was also perfect probably the best ive had outside of nola i had the fried chicken once a while ago and thought it was just okay it may have been an off day since it seems to be the most popular order the times ive eaten here the portion sizes are huge considering dinners range from low to midteens lunch is always a good price to portion ratio and is less crowdedthe dining space is clean and nicely decorated but small id guess they can maybe seat people max come solo or as a couple a group would be hard at dinner easier at lunch timein addition to bringing southern food they bring southern hospitality too from inquiring about regular customers families to welcoming newcomers to politely handling rude diners the ladies here are wonderful its not perfect but the price quality and friendliness makes fosters one of my favorite places to eat currently no credit cards and closed sunday monday to clear any confusion fosters is the same restaurant as ruthies the matriarch passed away and they changed the name the family still runs it and the food is still the same
i first went to yasuda when visiting new york at the end of fresh from a trip to japan it evoked memories of eating breakfast at tsukiji long wooden counters consummate skill and incredible quality for the next eighteen months i was lost in an uni wonderland the love affair that started that night still consumes me this very day last night i made a long awaited return as a first date venue it can be a little intimidating and i immediately wondered if i had made the right choice but the warm reception from our counter chef and occasional but not imposing banter soon allayed those fears we decided against the omakase i have had it before but like the freedom and flow of the meal when ordering piece by piece for me the jewel of the crown was undoubtedly the uni rather than have this straight away we had a few palate warmers monkfish liver and japanese pickles the liver was served as three slivers in a yuzu and daikon dressing it was creamy but my date loved it more than i so we swapped and i devoured the pickles my number one vicenext was the sushi for which we regularly turned to our chef for advice and ate in pairsyellow tail mild and sweetfatty tuna warm and deep in colouruni alaskan and mayne the alaskan was beautiful brighter in colour than the mayne and incredibly sweet oyster and japanese mackeral the oyster was creamy soft and incredibly fresh melting upon the tongue the mackeral was clean and sweet defying the oily nature of the mackeral family hamachi farmed and wild one variety was known as the bully fish due to its size sea scallop delicious lightly dusted with sea salt my date had the cheek to tell the chef that she found it a little salty and could without the salt he took it well toro roll the finest roll i have had the pleasure of eating diced fatty tuna surrounded by a rare high quality seaweed that is only available by auction simply divine a must havethe size of each piece is perfect according to the website yasuda assesses the size of ones mouth to ensure the size will be just right the ratio of fish to rice is also delicately measured the thin sliver of fish complimenting the small bundle of rice what is immediately apparent is the quality of the rice warm and fluffy the balance of salt sugar and vinegar in perfect harmony i wont rehash what has been clearly articulated many times before but it is due to the types of rice sea salt and brown vinegar that they use the brown vinegar is naturally sweeter and softer in flavour than the white counterpart allowing them to use less sugar i once watched a cooking show where the chef defined the perfect risotto as one where each grain of rice retained its sense of individuality a little wanky but i loved that line and preceded to make it my own and the defining virtue by which i made risotto now i feel that in yasuda it has a more worthy recipient and in my mind i play out scenes where yasuda is a general surveying a battlefield with millions of grains of rice each with its own clear set of instructions such is the mastery that they have over their rice believe the hype make a reservation and let yourself gobilling notesat around per piece it can add up but the sake is reasonably priced expect to pay around per headimportant notescounter service bookings are for minutes only be sure to specify that you would like to sit at the counter when making the bookingif possible get a counter booking with yasuda himself or the funny and factual old guy right at the endcounter bookings are only kept for minutes so dont be latethe shoyusoy sauce is a trap use it without instruction and be shunned for the rest of the night likewise the wasabilikewise the pickled ginger isnt a party snack eat sparingly and only when you really need to cleanse your palatewhen the sushi is placed on the wood board do not get lost in idle conversation and delay eating the rice will go cold and harden and the chef will sigh and shake his headlastly for the feminists out there do not ask why there are no women working behind the sushi counter i wisely stayed out of that conversation
manny the head masseuse at the setai has magic healing hands this review for the setai spa is long overdue ive visited several times and after much consideration this is officially my favorite spa in nyc its a luxurious experience from start to finish you exit the elevator on the third floor and are greeted by a peaceful candlelit hallway to your left is the front desk the friendly staff will then wisk you away to where theres a lavishly designed jacuzzi steam room and sauna as well as lockers robes and slippers everything you would expect from your typical highend spa experience if theres time before andor after your massage or treatment you can enjoy the amenities alternatively you can choose to wait for your therapist in the setai spas tranquil tea room they usually offer you some champagne and there are truffle chocolates nuts and cookiescrackers to snack on while you waiti highly recommend requesting manny whom i mentioned above once in his capable hands you will feel all of your pains and stresses melt away i have lots of trouble with my back and neck as i used to be a professional wrestler which i now compare to earning a living as a human crash test dummy i ended up with a very bad injury which required me to have to get a twolevel fusion neck surgery my back and neck have felt a lot better since my operation but unfortunately whenever i travel on long flights it ends up aggravating my old injury recently ive been going back and forth to visit my friends and family in california a lot and its been taking a toll on me as a result i was left with no other choice but to pay manny another visit its expensive but it is worth it hes my equivalent of visiting a doctor because hes the only one that can fix me up so that i can live to fight another day while hes stretching and kneading the kinks out of me i can feel and hear my joints slip back to where they are supposed to be his technique is a less invasive approach to visiting a chiropractor i wouldnt describe it to be anything like the jarring and cracking of an adjustment but more so like a gentle nudge to put everything in its rightful spot i was advised not to see chiropractors after my injury but ive entrusted my spine to manny and hes never done me any wrong i cannot say enough nice things about him go pay him a visit when you have a chance take a deep breath relax and enjoy
a line of taxi cabs forms a fortress in front of new ivoire a line that stretches down the block and gets even larger as day turns to night and midnight hungers need to be fixed this joint is obviously popular with the west african cab drivers in the city and i would definitely rather see them sitting here having friendly conversations instead of avoiding them on the street while bikingthey sat around large tables alternating their attention between the food the rambunctious conversations and the soccer channel on television the owner would sit with them at times giving the place a very friendly local feel as newcomers we did not stand out at all though even if my spotty french was not quite enough at times to describe what i wantedat lunch the restaurant has a rotating menu of three or more items different on each day the following two items were available on mondays the sauce arachide was very similar to other west african mafes but had a more subtle approach to its peanut sauce allowing other flavors to surface and creating a splendid soup for its beef served with a heaping plate of rice the dish is definitely more than necessary for lunchanother choice for the sides was a plate of yuca that appeared in couscous form the owner recommended it with the second dish the sauce claire dindon and was spot on its a soup with turkey and tomato but spiced with pepper and very oily both dishes brought back great west african memories with a small colorful pepper in the centeri also grabbed what appeared to be a homemade lemonade and expected it to be infused with something sickeningly sweet like vanilla what i found though was in addition to this insulting sweetness a strong burning ginger was in there which i could not finish despite the great taste
um well yes i uhthere are no words how do you find one adjective that tells everyone how you feel about tacos unlike anything you have ever tasted you cant you cant find one because not one single word exists for something so simple and savory that magical tacomaking elves are probably in the kitchen constructing and grilling and seasoning your tacos while you wait there salivating like a rabid dogsometimes i sit at work and all i can think about are these damn all consuming tacos they are making me unproductive and my biggest concern is losing my job and im not worried about having money for rent i need to have the money for tacos i will live on the street and eat these tacos and that will suffice as a lifestyle i will sacrifice all for the small corn tortillas and perfectly roasted shrimp alongside the gorditas that will change your life you want me to wait an hour for delivery you want me to wait minutes for a table that is not a problem i will sit here quietly and envision the tacos arriving in front of me and devouring every single last flavorful bean that image will keep me warm until i get the real thing its an obsession so great i have eaten there at least twice a week and usually more since i discovered this tiny taqueria three weeks ago so um yeah there are no words
i heart faustina and i hate it when people heart anything but my dinner at faustina was great and so i heart the placeeven though we booked a table we ended up having a great meal at the bar at a very good looking barthe staff is very friendly knowledgeable and attentive mr conant is there making his rounds making sure everything is going well very nice we had the prosciutto san daniele pecorino and the focacchia very tasty small portions but very rich then we had the lobster susci lardo wrapped prawns and the balsamic glazed pork spare ribs i loved the ribs definitely my favorite out of the three we then had the spaghetti with octopus ragu and mushroom ravioli while picking on the side of truffled cabbage the ravioli dish was surreal i am not huge on pasta but will eat ravioli and these were amazing i loved his duck foie gras ravioli at scarpetta but these were light and earthy and full of flavor putting them right up there with the ones from i cannot wait to have them again i surprised myself for not loving the truffled cabbage but my boyfriend loved it so its all good i had three cosmos and was ready to get some air so we skipped dessert and walked out into the cold streets back with the mortals and cabbed it to le crepe on spring ha highly recommended
im such a loserive been living in nyc for over years and never ever heard about this place until my infamous friend chunster and rachella invited me for a nice cocktail on a saturday nighti couldnt find it thru google map but thanks to yelp i found the exact address with pictures of how this place kinda looks likenext to petite abeille and no sings of the place at all just have to find the door number once you find it you have to buzz in and someone opens the door and ask if you had rsvp or if you know someone so basically its kinda vip hidden bar and either only regulars go in or youre not allow to go insidevery dimmed lights and plenty of comfy seats chunster is a regular this bar that he rsvp for a table and i was honored to be able to join and experience this type of lifestyle waitress handed us a menu and also to demonstrate if we need to call for assistance theres a small handle to pull a button that will light up and waitress will come right to you classylittle bit of music play in the background a nice selection of cocktails at a reasonable price compare to angels share and apotheke its a tad cheaper the mini kitchen is all the way on the back and also have extra space for people to hang out there and watch the bartender how they mix and prepare for each individual drinks strong drinks with a nice ambiance is a good combination to enjoy a night in the city after a drink i have decided to check out the restroom ahemyes i had to go check it out and as per your reviewers i looked at the wall papers if they didnt say anything about wallpapers i wouldnt have pay attention at all awesome artwork of different icons of erotic positions that you can get turn on inside the bathroom but wait the wallpapers in the lounge does also have them but its too dark to be able to notice itdamn you why arent you in downtown i have to drag myself and take the train just to drink youpsi heard they have a backyard too i cant wait for summer to come

yelp saved my teeth yep thats how relieved and extremely happy i am with finding and going to dr rosenkranzmy exdentist is bad bad in every way imaginable except her friendliness with the patient which fools you into trusting her with your pearl whites not knowing where else to go and most people around me not liking their own dentist i came to yelp and found this dental practice hey i cant have that much bad luck rightdr rosenkranz is amicable courteous and very professional he explains everything he does and frequently asks you if you have any questions he takes digital xrays of areas that needs to be worked on to show it to you and puts it on file thats a pretty smart move i say he even estimated how long the procedure might laston my second appointment he worked on my tooth and made sure i was fine through out the entire process gosh i really felt good psychologically on that chair as weird as it sounded when we finished he showed me the work done and it looked so nice and felt so nice compared to my previous dentist pardon my lack of proper dental terms but the filling was the correct color of my teeth yes my previous dentist was that bad and it looked so natural like nothing ever happened therei have other areas to be worked on and i was worried with my insurance thus the doc took xrays of it and told me that hell send the proposal to the insurance company so they can mail me the estimated bill in order for me to decide thats thoughtfulthe staff are nice the receptionist is a darling oh gosh i kind of hate myself for not coming here earlier for my dental needsi wouldnt like share to dr rosenkranz with you because that means it will make scheduling an appointment harder but heck i know that having a good dentist that you can go to is one of the necessities in lifeps they take many insurances check on the websitei was not dropped when i was born i think

qualifications to judge korean restaurantsinsert statement about being korean and having grown up with korean foodinsert obnoxious statement about being from la where there are an overabundance of good korean food so i really know korean food and ny just doesnt compareinsert statement about parents being authentic koreans from korea so they know korean foodinsert statement that parents are particularly picky about korean foodokay after kun jip i had one more chance to convince my dad that ny wasnt all bad so i took them to the best korean restaurant i knew ive been praising hahm ji bach to my mother for a while but my mom is suspicious of my taste in korean food after not having lived in la for so long the best part of hahm ji bach is the ban chan side dishes i could happily make a meal out of their side dishes and rice with ban chan that goooooood you dont need anything else read my previous review for what hahm ji bach means there was a huge spread of ban chan and while certain things like different kinds of kim chi and tofu will always be there other side dishes always change the marinated tofu in the chili soy sauce mixture is my favorite along with the the korean squash my parents were mightily impressed with the quality and quantity of ban chan my mom approvingly nodded her head and agreed that they really do serve great ones she was absolutely ecstatic to see one of her favorites which is a crab kim chi like thing all other restaurants that have this have this as a special not as a free ban chan and when they serve it they give you just a small portion she was amazed with how much of it they gave to us aside from a small taste that i had she ate the whole thing herself the ban chan is always really fresh and great ive never had a single bad ban chan there plus as in the tradition of korean restaurants you can get as much ban chan as you want the waitresses are really great about figuring out what you really like and they will often times slip you another before you have a chance to request itwe had our fill of ori thinly sliced duck meat and pork bulgogi the waitress warned us that it would be spicy but it wasnt spicy at all ive had this dish three times and i have to say this was the least spicy that ive ever had it usually its spicier my parent thoroughly approve of this place both in food and price its much cheaper here for better food compared to manhattan my parents complimented the waitress about the food at the end of the meal i asked my dad once more what he thought of this restaurant compared to lahis answer was its just as good as lagot it here folks now go eat theretheyve been certifiedps hahm ji bach loves yelp they had snippets of yelpers reviews in their menu and wings review was one of them great job
five stars really yes because walter foods is my local little black dress the justclassycasualenough allpurpose bistropub that you can dress down with brunch and a buddy or dress up on a lowkeyelegant oysters date or opt for business casual at sipping sazeracs with an acquaintance in addition youll find the timelessness of sophisticated gender neutrality in dark wood benches and oldschool manlyman gin and whiskey cocktails and a seasonally apropos garden theres functionally no occasion climate or temperament that walter foods cant pull off and thats not even to speak of the foodthe menu is succinct but versatile find higherbrow fare like truffledrizzled cous cous steamed lobster and an informed little digestifs selection as well as tasty staples for coarser palates fried chicken with waffles on the weekends beer and a luscious shortrib burger the ironic drawback of an allpurpose alldelicious fullbar neighborhood hive is actually fitting into your little black dress when you have to i get carried away with analogies figuratively and literally you love me
soto is a michelin starred sushi house just off of west street how i have never been here before or have heard about this place is beyond me its a nice findi made a reservation for one but that was ultimately unnecessary since there was only one other person at the entire sushi bar on my visit i was seated in front of sotohiro kusugi himself nice a third generation sushi chef i found him to be affable in control and always professional the restaurant itself was the essence of japanese minimalism comically taken to the point of not even having a sign outside of the restaurant you will likely need the street address to find the place as i have walked by it for years unaware for dinner i opted for the piece nigiri omakase at an attractively priced i was warned that it would take some time to prepare the sushi and was strongly encouraged to try some appetizers in the mean time i found this strange but i quickly relented i additionally ordered the miso soup which surprisingly is not included in the sushi dinner to drink i went with the koshihikari echigo beer the miso came in at a pricey for a small bowl all of the other menu selections were considerably more expensive and equally appetizer sized as far as miso goes though this was considerably better than the usual offering it was jazzed up by mixing in a lobster broth with the white miso and including chunks of lobster as well as chives and ginger shoots for flavoring i appreciated the sophistication but i was not overcome by the broth the flavors did not meld as well as i would have liked also the lobster was too sparse to justify the price point now for the sushi the part that really matters the selection was impressive with some uncommon choices in the mix definitely no salmon and hamachi here this omakase was designed for the enthusiast the first selection was completely unfamiliar to me it sounded like enamae it had a characteristic green marking in its flesh and hailed from japan a nice beginning the rice was quite good soft and served at the right temperature a sign of a good sushi house the fish was fresh and melted in my mouth squid very nice i was surprised by how tender it was another good selection tasmanian ocean trout a less common selection but one i was pleased with great color the flavor and texture were wonderful aji horse mackerel fine if otherwise unremarkable stripejack this was brought out only moments after the placing of the horse mackerel at this point i noticed the tempo of the meal picking up though i understood why these two sushi might be paired together i did not have the presence of mind to ask if it was wild or farm raised it was quite tasty making me wonder if it was the wild version which is known to be rare ama ebi live sweet shrimp yes raw shrimp not that dreadful cooked shrimp that you will find at discount sushi houses this was so amazingly good the natural sweetness the texture it was all wonderful i even said as much to the itamae to which he politely smiled and nodded saba bakno more mackerel i wasnt sure what type of mackerel this was but it was enjoyable toro no proper omakase can exclude toro this example was deliciously fatty and fresh maine sea scallop with sea salt and yuzu zest a regional selection akin to the raw shrimp this too was naturally sweet and delicious good scallops are like that never a miss japanese sea bream with pickled wasabi inside the wasabi was especially noticeable with its lovely piquancy this was especially good another great selection uni noticeably large and generous in portion size this was clearly a high grade uni it too had natural sweetness good uni can be so decadent unagi freshwater eel this was fine but i was surprised that this was the final course swapping the order with the uni would have been more memorable for example a wonderful sushi experience i did not find it to be the best sushi in the city but it does easily place in my top five the ease of getting a seat with the master sushi chef and the rich diversity in the selection are distinctive points of note the place is definitely on par with ushiwakamaru if not a touch better recommend

you know the little brass sculptures that adorn the st subway station theyre the work of tom otterness whose studio is located in the gowanus in bklyn every year for open house new york weekend i try to go to tom otterness studio and every year the tours sell out instantlyso instead of tom otterness this year for open house new york weekend i got to visit a poop plantnewtown creek is the largest of nycs wastewater treatment plants with a capacity of a whopping million gallons of poop water a what attracted me to this sewage treatment plant is the look of it if frank gehry were to design a sewage treatment plant he would have created the newtown creek plantaffectionately known as the shit tits by the locals the plant has gigantic steel digester eggs each massive egg is clad with low reflectivity stainless steel is feet high and feet in diameter and holds million gallons of sludge overall they look like a gigantic space ship out of the movie duneduring our we had the opportunity to climb on top of the eggs which are connected by a bridge from the top of the egg there is a magnificent unobstructed view of brooklyn and the skyline of manhattanthe plant is illuminated by a diaphanous blue light by creating a rather odd if beautiful effect that can be seen pretty well from the bqe a sight that is sure to take your breath away for many reasonswhich other sewage treatment plant has a sleek design a visitor center and a nature walk this is most likely the coolest poop plant on during the wastewater treatment process organic material called sludge is removed from sewage much of the sludge is converted into water carbon dioxide and methane gas the remaining digested sludge is then dewatered to form a cake which can be used as a fertilizer the word cake will never have the same meaning for the visitor center is open friday and saturday noon to pm groups by appointment only to book call or email the lighting was designed by artist herv√© descottes of lobservatoire international an americanfrench company herv√© descottes is known for lighting projects ranging from the diverse architecture of steven holl and frank gehry to local projects such as lincoln center the highline and columbus circle
i want to live here that is allok thats not all but seriously it is so nice here yesterday my mom sis and i squeezed in between an italian family and a young couple on one of the ace lobbys monstrous suede sectionalsfor sure a lot of burgundy cows died for these sofasand we just stayed and stayed the large highceilinged space is filled with antique furniture and lamps and is lined with woodpaneled walls that feel as if they were plucked out of an ivy league classroom having spent much time in ivy league classrooms i feel more than qualified to comment on such detailswe started with a round from stumptown but when the last of our espressos had been sucked down we were so not ready to leave we thought about it thusly outside minus wind chill no booze vs inside cozy suede sofa yes booze the answer was obvious and we sent for the cocktail menu the only complaint i have about this whole operation is that the cocktail list is not superb it offers only or drinks none of which features whiskeyin my mind a glaring omission there should be a whiskey cocktail on every drinks menu in the city particularly during the winter months this doesnt mean of course that you cant get a whiskey drink here i had a nicely made manhattan but still i like to try a bars original creations and at breslin bar that is not compatible with wanting to drink whiskeythe drinks that we did have though were very tasty the starling st germain lillet blanc was light subtly sweet great for mom and i appreciated our server doublechecking when i unknowingly asked for the priciest rye in my manhattan or should i be insulted that i dont strike one as a highroller no matter we snacked on their caramel popcorn too and when the funsize bag arrived we at first scoffed but when we ate we nodded in agreementthis is popcorn
curry hill attracts a multiethnic crowd but most notably the indian derivatives and their visitors from far lands the men flaunting baggy wrangler shorts that amply wrap around their skinny legs no doubt raised on a steady diet of street food back in the day in bombay against this backdrop bhojan has the best indian street food and beyond in new yorkthe pav bhaji is superlative the buns are a distraction but the vegetable mash couldnt have been better if it was flown in from bombay the chaats conjure up memories of bhelpuri stalls outside colleges in india bhojan also excels in breadtry the aloo gobi paratha the methi thepla or the chole bature to name a few kinds the drinks and teas are authentic notably the fresh lemon pani and the chais and to top it all the prices are reasonableon the flip side bhojan seems severely shortstaffed the servers one of them a spitting image of sourav ganguly the indian cricketer were friendly even if thinly spread and only occasionally seen as they maneuvered their way around the closelyspaced tables and the token unruly diners in the main seating area in the backin summary bhojan squarely fills the need for high quality indian street food in new york so go get your loosefitting wranglers optional pair of sneakers and ray bans and give bhojan a try
whoever hates on this place is an absolute weirdo yeah i said it weirdo how anyone could dislike redress is something i could never comprehend great prices cute dressing rooms helpful and amazing staff this place cannot go wrong i hope it stays here forever usually shopping for me can get a little frustrating i happen to be a person who knows what cuts seams and styles look best on me but it doesnt mean those things are easily obtainable i like having a place where i can find dozens and dozens of pieces without getting annoyed my problem is that my body type isnt big enough for typical plus size clothing stores but im not small enough for the regular size clothing so where do i stand ugh from a huge rack to pancakebutt i just cant win well yes i can redress vintage trendy and actually flatteringnotsomatronlylooking threads i love it here this is your goto spot for last minute outfit shopping or if you want to spend an afternoon sifting through the racks either way i never leave this place without trying on outfits the buyselltrade portion on redress is sensational too the turnaround is about mins depending on how much stuff you have however i will recommend only bringing small amount at a time in case they dont want to buy a lot of your stuff its depressing and you have to lug that crap all the way home well unless you plan on donating it right then and therepsi once came in here and fell in love with the whole ensemble a mannequin was rockin i was drooling over the leopard print dress with the red bolero and i kept inching my way to the mannequin for only god knows how many times i was about to leave the store when one of the staff ladies asked if i would like to try it on i bashfully declined she said it wouldnt be any trouble at all to strip the whole mannequin naked wow that turned me on so i ended up trying it on it looked so marvelous i swear the other staff members who saw me come out of the dressing room almost shed a tiny tear ah how good it feels to look so damned hot muahaha

as an honorary italiano self proclaimed i have developed a serious love for the food here italian food both imported and fresh as far as the eye can see stretching for what seems like forever and winding through a maze that you never want to end seriously chocolate section shelves of honey shelves of fruit preserves dried pasta section fresh pasta station meat butchers vegetable butchers seafood station pizza station wine section cheese station pasta sauce galore i got a ravioli with prosciutto and parmesan and it was incredible after the pasta cooked the meat juices from the prosciutto melted into the ravioli and so there was a nice little burst of meaty soup in every bite it actually kind of reminded me of soup dumplings mmm nam nam nam namand as a certified cheapskate my wallet has developed a serious love for the prices here ball of fresh mozz for that portion of freshly made ravioli with prosciutto and parmesan need i say more and yeah as a realist i can see how it can get hectic here with the windy aisles haughty and hangry client√®le and random checkout lanes that cant be found but thats a very very small price to pay imo for the land of affordable deliciousness everywherehungry and angry
located on the floor toward the back of flushing mall joong han boon sik or chinesekorean noodles dumpling is proof of two things some of the best food in flushing is found in a mall and its not in the food court with such good food this is the kind of asian fusion worth tryingunlike most asian fusion places there is no pretension here as its a small food stall tucked away from the rest of the competition even the staff here is able to communicate in both languages the owner tells me shes from the dongbei dongbaek in korean region of china a northeast section of the country that is home to many ethnic koreansdumplings are their main staple here all made fresh and in several meat and vegetable varieties along with that are a nice selection of noodle dishes that complement the dumplings perfectly throw in a small side like their kimchi napa cabbage and the stage for a delicious meal is setthough i enjoy all of their dumplings the ones that personally stand out most are the steamed four kinds dumpling mandarin si zhong jiao zi korean nae suhn mool mahn doo which are filled with sea cucumber egg pork and shrimp the skin might seem doughy but is usually just thin enough to retain the juicy innards that make each bite delectable and savory of these dumplings can be had for between depending on the filling and for another a giant bowl of cold korean noodles chinese zhong han leng mian korean jong han myun can be had to complete the effect on a whole the food is simple fresh reasonably priced and above all deliciousdumpling lovers who are looking for a different alternative to the northern chinese dumplings should venture to flushing mall where the best dumpling debate has only become more heated
leave the gun take the cannoliclemenzabecause of villabate i have come to understand the pure cannoli zen of this statement best cannoli everthe front window of the store has multiple shelves for display filled from end to end with pastries such that i felt i was about to walk into some sort of childhood sugar fantasy world on acid who could possibly be buying and eating all this its hard to imaginethe store looks clean and new and the service is efficient the biggest problem youll have is choosing what to buy because there are so many tempting things in addition to traditional pastries there are whacky creations that on this visit included seasonal items like a new years cake with a confectionery clock i gather for counting down to ha the place was just a hair short of pee wees playhouse i swearwe were greeted by a lifesized singing santa claus standing next to the door as you walk in if clowns scare you this could be problematical for me it added to the italianstyle charlie and the chocolate factory atmosphere that pervades the establishment its quite a placeon to the cannolinormally i like me some chocolate covered cannoli which are not available at villabate so when i stood in line with none other than atif i aka best pizza crawl companion in the city it was with no small amount of trepidation that i waited for our cannoli to be wrapped up for takeout hed billed this as the best one hed ever had and the man does his research how could the best cannoli in the city not have a chocolate coating it was hard to fathomas we sat in the car after leaving i watched with nervous anticipation as he opened the box to reveal what turned out to be two perfect confections dusted with powdered sugar and adorned with a candied orange sliver on one end and a dried maraschino cherry on the other one bite and i was convinced this was the best cannoli on earth the shell was crispy but didnt fall apart it was sweet and flavorful and i didnt miss the chocolate coating i normally have one bit in fact it made me realize that chocolate coatings on cannoli are really just trying to make up for the mediocrity of the shells they cover if the shell is quality you dont need that chocolate the ricotta inside was fresh sweet and absolutely delicious and nicely but not overly laden with chocolate chips the entire experience was eyeopening i will be backmax dits clear you have some sort of grudge against villabate because what you said is so unbelievably off the mark theres no other possibility not only do you insult an amazing pastry shop for what seems to be no reason and cite one inaccuracy after another but you insult the entire neighborhood go back to freakin florida where you belong the fact that you left nyc for that awful place wait you live in boca and youre somehow insulting bensonhurst reveals volumes about what a complete and utter douche you are and why nothing you say or think is to be trusted by anyoneas they say in brooklyn geh da faaaahhk outtaa heeeyyaahhkthxbye
jungle curry hot hot hotjungle curry is the only item on the menu at ploy thai which has in parenthesis by it very spicy how spicy do you want it our waitress asked hot and spicy very spicy we told her she looked at us with a discerning stare jungle curry is spice for real thai people she warned us my friend assured her he had it before and could handle it we made our other two dishes mild just to balance out the jungle curryfor the average american the jungle curry will have them running out of the restaurant screaming like tarzan it is spicy just as the waitress had informed it is really spicy with a level of heat that is associated with authentic thai style cooking we had chosen pork for our jungle curry and it was served mixed in with green beans and bamboo shoots the spice is infused in the dish even if you do not spoon extra curry sauce on your meat or get any peppers you will taste the heat its delicious and it will stay with you for the next five minutes if you have ever felt dulled by life get this dish it will wake you up and bring you to your senses it is not recommended to eat this dish like a soup i could only eat a little bit of the jungle curry but my friend was eating it by the spoon and forkfuls i watched in amazement and laughed as beads of sweat fell down his face hats off to anyone who can stomach this dishthe other items we ordered were just as wonderful we tried the special appetizer miang khanal which was recommended by a thai friend it is a medley of ingredients i suspect were shredded pork lime wrind crushed peanuts etc it is served with the leaves of broccoli and you wrap it up like a burrito its crunchy salty sweet and the burst of citrus flavor was perfect during this degree heat miang khanal is extremely refreshing the pad kra prao of crispy pork in basil sauce and pad kee mao flat noodles with chicken were more of the typical thai dishes and more spicy than mild and very good i love that the food at ploy thai is spicy and not withered down for you and me overall i enjoyed the food much more here than at sripraphai its less disneyland less razzle dazzle and there is definitely no smoke and mirrors ploy thai is that hole in the wall restaurant with phenomenal food it looks like a take out place and at first i scoffed that my friend had chosen a restaurant that wasnt even really a restaurant the food speaks for itself and the flavors shine through despite the heat welcome to thailand via elmhurstill just assume this if i am making an ass out of myself so be it skip the steamed thai dumplings appetizer it tastes like frozen shu mai it was so lackluster that it didnt deserve to be in the body of my review
i waited a week to write my review looking for a material worthy of my stars and i think god finally heard me on a sundayi heard many things about degustation but honestly i didnt think it would deserve stars somehow however things happen always when you least expect it nor looking i was so fully satisfied at degustaion this evening to the point that i would want to sing ode to joy in soprano unfortunately i didnt have enough gut space left to pull that off and also wanting to remain elegant in this sexy place where full of people who couldnt stop gushing about their own dishes to their next bar mates we were seated comfortably at the middle of the bar and even could choose our own seats yes sunday is a good day to visit degustation the setting reminded me of joel robuchons latelier in paris my first experience of culinary art dinner about years ago but there the kitchen stations are a little far or separated no tables of course but bars resembling a sushi bar where you are served at it was quite a sensation then and we saw people lined up for the daily opening time here you see the kitchen you can see them working and you can see them do everything closely that being said almost towards to the end of dinner i feel the grill heat and felt hot a little the service here is very pleasant and attentive the chef wesley genovart and his chefs are cute and passionate about their work we quite enjoyed watching the iron chef like slow paced than that though cooking process wine selections are mostly from spain my santiago rioja viura was born supremacy and ended up being one of my ever favorites it has every notes that i love about not too sour not too sweet with creamy oak barrel and tobacco taste to it we chose to have course tasting menu per person thinking courses would be too much it turned out that course are more than you can handle and tiny but very rich degustation is a french term for tasting experience focusing on sensory system and the degustation is very true to that and during the entire dinner i felt like i have been one of the judges in the iron chef show and trying to discover each dish and that really made our dinner more fun times that i most appreciate about dishes are when everything tastes like what it should be in other words everything tasted like the said ingredients and its best in degustation and no gimmick of million mixes of too complicated sauces or unidentifiable materials the lamb loin which i am not usually a fan of tasted like a little tender lamb with rather pleasing lamb aroma four different kind of grilled heirloom cauliflowers uniquely tasted as four distinctive nuttiness surrounded by the perfect pine nut puree and pickled raisins fresh snapper sashimi was brushed with sea salt based coat just enough topped with fragrant micro siso leaves sauces here are subtle but very complimenting and gracefully amazing like silky spreading pates grilling process for pork belly is intervallic in order to get the perfect crispiness eggs are pouched in the shells and poured onto the grill to be pan fried seasoning is minimal with controlled salting on the main ingredient but it is all compensated well by sauces or dressings my dessert not part of the course caramelized torja torrijas with strawberry was glorious it is like french toast in spanish version but more like doughy marshmallow like than soaked bread so good chocolate pudding with banana cream and salty rice puffs was also very satisfyingthe experience at degustation is like happiness of my senses it is not exciting and adventurous joy but they recognizewhat good and fine things are tastes so balanced and understandable that you feel content appreciation of when seeing someone understands you so well and making you smile or someone enlightened about what it is really about and has just told me i dont know i dont know what exactly but i dont care if you understand it or not because it was that greati am going back for courses very soon

take it from somebody who has actually lived in mexico this place is about as authentic as it gets i also have good authority to support my story because i ate with a friend who was born and raised in mexico and she concurs that this is the first place weve been to in the united states that actually tastes like the food tastes in mexicoafter trying taco mix it makes me wonder why there are so many southern california transplants on yelp complaining about how there are no authentic mexican restaurants in new york but those people are complaining on places that it should be obvious that it wouldnt be authentic i see these complaints in reviews for clearly americanized burrito shops and vegan burrito places which is clearly nothing like real mexican i even saw one guy from orange county say this grilled portabello mushroom burrito is the most authentic mexican ive found in new york referring to burrito boxs vegan burritos i dont even want to list the millions of things wrong with that statement anyone who comes here to taco mix and says its not authentic is either a lying or b oblivious as to what authentic is now i love the state of california and its inhabitants but come on people you cant complain about lack of authenticity if youre not even going to the right places also authentic doesnt necessarily mean what you are used to eating as a child in southern california authentic mexican is from mexico in fact ive been to southern california many many many times in my life and always look forward to trying mexican food there but i got a news flash for everyone i have never tried anything in southern california that tastes as authentic as taco mix when i walked in to this little dive in spanish harlem i immediately knew that it was going to be authentic because i saw how they were preparing the al pastor now most mexican places that ive been to in america wont even have the slowroasting spinning spit and some of them who do dont quite have the correct visual confirmation of something truly mexican this meat was huge and thick when i saw the spinning wheel of al pastor memories from younger years in mexico came flooding back into my head the pork on the slowroasting wheel looked visually juicy and thick and the way they carved it was exactly how i witnessed in mexico theyre like surgeons finely slicing the leanest softest and juiciest pork you will ever see also they actually include all constituents pineapple cilantro and onion its simple because the meat is so juicy that all you need aside from the above three condiments is maybe some lime juice when i bit into it it was a confirmation that i finally have found an authentic mexican place in america ive searched far and wide for something this close to the real thing in many different american cities including regions like southern california and texas and have never found such a close facsimile in my life this makes all the somewhat authentic places ive been trying in queens and brooklyn actually look americanized by comparison i saw in another review by ben l that he called it pastor paradigm shift those are a beautiful string of words and i love his review but i have to humbly disagree that this is the pastor paradigm shift this is what real pastor in mexico tastes like all the pastor ive been eating around america is the true paradigm shiftthe aberration from the norm the pastor here firmly regrounded me to what actual mexican food tastes like and how far off every other taqueria ive tried in america is from getting it right im not saying authentic places like this dont exist in america because i didnt even know this existed until yesterday but let me tell you that it is extremely rare like finding a pregnant unicorn or something ever since my childhood years in mexico ive searched for this and have only encountered it now over a decade latersope de al pastor it was huge and the first real sope ive had in a decade quesadilla de queso try the quesadillas here if you want to know how far off base tgi fridays is when they call their quesadilla a quesadilla notice the soft tortilla that was made crunchy through frying and the unique combination of cheeses inside it was transcendental and a true treat add some of their delicious green salsa to compliment the cheesetacos al pastor the first true tacos al pastor ive tried outside of mexico if you havent been to mexico you must try these to understand why mexicans giggle when you order vegan burritos and fajitas the meat was lean yet lightly marbleized it was soft throughout and you dont find that occasional crunchy piece you find in street carts it was slow roasted all day and tender as can be jarritos they have a great selection of my favorite mexican soda i recommend trying the mandarin or fruit punch flavors
i love everything about this bakery singleminded dedication to one product the quirky signposts that point you toward the bakeshop the remote location that keeps the hoi polloi away outdoor picnic tables surrounded by floridian foliage the swingle frozen pie on a stick covered in callebaut chocolate the bracingly tart keylime filling that makes my mouth pucker reasonable prices for pie for the sign on the door that says we do not sell coffee we do not know about available real estate in the area we do not make apple pieif i ever started a business id run it exactly this way except i wouldnt make key lime pies or any type of pie i hate baking
imagineits the early and a twin brother and sister about years old are hard at work in the kitchen of their familys apartment in queens even when i was i knew the power of food and how a great snack is the perfect way of showing how much you love someone unfortunately at that age our culinary prowess was certainly lacking my sister and i decided to serve banana splits although we were at a loss of what was served on a banana split except for a banana and ice cream improvising we decided to fry the banana in an overly greased pan with globs of napoleon ice cream and garnished with black olives and then watched as our family ate it smiling through clenched teeth and tearing years and banana splits later my older sister and i roll into lulas sweet apothecary an adorable vegan ice cream spot situated in manhattans east village everything is antiquated from the tin signs the boxes for the toppings and even the spoons which are shaped like very mini shovels how appropriate our server brad was extremely kind and walked us through building our banana split because damned if i knew it was three scoops of ice cream and three different toppings traditionallywe decided to have ours made up of rum raisin cake batter and chocolate chocolate chip ice creams topped with marshmallow caramel and caramelized pecans so you can imagine how sad i was when i found out that lulas is cash only and i peeled open my wallet to find only one dollar and perhaps a few flies zipping out of itbrad however didnt miss a beat encouraging us to eat our ice cream before it melted and just run to the atm once were done which i can only describe as totally awesome on his partthis place really is a gem and everyone should consider having their dessert here the totally guiltless cashew based ice cream which is all made on site doesnt have that peculiar aftertaste that soy based vegan ice creams do and is just perfect on a summer day
confession ive dated men because of their dogsthere were two cuddly shiba inus one very smart french bulldog and a shy elegant whippet to date however ive never dated a man because of his apartment that might change ive met someone who lives dangerously close to taim two out of the two times ive been to his apartment weve gotten takeaway falafels and other goodies i can now safely say that all of the falafel flavors there are holy and pure and fanfckingtastic previously id only tried the green shame on me not to mention the smoothies especially the mint and pear one ahh its a good thing i like this guy and i do i hope i keep getting invited over
after my lovely but ultimately less than earthshattering experience at sister restaurant hidechan i wasnt sure what to expect out of totto ramen early on itd gotten a huge amount of mainstream food blogger attention and if theres anything im reverseracist about its when americans get excited about asian restaurants still i worship the totto empire and getting off early from work one day i decided to make the pilgrimage to the west sideinitial signs were encouraging short staircase down into the narrow space explosively steaming pots behind the counter the smell of chicken heavy in the air a couple of japanese cooks in bandanas shouting their welcomes at me it was the most authenticfeeling friendliest ramenya id been in in nyc besides the old sapporo whose food couldnt live up to the setting though i have not revisited since its renovation i nodded at the cooks and took a seat in a stool less than a minute later my order was in the options are few and i went with the purist choice the totto chicken paitan ramen less than two minutes after that the bowl was in front of methe chickenbased broth was spectaculari thought that deserved to be in its own paragraph id always assumed that the sujebi soup at arirang in koreatown would be the most nuclear blast of capitalc chicken i would ever have the privilege of tasting but tottos paitan ramen edges it out its so creamy so chickeny that its difficult to capture the experience in words a burst of primary colors after a lifetime in blackandwhiteramen is the most holistic of all noodle soups so a broth alone cannot make the bowl luckily the noodles are gorgeously springy specimens easily better than those at ippudo setagaya and oddly hidechan and the char siu slices are as perfect as hidechans not only standing tall in that dynamo of a chicken broth but melding seamlessly with it in an indescribable melange of animal flavorsa single bowl of ramen is usually more than enough to sate me but here i ordered a kaedama ie an extra helping of noodles to dump into my leftover broth its virtually a second bowl for i finished it just as quickly then noisily slurped up the remaining soup honoring japanese tradition as best i couldi dont give five stars for a single visit very often but totto ramen serves up a bowl of ramen that i like significantly more than the pork bomb at ippudo or the tightropebalanced hakata of rockmeisha indeed the only two ramen bowls ive had in the states that i like more are at the holy ground of santouka in edgewater nj and redacted nyc establishment here you will have to torture me or be my one true love to find out im going to go even further and put totto ramen in the upper echelon of best solo dinner spots in the city period you could bring a date here of course but you better be ready for her tongue to taste like chickenas i got up to leave the usual japanese chorus of goodbyes caressed me for the first time in my life instead of just bowing my head slightly i actually turned to my ramen cook and said gochisousama deshitahe smiled arigatouarigatou yourself totto ramenprobability of return within year
ive met and made friends with the deviland ariane is her name last saturday was my first day of bootcamp and honestlyit hurts to type this review because you are using muscles in your arms to extend your fingersand everything on me hurts right now i am not fiti am not a runnerand i cannot do push ups so why in the hell did i purchase of these classes because like you youre probably in a rut tired of going to the gymhave youve been trying to lose for the past few months or maybe you know that you need someone to kick your ass back into action well ariane is the woman for youand kicking butt is what she doesstretchingsquatsjumping resistance bandspushups running are all forms of torture in my opinion but hey we signed up for itshe is extremely motivating supportiveand god damnt she remembers your name i wish she didnt remember mineslol she pushed mebecause my fat ass cannot run to keep up with these people for the life of me and she told me that i am not pushing myself to my limit which i wasnt even though i was sore as hell i woke up the next dayand walkedjogged i would never do so she definitely gave me the kickstart that i needed i have more classes to go and although im dreading itwith every fiber in my body i know i need to go so if youre considering this class go for it its worth every pennyfor her encouragement advice and a killer workoutwith a gorgeous view i will never look at the brooklyn bridge the same wayever again
this review is dedicated to all you sillies who think joes shanghai has the best soup dumplings in nyc you are mistaken very very mistaken in fact i think that joes is average joe compared to nan shian probably more accurately translated as nan xiang nan shian has some of the best soup dumplings ive had second only to din tai fung in taiwan if you like soup dumplings make the trek to flushing and try this place but prepare to wait though they recently expanded and the restaurant is now twice as large as it was before there is still an average min wait for a table after you are seated make sure to order the soup dumplings right away theres a min wait for the dumplings to be steamed from when you order it but its worth it besides there are plenty of other yummies on the menu to divert your attention for those minutes my favorite dishes at nan shian are spicy beef and tripe slices fu qi fei pian stir fried rice cakes with seafood hai xian chao nian gao sliced beef wrapped in pancake niu rou jia bing and of course the star of the meal the xlb featuring thin skins tender pork and rich flavorful soup ive tried both the plain pork soup dumplings and the pork and crab ones i prefer the pork and crab ones because the soup is a little thicker and i love the flavor that the crab adds it was brought to my attention that not everyone knows how to eat a soup dumpling without making a mess so without further ado i present to you the simple guide to eating a soup dumplingfirst use the provided tongs to pinch the top part of the soup dumpling and lift slowly and gently so that you dont rip the dumpling skin once you have successfully transported your soup dumpling from the tray to your spoon you can pat yourself on the back because the hard part is over now bite a small hole in the top of your soup dumpling and suck out the juices if youre afraid of burning your tongue you can dump out the juices into your spoon after biting a hole in the top then after enjoying the hot soup drizzle a little sauce and ginger on top of the dumpling and eat up
in nyc its getting to the point where there are so many burgers i love that those old boring cow burgers are just not going to cut it at least as far as trying new burgers goes not to dis my fellow cows that can taste great when prepared correctly but its time to watch out because the lambs bison and their friends are stampeding their way swiftly into the world of burgers it kinda makes me laugh when i think about lambs and bison stampeding together actually anywhozer ive been hearing about the breslins lamb burger for a while ive seen in on tv in photos and even in person while sitting with my laptop in the ace hotels lobby ive heard many many things about this burger and none of them badbeing that i find myself in the aces lobby with a fresh brew from stumptown more than my own living room i figured i had to finally crawl over to the breslin and try out this burger ive heard so much aboutwe went and sat in the dim room and were seated immediately upon arrival at about when they reopen for dinner we had to learn this the hard way though because we got there at only to be told they are closed between between lunch and dinner whatever it couldve been worse there could have not been a stumptown and great couches to kill some timethe booth was comfortable and the waitress was friendly with a semifunny personality the kind where she says a joke but you dont know whether to laugh at it or not because she didnt trigger laughter with a smile smirk nothing we placed our simple order of two lamb burgers which came with thrice fried chips fries ya dummy and cumin mayo the food was out in about minutes or so give or take a fewthe burger seems to be about ounces a very nice size indeed the problem with a lot of big burgers is how they seem to fall apart because it is slightly undercooked but this one was cooked and seasoned perfectly the casing was great it held in all of the juices before the first bite and was seasoned to perfection to balance the slight gameyness of the lambthe top the patty with melted feta cheese with the lamb being greek and all and a few slivers of fresh red onionthe first bite was great but just be ready for those juices to run down the burger because those juices stir up quite a mess not exactly the worst kind of mess i might add the cumin mayo was delicious too and was indeed very cuminy it went along with the burger nicely thoughthe fries blew me away these might be the best fries i have had in nyc maybe ever better than pomme frites better than balthazar better than katzs better than shake shack thickly cut rectangular prisms made of potato thrice fried of course they were perfect fries and the cumin mayo was a great dipping compliment to these amazing chipsall in all this burger moves up on my list to my favorite burger currently simple seasoning perfectly cooked mediumrare as they recommend and as any burger should be delicious feta cheese and a great great bun the fries like i said are perfect it also doesnt hurt only having to spend for such a highquality burger with great fries rather than almost at certain places we skipped on dessert and just got a second round of stumptown which to me is the best way to top off any mealgo get this lamb burger now
i think i have fallen in love the last time i felt this happy after a meal was at nougatine jean georges in august since nougatine ive been eyeing jean georges vongerichten restaurants after this fantastic meal at convivio i am inspired and intrigued to try other michael white restaurants alto mareathe teasei would have bypassed this restaurant any day its a bit out of the way in tudor city only great for those that work near the united nations i was inspired to go try convivio after reading a few postings on chow as well as getting great reviews from my younger bro bigger foodie than i am it was even better to know that convivio was participating in the extended restaurant weekthe plani took a staycation day off on a friday and took bf here for lunch i had initially made plans to go for the extended restaurant week lunch however after reading the menu bf and i both decided to order off the business lunch menu the business lunch is courses choose between appetizer first course and second source for atmospherethere is outdoor seating but we opted to sit indoors as it was humid that day otherwise if the weather was nicer definitely worth it to sit outside inside the restaurant can be described as casual elegant white and crisp just lovely table setting olive bread with olive oil foodbf and i each ordered a pasta dish as the course i ordered a halibut as the course and bf ordered diver scallops as his second every dish was executed perfectly the malloreddus pasta dish as well as the ippoglosso east coast halibut dish were both recommendations from our waiter malloreddus sardinian saffron gnocchetti crab sea urchin forgot name of pasta dish pasta pomodoro ippoglosso east coast halibut capesante diver scallops ordering our selected dishes we asked our waiter for advice on wine paring he gave us suggestions based on our dishes and we selected the molise falaghina to which he gave a long description but the words green apple caught my attention bf and i both agreed that this was the perfect wine to go with the dishes that we had ordered since of them had seafood recommended white wine molise falanghina dessertsthe food wine paring were both oh so good that we wanted to continue on the high to continue we each ordered a dessert yup thats right two desserts as you ladies gentlemen know bf and i usually order one dessert to split both desserts were delish bomboloni dessert chocolate custard filled italian doughnut white chocolate orange dipping sauce creme fraiche panna cotta dessert would definitely be coming back to convivio food and service were top notch definitely worth the michelin guide star ratingto end the experience inthe restroom before leavingcan you spare a square
sober or drunk gay or straight black or beige yellow or gold this is where one gets ones eat on to keep ones fat onchicken and lamb combo over rice throw in that pita you put your own white hot and barbecue sauce on rookies beware the red sauce is a lot hotter than you think just a few dashes are enough and this is coming from a kimchi loving korean whose maternal line has a minor history of stomach ulcers dont sleep on the barbecue sauce though for starters your clothes will get all mussed up for closers it makes your whole dish so much better trustthe line really aint that long and its really the wait that is the secret ingredient dont cut corners and go across the street unless you a veteran and know the way its the wait my friends that makes it all worth your while but if you find your while turning into a whine it is rumored that the identical cart on the east side of and is owned by a single halal conglomerate sourcing the same ingredients from one origin the middle east no just kidding astoriaoffensive maybe delicious oh you know it baby
i hate cupcakes i think they are at worst tasteless wonders and at best a bakers afterthoughthowever the cupcakes from here make me like these confections a little more and the reason why is because the cake batter is like cake batter should be moist flavorful with a lovely texture it tastes like cake and not like the dry crap most other places pronounce as cupcake battera cupcake shouldnt have to rely on icingfrosting to make it good and sweet revenge delivers on a fantastic cupcake the frosting isnt bad eithergo here for a real cupcake
this is definitely the happening cuban spot in all of fort greene this is not your normal restaurant buildyou know the hollywood gag props that have a pair of legs sticking out from a building or a backside of a nyc taxi two stories up habana is the real thing with a taco druck wedged between the inside and outside patio portions of the establishment when you first walk in from the restaurant side there are two lines is for everything while is only for corn and drinks i assume this is to speed up the process of ordering the top portion of the receipt goes to the truck outside if you ordered any food the server shots out names of ready orders lets begin with the famous corn dare i say it rivals the corn on the cob from smoke joint right down the street yes it is nicely charred a little dry topped with butter sauce queso seasoning and a limenext up is the cuban sandwich voted best in ny was it it very well could be with roasted pork ham swiss cheese all finely sliced with pickles and chipotle mayo a split crispy toasted hero delivers the meaty goodness to your mouthis that tuna i tastethe mexican grilled cheese is what we would call a cheese quesadilla made with a commercial flatiron press what makes the one at habana special is the green and white sauce that they generously drown the thing in yum it comes in two large piecesi washed everything down with a small yet flavorful cup of the ginger pineapple lemonade whilst sitting outside with a hayload of patrons it was an ideal scene for this warm summer night i did consider the for a frozen mojito steep but i will be back one day looking for refreshment
if you travel through portugal north to south east or west is aldea the type of restaurant that you will normally experience well is not i truly know that however george mendes has a clear portuguese heritage not only in his name but in the way to express his cooking as well actually to be accurate aldea has been tagged as a iberian restaurant portugal and spain which is more appropriate based in his menu but he has been also trained in some of the best kitchens he has learned modern culinary technics an develop his skills under names as berasategui or david bouley and that that has been imprinted on him as well as result sophisticated simple food traditional dishes based in high quality ingredients that only someone creative formed and talented can transform in a exciting experience for your senses i could taste a total of dishes and different dessert during our lunch for people and everything was perfect not only the food but the service and the ambiance as well aldea however seems to be a black sheep at yelp as to me it doesnt make sense this discrepancy in the rates without unconsider others opinions i cant other than give them a having on mind that i still need to see how are they doing during busy times and even when is a good representation i want to try more dishesaldea gave me the best cheese plate i had in a long time obviously your personal taste play an important role in this assertion but among the immense variety of cheese produced either in spain or portugal he chose an interesting combination that reflects not only knowledge but a try to surprise and satisfy you this selection must have been discussed for a while all were creamy in texture and a progression in flavor the strongest one i loved it from la serena similar to torta del casar a cheese that you will not want to keep at home for long its served with membrillo quince jelly as the tradition dictates and walnutraisin bread the pear and arugula salad was maybe the most regular dish in our lunch as seems like you are not a chef is your salads doesnt include nuts andor fruits it was delicious the nuts where mashed and toasted in a pan and the mozzarella was just fantastic creamy tasty and fresh like the difference between eating regular tofu or homemade my main entree was the scallops served with farro risotto cucumber and orange the scallops were like butter and melted in my mouth instantly but as much as i loved them the risotto was incredible you know that you can order this rice dish in the lunch menu i suggest you to do it and the orange slices over the scallops were just so refreshing and fit so well with the dish the organic chicken breast with bok choy mushrooms and coconut curry can be defined as surprising satisfying and superior quality the meat was tender and flavorful it looked fresh and healthy and the sauce was so good and unexpected but complimenting the meat flavor in a way that chicken is not boring any more but then i could taste the spanish mackerel a la plantxa with escabeche jus and zucchini ribbons this one i loved it the fish seems crudo uncooked when is presented to you but is not a la plancha is barely cook in a pan and the look was a sign of a good escabeche a marination for fish that is the spanish version for ceviche the meat was firm but tender at the same time and the escabeche jus juice is a concentration of the fish flavors than enhance the dish to finish we also order their seasalted chatham cod with scrambled egg black olive and crispy potato if there is something that i remember about my many trips to portugal in the past for years is my dad ordering every single time salted cod with potatoes a featured portuguese dish at aldea it was like the one you get there keeping the traditional flavor of roasted potatoes but scale up because is was soaked in a foam that carries all the flavors of the dish the restaurant is designed with modern taste natural and comforting eating there is so pleasant you are surrounded by blue walls and botanical you feel so clean in here it can be either intimate for dinner but also a destination for a business lunch aldea has an open kitchen and you know how we are all fascinated seeing them cooking what will be your food in a few minutes chef mendes was there all the time with a bunch of chefs that looked like an army working in harmony considering the variability in the reviews you can just do what i did i decided go for lunch first and give a try course menu after this as you already know im gonna come back for dinner

lets call this one if i were a catif i were a cat id happily spend my days purring against the friendly knowledgable staff at casellula id likely be found by the bar lapping up wine from my little milk bowl and i would never be confused by the hundred different choices in cheese and wine because the servers here will explain it in such simple terms because you know my vocabulary is quite limited as a member of the feline community and because is a lot for a cat id be grateful for the thoughtful bite pairings that come with the cheesesif i were a cat id make cute faces at the customers think puss in boots from shrek so theyd let me share their dessert any one is fine really from their everchanging dessert menu this would be my cozy den this would be my cheese heavenand id always land on my feet just sayinand no more mice problem because guess whod have eaten all the cheese shhps guess whos been here times in the last months sometimes i think theyre looking at me going you again
this place makes me a lot less inspired to whine about not having access to good southern barbecue now southern barbecue it is not but mile end has achieved the level of gastronomic greatness i have previously only acknowledged of talented carolinian pork handlers take that how you may i have tried to have other dishes than the brisket sandwich but they are usually sold out after having the brisket sandwich several times i can only assume that their burger might make my eyes roll so far back in my head that i would lose them permanently so its not at all a bad deal to be stuck with another mile end brisket sandwich the feral cats downstairs who scarf the fat scraps from my sandwiches also mentioned that they would give mile end a big thumbs up if they only had thumbs
in a city where liquors bills are frequently larger then food bills i am so grateful for the recherch√© opportunities byob affords me normally i would consider a appetizersized goat cheese tart depravingly lush for my wallet but at the rickety table with my chiller of sauvignon blanc i allow myself such a scandalous indulgence and after savoring this tart i would without hesitation order this devastatingly delicious tart no matter the cost the crispy crust cradles a soft blend of goat cheese mingled with grapes and truffles repose under a veil of days aged swiss cheese the cheese coats the mouth in warm milky affection while the grapes sweetness flickers like sparkles all over the tongue as the floral earthiness of the truffle lingers in the background slowly filling the nose with its musty essence a simple and rare earthly delight

very much like the bars in munich this place is great i went there a couple of days ago to meet some folks and it was lively packed and had an amazing atmosphere the beer was great as were the sizes i met lots of new friends the place is pretty well decorated for the holidays classy decorated not cheesy decorated i was very impressed in general with the place and how nice the bartenders were there are big tables so that groups of people can sit and have fun it is a loud place so if you want to have a quiet conversation or have a romantic night this probably is not your place unless of course your idea of romance is actually living a little rather than sitting around talking about stuff that you will find out in six months probably isnt true anyway like really live a little this place is great i have not tried any food there but i am definitely going to go back soon i walked by on a sunday and there was a line out the door to get inafter my great experience i was tempted to ditch my plans and get on said line
this is the best taiwanese restaurant in flushing very authentic and true taiwanese places have been dropping like flies since the early decade with the place on the corner that use to sell shaved ice to green leaf and now even has downgraded try the three cup chicken it is as authentic as it gets a few warnings they are very taiwanese it means a sense of snobbery and self entitlement not the best service in the world but old school taiwanesechinese restaurants dont pride themselves on service but for the food itself there is a reason why tipping is very foreign back in the days good note to keep in mindexample a friend and i stopped by to order take out and we both wanted the cup chicken and she kept trying to tell me thats a lot of food and it comes with rice and veggies erf i want two orders leave me alone and then i ordered the pigs blood rice cakes and she responded in her best impression of what i can only best describe as my taiwanese grandma that i shouldnt order it because it would be no good by the time i got home itll be too soft i said eff you i want my pigs blood grrrrgranny was right they were no good when i got home get my drift

dont let my recent financials fool you receipt for scuba certification with michael f one skydiving deposit for this weekend im no adrenaline junkie far from it i in fact peed my pants typing the word skydiving just nowthis is however probably one of the few remaining summers where pantswetting youthful exuberance is totally okay and when disposable income can be be slung flung and tossed with reckless abandon not that there was anything reckless about my very safe fullyloadedwithawesome introductory trapeze lessonfor the paltry price of per head our group of learned and performed progressive tricks over hours each participant was given two chances to complete each trick before moving onto the next the below are to my mind the five things you ought to know about flying this is not an athletic endeavor the most strenuous exertion involves a little bit of flexibility and some elementary hangingon plus youve got both a harness and a handler a lovely barechested man that guides your trajectory with a pole in case you cant muster the requisite momentum by leaping forward off the platform at this is not a particularly difficult endeavor its not like snowboarding or the argentine tango a more inappropriate analogous activity would be sex the experiential difference between someone whos never done it and someone whos done it one time is weirdly magnified in other words you will be able to complete tricks at the close of two the thrill factor is lowmoderate thanks to a virtually nonexistent danger element which is in turn thanks to the safety net harness barechested handler and constant supervision by instructors the most nervewrecking few seconds are probably when youre standing atop the platform awaiting your first aside from socks bring your camera and some buds its a highly photogenic activity and youre gonna love your pictures this is without question the best organized fun ive ever had in manhattan id highly recommend it for an edgy corporate event or creative date or birthday party or as we did it in a casual crowd of friends and without an agenda we were all glowing for the subsequent hours i will almost certainly be back before the end of summer i hope ive convinced you to check it out as well please excuse me now as i diaper up for my skydiving excursion

for my parents last night in town it was moms choice although she is not an official yelper yet she has been yelping in her own way for years and years talk about food critic this woman is hard to please so whenever they come to nyc for a visit i always have to make sure if we go out to out that my mom is at least half way satisfied or we will not hear the end of it she said shed be interested in chinese food and keeping it simple but it better not be greasy it better not have too much salt no msg blah blah blah blahwho can i run to thank goodness i happen to have a boyfriend with great taste and he knew just the spot that my mom and dad were sure to love okayhere goeswinnerwe decided to each order different dishes and share we started off with the szechuan pork dumplings wroasted chilli soy very tasty i dont think my parents have ever had chinese pork dumplings before so i urged them to try and surprisingly no complaints good startfor our main dishes we got chicken wbroccoli sliced chicken wmixed vegetables braised tender pork wnapa roasted chili and finally the braised whole bass wsichuan chilli miso they were able to accommodate my dads special request on that pork to make it only half as spicy as it had four chili peppers next to it meaning it would probably burn the hell out of your mouth usually my parents do no eat white pasta bread or rice they were also able to accommodate their replacement of white rice with brown rice the hot tea was also really nicelarge portions great presentation and best of all not only did we leave with enough leftovers for lunch the next day but my parents really were impressed and enjoyed their meal highly recommended if youre in the mood for some great chinese food at a reasonable price

wall and water might conjure up images of the hoover dam but is simply a hip creative and fresh restaurant in the financial district that is located on the second floor of the andaz hyatt hotel on wall street waws wow factor comes from equal parts of its impressive entrance through a marble stairway the high ceilings and stylishly appointed interiors the welcoming and friendly service and importantly the abundance of wholesome foodi was here for a celebratory dinner thanks to the thoughtful planning and patronage of a dear friend we opted for the family style tasting menu of note the boiled artichokes were delicate even if a little messy to consume three of the four cheeses were a hit the chickpeas potpie with a puff pastry crust was excellent as advertised and the chocolate dessert was rich and fillingwaw is by far the best dining option in the financial district while the assortment might be relatively narrow for a vegetarian and the ambience not as happening as one might expect for dinner the overall food and service quality coupled with my friends enthusiasm to make this a memorable experience raise it to a solid fivestar experience
my adventures with french men led me to kenka i had never been before and i was super excited for the cotton candy machine but first we were to sober up with beer kenka has really cheap beer which sort of tastes like water they give you little tumblers and they end up looking like apple juice glasses but you know theres a tiny bit of alcohol in there we mulled over the cartoon menu and everything looked foreign to me honestly i cant bring myself to stomach of the menu but it is pretty fun and i like that young people are so willing to eat various pieces of organs and innards as well as zoo animals look they have frog i tell the french menthe french men tell me that neither of them have ever had frog before and that it is a misconception that all french people eat frog really now i am not so sure that i was even with french men that night turkey testicles i scream out no one wants turkey testicles the waitress walked past us carrying a tray of fried frog spread eagle much like the nekkid women on the wall the frog reminds me of grade biology class and i slightly gag our snacks consist of french fries because i was with french men and they misread my telepathic messages about pommes frites around the corner gyoza and fried chicken without bones we became sufficiently full and the pitcher was emptied the waitress asked for our pitcher and through a miscommunication french man orders another pitcher of beer this delays cotton candy time for another half hour when we decide it is finally time to go french mans check sounds like chicken we pray that the waitress doesnt give us another round of chicken we just want cotton candy and the billthe cotton candy turned out to be oodles of fun and by far the best part of kenka there is no adult supervision and wow that spun sugar can get wild i am barely tall enough to stare into the machine but i do so on my tippy toes and i had a hell of a time turning my chopstick into a ball of dissolving pink fluffon a sidenote kenka has a wall of pachinko machines its just like tao in regards to pachinko in the bathroom in essence kenka is like a playground for immature young adults who enjoy feasting on fried food gross factor beer porn and candy
caf√©s in nyc may be a dime a dozen but ill end my search here late hours check friendly staff check eclectic crowd checkcomfortable environment check good and reasonably priced food check check check a nibble of tiramisu first wash it down with a sip of freshly made americano breathe relax and take in the surroundings with a glance at the next table a street artist proclaims his plans to be in a museum one day suddenly a group of notentirelysober students enters loudly searching for an early hangover cure under the shelter of the covered outdoor dining section an elderly couple smiles and shares secret whispers my mind could and does wander for hours in this manner perhaps its a good thing they arent open on the weekends anymore if it werent for their new closing time of am theyd be hard pressed to remove me from my comfortable windowside nook oblivious to the outside world for just a few more hours
i dont know where i am but ive been here before the patio is serene and darkened a comfortable canopy of grape tendrils gives cover a lazy fan laps breeze into your cheeks the decemberists are playing in the background a bite of creamy burrata complimented by the sweet and tang of a lightly marinated salad of strawberries and peaches taste like summer i could be at any great restaurant back patio in the world but im right here in williamsburgim in the middle of a thought provoking meal at traif a newish restaurant that judging by the light crowd on a friday night hasnt gained traction with the locals quite yet food and service like this and i suspect that will soon changelightly fried sweet breads complimented by the earthiness of artichokes and maitake mushrooms make me wonder why all restaurants other than traif tend to overbatter and overcook their sweet breads im also guiltily struck at how much sweet breads are reminiscent of chicken mcnuggets which is maybe why theyre so enjoyablean earthy and unctuous plate of tender sauteed broccoli rabe on a bed of portabella bechemel and topped with an over easy egg could convert me into a full time vegetarian i dont miss meat at all with this dish a competently done cockle and conchiglie pasta mounted with butter flecked with truffle oil and spiked with jalapenos tastes much lighter and cleaner than the sum of its parts i also wonder why traif which is decidedly nonitalian is running circles around most italian restaurants pastaa dessert of brown sugar budino a delicious but complicated palette of reserved notes chocolate sweet and saltiness caused my palate to wildly reach for approximations where have i had this flavor profile before caramel corn at the county fair chocolate mousse at robuchon where i cant make up my mind but i know this budino is damn tastythe food is on point the wine is flowing and the final bill is too good too be true im struck at how good the food is how modestly its priced and wonder why all restaurants cant figure out this formula maybe im not at any restaurants back patio in the world im right here at traif
what an adorable little old fashioned ice cream parlor the service was beyond friendly with free tastings offered the menu small but rich in possibility and seating tight but available if someone had simply handed me a scoop of ice cream from here i would never have guessed that it was dairy free the mint chocolate cookie was out of this world made with real peppermint instead of a vaguely minty synthetic flavored neon green substance and cashew milk which lent it all of the creaminess and structure of its dairy counterpart doused in gooey hot fudge sauce and served in a little glass dish this was truly a perfect dessert in fact i like this ice cream shop better than blue marble cones the chinatown ice cream factory and the brooklyn ice cream factory

ive been going to riodizios once per year with my family for as long as i can remember this is by far the best riodizio i have ever been to never have i felt that spending this kind of money is more worth it the only caveat is you must bring your appetite i want to rate each thing i tried there in a list fashion because thats pretty much the best way to rate riodizios since you try everything the first thing to note about this place is that its really not hard to get a reservation i called the night before and we were able to secure a table for people and when we arrived we were seated instantly the atmosphere was classy yet not too ostentatious there are also giant windows overlooking the street so it doesnt feel stuffy at all the atmosphere is so important in this review because often these costly churrascarias can be in an overly elegant and uncomfortable place but riodizio tribeca avoided that and in my opinion has created a perfect balance between elegance and comfort without it getting too crazy or crowded the drinks assuming you are over you must try the caipirinha drink ive been having these in miami and in latin american countries for a long time and this one is done right im not sure of all the ingredients but i know they use cashasa pitu rum and the drink is phenomenal i had planned on only getting but ended up being a more beneficial number to methe salad bar at churrascarias the salad bar is somewhat incidental to the actual meat that youre about to enjoy it is crucial that the place has a good salad bar however because you want some light tastes entering your stomach before you get on to the meats it kind of lightly introduces your stomach to the concept of digestion so that its ready for the challenge ahead they had a good selection of light salads sushis side dishes and fruits the tomatoes were fresh which is good because studies show that if you eat tomatoes before during and after you eat steak it helps your stomach digest the steak since tomatoes have a high amount of digestive enzymes the side dishes the side dishes are a doubleedged sword because some of the side dishes can taste truly incredible yet the entire idea behind the side dishes is to load your body up with carbs so that its difficult to eat a large amount of steak thats why i recommend only tasting the side dishes sparingly when needed but saving the bulk of your appetite for the meat the mashed potatoes were out of this word and so were the cheese breads and the french fries but you can get all these things at other restaurants for cheap so concentrate on the meat the meat i recommend you always ask them for a rare piece of steak if you can you will always get the tastiest and juiciest cut that waypicahna steak a picahna is the quintessential musthave meat at riodizios its one of the best they have its salty juicy and flavorful this one is done well they may call it sirloin to you fyi prime rib a i havent usually encountered such good prime rib at riodizios this was really a surprise i think it was even juicer and tastier than the picahna you must try this garlic steak awhat an incredible and unreproducible treat the way they were able to infuse such a strong and unrepentant garlic taste without sacrificing the flavors of the meat itself is a feat among feats skirt steak ba very good steak that is wellsalted and flavorful but falls short of the others i only recommend trying one piece of this and focusing on the above filet mignon wrapped in bacon bdont use up your valuable appetite on this the bacon is a compensatory way to make up for the fact that filet mignons tend to have less fat and therefore less flavor chicken aextremely flavorful this is the chicken that alters the paradigm for chickens everywhere so juicy and perfect although its fantastic i wouldnt recommend getting too many because your appetite will float away quickly sausage ajust like the chicken its something you should definitely try but not in copious amounts the sausages are thick and juicy and are pretty much as good or better as most riodizios pork ribs aanother dish to try sparingly but its very goodbeef ribs ai was completely blown away by these beef ribs i typically dont like beef ribs at riodizios because theyre lacking in flavor but these could be the best part of the meal along with the picahna and the prime riblamb a another complete surprise coming out of left field i love lamb but usually in middle eastern settings this is the first riodizio ive been to that makes the lamb taste just as good as the steaks you are tryingdessert get the brazilian quinji coconut custard its an absolutely breathtaking way to close this meal out its soft its sweet its a taste that everyone can relate to
a tree may grow in brooklyn but theres a garden that overlooks the hudson river and the palisades in the bronx there are chairs scattered about the grounds perfect for quiet reading and reflecting the woodland trail is a great place to walk with someone and maybe even smack them up a bit if theyve been getting on your nerves its quiet and w the trees itll muffle out the crying my favorite part was the aquatic garden sitting on a bench and watching the fish swim by what a lovely garden its a beautiful place for a wedding
i had this on my places to visit list for several months now and once i finally experienced my first jim lahey co bread experience im now a believer of the hype around this bakery and their wonderful bread its a bit of a walk from my apartment but i went to the end of nowhere ave and was greeted by a warm inviting little bakery smelling of fresh out of the oven treats the smell was intoxicating its exactly what i want to smell every morning when i get out of bed that and bacon but i cant have it all can i sunshine was streaming inside through their glass windows and i saw several different newspapers scattered across their wooden booths i fell in love instantly after a few minutes of perusing and taking in the all the glory of this place i immediately ordered the pizza funghi a bombolino with vanilla custard and a savory brioche with gruyere and pancetta and i thought the smell was arousing the taste even better the bombolino bread was soft and still chewy while a little burst of vanilla custard oozed out i wish they filled it more with custard but there was a good balance between the filling and the outside the pizza funghi was covered with slightly browned mushrooms and baked on a thin crust its a relatively small slice and meant to be eaten as a snack or i think so its not warm as you would expect it to be but it was still quite satisfying oh and the brioche with gruyere and pancetta was fantastic the saltiness of the pork and cheese went perfectly with the sweetness of the brioche bread love lovenext time if i can make it out way west again i will be back to try their banana bread pudding that was calling out my name last time but i could sense the judging eyes of the people behind me i will eat you soon banana bread pudding till then wait for me
i dont know about your home town botanical garden but i really love this one i have been here at least once a year and seen different trees and plants at its bloom in season it is just beautiful and great for relaxing and wondering around unless go you to one of the festival days where its packed with other visitorsentrance tickets arent expensive and i find it more than reasonable since this is a huge place and they maintain it well the admission price is half if you have your student id or free if you are a pratt student if you know anyone you can drag them with you and get in for free too the only downside is that the fooddrinks vendors are pricey but thats not a surprisei really like the indoor greenhouses because you get to see these amazing looking plants and of course the rose garden everybody seems to love the japanese pond but it doesnt do anything for me maybe because im jadedi recommend you to check out the website to see what is in season or what section might be under construction or maintenance also there might be some educational activities going on which happens frequentlybtw this can be a nice and safe lol daytime date place just make sure you or the girl dont come in high heels because youll be walking around a lot
having lived in the south floridamiami area for almost years i thought i knew everything there is to know about the perfect cuban sandwich cubano sweet cuban bread mustard mayo pork cheese ham and pickles pretty easy yet of restaurants who try to perfect a cubano still have no idea what theyre doing but somehow i was able to find the best cubano in the most unlikely of places new york citymilanes restaurant is located on st between and ave closer to the burgundy awning outside is what i look for whenever i cant tell which door to walk up to you walk in and right away you get greeted in spanish no matter what you look like this to me is just one of my stamps of approval legitimacy for on special you get a cubano and a drink i sat up at the bar both times to talk food with the owner once again a bobby flay recommended spot featured on throwdown does not dissappoint not at all now on to the foodevery aspect of this cubano is perfect its nice when most of the flavor does not come from the mayo mustard and cheese but from the meats instead the pork on this cubano is definitely the best tasting pork ive had on a cuban sandwich it is juicy tender and so flavorful the meat actually drips sometimes although not messy the bread is perfectly pressed and toasted the pickles are sweet and thicklycut adds great texture to the sandwich the cheese stretches and pulls with every bite you take the sandwich is seriously perfect better than any ive had in miamialthough i have not tried a cubano in cuba due to obvious reasons i assume this would blow most of those away as well it does not matter which country this pork is cooked in its just the best i crave this sandwichs delicious flavor all the time after coming here and it was even better the second timethis dominican joint also serves up any other dishes you might assume they would all for very cheap prices they close at so dont try having a late dinner therefor those of us who have been searching for legit delicious and cheap spanishdominican food look no further milanes has what i think is the best cuban sandwich thank you for the recommendation mr flay

forgive me for giving the brandspanking new and very green battery park city library five stars simply for existing i had heard some rumblings awhile back about a library being built in the neighborhood but then didnt keep breast of updates i didnt even realize where the library was going to be until i heard on that the grand opening was today damn i really should read my bpc broadsheet from now oni of course hightailed it to the library to check out the new digs its in a prime location across the street from the movie theater and embassy suites and a few short blocks from all the local schools best of all i dont have to cross the highway to get to my nearest library goodbye new amsterdam branch hello bpc branch having grown up in this neighborhood and lived here for so long it makes me really happy that this new generation of kids will have such a wonderful resource available to them within the bounds of battery park cityapparently its the greenest library in the city with all kinds of environmentally friendly technology in use its square feet and two floors there are tons of tables with plugs built into them plus lots of other chairs for reading according to the website there are public access computers but it didnt look like that many to me perhaps more will be on the second floor where the multipurpose room is situated right now it looks like they still need to expand their collection the shelves on the first floor are not nearly brimming full enough of books and theres only a magazine section on the second floor but im sure the nypls shrinking budget has something to do with this there is a large childrens section though and lots of dvds movies tv shows anime to choose from i may very well cancel my netflix account if its this convenient to rent movies in my own neighborhoodim also very excited to have such a beautiful local library to use as a writing spot free wifi and a clean quiet welllit environment with a view what else could i ask for best of all i dont have to buy anything to use the space and i wont reek of coffee for hours afterwards i think im in love and if you live in battery park city im sure you will be too

perhaps because of the fact that its expensive packed requires a long wait and there is a bouncer in front people have been comparing an evening at minetta tavern to an evening at a nightclub the restaurant has been in existence for years but keith mcnally took over the space revamped the menu and filled it with socialites fashion editors and whoever else is fortunate enough to get a direct line to mr mcnally for a reservation similar to the waverly inn if you want a table between and i was reluctant to go at first because places with this kind of buzz usually serves sub par food but when frank bruni awarded this place with a three star review i had to go i was lucky enough to get a reservation at a decent time and decided to give this place a trywe walked into the noisy crowded fauxspeakeasy and were directed to the bar the bartenders were very skilled in their craft and served us some potent cocktails we were escorted to our seats as soon as we finished our first drink the server was very accommodating and gave us time to figure out what we wanted we started with the roasted bone marrow which was tasty ive never tried bone marrow so i have nothing to compare it to i decided to go with the pasta zsa zsa but the real star of the show is black label burger which is made with dryaged pat la frieda beef i initially did not want to try the burger because of the caramelized onion topping but it made it taste better i honestly have to say that its the best burger in the city i was very satisfied with our meal we spotted jude law sitting a few tables across from us as i left and shook the bouncers hand i began to think about why people have saying that restaurants are the new nightlife after waiting drinking spotting a celebrity in a packed room and spending a lot of money it began to make sense ps granted reservations are hard to come by they do allow you to order food at the bar

blue hill served me an absolutely fabulous meal replete with some of the freshest ingredients i ever tasted this observation is counterbalanced by the fact that blue hill has the slowest service of the more than michelin starred restaurants i have been to in the city fortunately enough for blue hill the food is worth the wait our table of six was split evenly between partaking in that evenings tasting menu or ordering a la carte it was with great fortune that blue hill will allow both types of service at the same table a rarity i opted for the course tasting menu along with wine pairings amuse bouche a rack of baby spring vegetables with greens attached whimsical folksy and delicious adorned only with salt these vegetables were excellent and obviously freshly picked the signal was clear for what lied ahead amuse bouche bread first served with butter seemingly freshly churned and then again later with a selection of powders and spread functional but not particularly specialthe waitress then visited our table and informed us that the first course of sea bass had run out one of the three of us would have to settle for cobia we all looked distrustfully at each other and asked to share the sea bass instead the request went unheeded and i wound up with the sea bass and a complimentary glass of rose from the loire valley this was probably because i was the only one doing the wine pairing first course looks at watch we are hour in at this point the much touted sea bass served with ramps green garlic littleneck clams and squid ink pasta a perfect dish the sea bass was perfectly cooked with lovely texture delicious the ramps were in season and especially tasty the green garlic had an important note in the dish and the clams were great the squid ink pasta was served as a handful of bowties so soft so lovely what a resounding start second course blue hill farm egg served with dandelion greens pancetta and stone barns spinach the egg was resplendent it was centrally perched with arms of dandelion greens emanating from it along the plate the pancetta added a surprising note of heat to the dish the egg was so beautiful i didnt want to break the yolk breaking the yolk though brought the components of the dish together and it worked wonderfully again another successthird course farmers cross pig served with grilled asparagus pickled ramps and hazelnuts the ramps while a repeat ingredient were welcomed due to their inherent freshness the pig boasted a lovely color and was remarkably tender so delicious the hazelnuts served as a simple adornment atop the pig to the side the two spears of asparagus were placed as an x and there was the bonus inclusion of pork belly pork belly i was in heaven another lovely dishfourth course notices watch we are hours in at this point with the service so noticeably slow the kitchen provided this course to all six members of the table rather than just the three who ordered the tasting menu the course was rhubarb and lemon thyme soup served with a fromage blanc sorbet i know it sounds dubious and i never intentionally ordered rhubarb before too bad because the dish worked and rhubarb can be quite good when it is fresh the course worked well as a palate cleanser and boasted a refreshing clean flavor fifth course flourless chocolate cake served with chocolate rum cream and cocoa nib ice cream again this sounded dubious and again i was wrong yes another great dish i will spare further words of praiseall of the wine selections worked especially well i was even pleased to have a lovely dessert wine at the low price point this was probably the best wine pairing in the city a much better bargain than ordering individually we asked for the bill and wound everything up after hours of service we were the last table left in the restaurant so we literally closed the place down leaving at on a monday night was a bit more than anyone bargained for clearly there was a problem or three in the kitchen but i am happy to report that the food did not suffer in the least as a result what was so remarkably special about this meal was the simplicity of the effort and the high quality of the ingredients the chef has a sure hand and can quickly sum up what adds to a dish and what detracts from it the farm fresh ingredients are the backdrop that makes every dish pop and stand memorable it is a lament that we can not all eat like this every day highly recommend
when people think of the best pizza in new york immediately people tend to think of places in brooklyn or manhattan and maybe the bronx very rarely will people consider queens but if it were true then rizzos would be the q boroughs finest representativetruth is its hard to give them any less than stars throughout all of my experiences their pies are fantastic and the service is unparalleled i would go as far as to say the customer service is the best ive ever dealt within any pizza joint in the boroughs ive ordered this pizza from all over in astoria steinway long island city and sunnyside and even when we were out of delivery range rizzos still managed to make an exception for us they genuinely care about the quality of every pie that leaves their kitchen and take great measures to ensure they arrive in perfect condition shockingly they have offered me a refund during times at which they had the wrong topping or when i was incorrectly charged its hard not to be impressed with the level of service they exhibit for every customer and every pie they have even called me on occasion to see that everything went smoothly they specialize in thin crust pizza with both neapolitan and sicilian styles the special combinations are all good but my favorites have to be the all meat combo or the spinach garlic and what is it with that sauce its smooth in texture with just a bit of tart while lacking the gooeyness the cheese is just right not too overwhelming and complements the rest of the ingredients nicelydelivery is decent though they will give you an honest assessment in that most deliveries will take at least minutes during their busiest times it can take as much as an hour hence keep the orders simple and the appetites at bay credit cards are accepted here and the prices are reasonable especially given the sizes of their pies similar to spumoni gardens these babies might require people at minimum to finishultimately it doesnt take much to recognize why these guys are on top of their game when all cylinders are clicking for them rizzos deserves to be in the conversation of the best pizza in new york if not theyre easily the best in queens

with the notoriety rendered upon the majestic proprietorship over pizza in both manhattan brooklyn one would question why such offerings are not more highly acclaimed on a little road called arthur avenue in the bronx from the ramblings of my fellow compatriots a restaurant located on arthur avenue that simply goes by the name restaurant is known to serve one of the most humbling and delicious renditions of neapolitan pizza in all of the five boroughs for those of us whom have been privy to this find the restaurant is better known as trattoria zero otto nove or restaurant in italianthe setting to describe the interior confines of trattoria zero otto nove would be doing it an injustice the decor is best observed first hand at first entry patrons are in the main bar area of the establishment the modest decorations ranging from solid red tiled floors and walls gives this segment of the establishment a relaxed feel immediately after being escorted through the bar is the true marvel of the edifice the foot tunneled walk into the main dining room possesses a secretive and tranquil feel from the lightly stained sand color rugged brick walls to jagged wooden oak stained doors housing the lavatories the interior confines immediate produces a feeling of minimalism grace upon immediate entry to the main dining room is where the true spectacle of trattoria zero otto noves architectural genius comes to light from initial observation patrons will find that the decorative art painted on the walls depict scenes of italian villas and daily neighborhood activities the natural light from the clear glass roof opening allows for a candid yet serene feel to the main dining area for those dining at trattoria zero otto nove the decor of the establishment renders feelings of relaxation and subtlety thus mirroring the tranquil feel to those experienced in mainland italydespite the appreciation to the attention and detailed rendered to the design of the establishment rachel i are here for the pizzapizza margherita simplistic in its design is the classic margherita pizza containing san marzano tomatoes fresh buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil the presentation of the dish mirrors all other renditions previously consumed what should be noted about trattiorias rendition of this naples classic are the aromatics stemming from this concoction from first scent patrons will discover a hearty and robust flavor stemming from the san marzano tomatoes a secondary note of buttery sweetness is detected from the buffalo mozzarella at first bite patrons will be privy to an explicit flavor profile thats comparable to many but far exceeds anything ever consumed the first notable detection is the slightly charred foundation of the pizza the protrusion of subtle sweetness yet savory bite of the san marzano tomato sauce are greatly subdued yet amplified but the rich and delicate flavor of the buffalo mozzarella patrons will find that the exertion of both sweetness and bold savory properties to work in conjunction with both the san marzano tomato sauce buffalo mozzarella although the fresh basil was slight in the application the subtle hints of vulgarity derived from the refreshing properties allowed for the pungent flavors of the margherita to truly amplifypizza caprese contrary to the exquisite and exceedingly complex flavors of the margherita the caprese embodies a subtle yet well balanced flavor profile the aromatic base of the application is best described as refreshing and earthy with little notes of spice and boldness detected from the shaved parmigiano reggiano at first bite patrons will discover that the heartiness embodied within the margherita isnt present with this rendition but rather a subtle delicate and earthy presence with a strong bitterness derived from the arugula thats complemented by the sweetness of the perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes the pizza itself is transformed to a rendition that embodies a cleansing property when consumed the slight application of the buffalo mozzarella provided the much welcomed buttery sweetness that amplified the earthy flavors of both the arugula and cherry tomatoes ultimately the caprese pizza embodies the true earthiness and complex flavors of the ingredients used in the application although lacking the true heartiness of a san marzano rich application the capreses embodies simplicity which helps to amplify the natural sweetness and delicacy of the ingredients used in the applicationwhat pizzaiolo robert paciullo embodies with his creative rendition is that of exquisite perfection thats complemented by the exceedingly impressive flavor base for those venturing to arthur avenue trattoria zero otto nove is a must visit such perfection must be sought

located on a very scenic part of coney island avenue this turkish cafe sells freshly made baklava and what brought me here in the first place chewy ice creamthats right after attending the secret science club a few weeks i learned from nyu chemist kent kirshenbaum and chef will goldfarb about an ice cream made in turkey that stretches this ice cream is made from the root of maras although the plant is protected apparently this ice cream is a very popular snack in turkeygulluoglu came up in a quick google search and so off we were my gf and i on a mission to try chewy ice creamgulluoglu which has been around in turkey since and has more than locations in istanbul alone is mainly a baklava bakery and their ice cream is imported from turkey too bad it is not made on the premises because ive heard that people can make some pretty funny tricks with this ice cream when they serve it oh well next time im in istambul i guesson a saturday afternoon the place was deserted except for two men watching turkish soccer on a flat screen tv vh and i sat by the fire place and just relaxed while eating our ice creamthe ice cream gr vanilla is the only flavor available is of a very pearly white color with sprinkled pistachio on top it is served with a knife and you do need a knife to cut it the result is a very tasty ice cream with an incredible consistency and texture unlike anything ive tried think taffy that bites you backthis place is very nice and i would definitely recommend it not just for the ice cream but for the wonderful pastries as well we sampled some of their baklava and they were all excellent crisp and not sticky lots of flavor without the overwhelming sweetness that you sometime get with baklava moreover each different baklava have different consistencies i suggest to give up to curiosity and try a few i particularly liked the one with chestnut inside their savory cookies kuru pasta were also excellent shaped like minipretzels they have a wonderful flaky consistency and come in two flavors with sesame seeds and with anise seedsps it seems that ilili also makes chewy ice cream the bulbs of this wild orchid contain a mucilaginous carbohydrate called glucomannan which the orchids use to retain water during dry periodswhen dissolved in milk the long coiled glucomannan chains bind up and block the movement of water molecules and thicken the milk
if you find yourself in flushing on a frigid windy night theres only one way to warm up stuff your belly with piping hot dumplings and lots of them my friends and i found white bear shuttered on a recent night but i remembered this excellent recommendation by melissa z just around the cornerit took a couple address checks and a rereading of melissas review to verify that yes hiding somewhere beyond the buckets of dried seafood grains and herbs there was a dumpling shop a really excellent dumpling shop that looks just like a showroom kitchenwe took seats at the folding tables surrounding the kitchen and glanced over the menu its not about the usual suspects pork chive or pork cabbage at this place here youll find offbeat numbers like pork fennel mutton or pickled vegetable dumplingswe ordered the vegetable dumplings pork fennel dumplings and spicy wontons singapore spicy dumplings the woman dug through various bags to assemble our order and started boiling the dumplings in the model kitchen while we snacked on a bowl of pickled vegetablesten minutes later the dumplings hit the table the pork and fennel dumplings were fantastic and unusual though as one other reviewer said fennel may be a bad translation for dill and the spicy wontons were exceptional perfectly acceptable standins for the soft spicy pillows served up at white bear the vegetable dumplings were tasty but not my top pick next time the muttonjust after we finished eating we settled up and the woman closed up shop dragging a metal grate down the shopkeepers smiled as they showed us the door and as soon as it had begun the dumpling fantasy was over and the kitchen had disappeared out into the night we went bellies bracing us against the wind
afterwards we sat quietly in the car trying to process what had just happened it was equal parts bliss and confusion as endorphins took over the neural circuitry wow that has to be the best ive had in my life breathless i could only nod in agreement months cities coast to coast trials nope not the search for the american idol but for the ideal cannoli finally a clear winner villabate i may be a tough judge but i prefer critique over easy laughs even while awarding stars to madonia bakery i had noted that the cannolo shell added nothing to the taste here at villabate one can appreciate that a good shell needs no embellishment or protection from a chocolate coating it is tasteful and texturally correct on its own neither soggy nor too flaky or thickcookie like and the sheeps milk ricotta imported from palermo italy is the most delicious ive ever had as a result the cannolo is creamy crunchy and has an explosion of flavors it also has an element of mystery is mascarpone used in combination with the ricottavillabate is named after the town in sicily that is home to the family that runs it it reminds one of the best that italy has to offer beauty art friendly people and excellent food the kind of place you fall spectacularly hopelessly and permanently in love with but it wasnt love at first sight the first time i was here at andy hs recommendation after a review update i had tried a few pastries and left unconvinced as one could also taste the essence not just the fruit but on my subsequent visits as i tried a host of items ranging from nocciola fruit marzipan cheesecake seven layer cookies chocolate spice cookie macaroons spumoni better than the one at lb i appreciated flourishes of genius in each they do mix up fillings really well and so one can expect to find mousse ricotta cream custard zabaglione vanilla rum etc in the vast selection of pastries while there are lots of beautiful and colorful cakes around my favorite would be la cassata siciliana made with sweet sponge cannoli cream and a marzipan shell topped with jellied fruitsvillabate is well known to discerning people on christmas eve there was a wait for an hour and a half just to get served and none of the patrons looked as if they had mistaken bensonhurst for times square or were holding a map theyve been shopping here for years and most are greeted and served in italian i used to come here when it was famous as alba pastry shop but the villabate folks were so good they drove alba out of business said the woman standing behind methat comment speaks volumes not only are these guys so good that they overcame a legendary competitor but are also courteous to have retained the goodwill of the customers truly if you were to wake me up in the middle of the night and ask me which nyc bakeries would be leaders in service courtesy efficiency knowledge helpfulness the two that would come to mind are madonia and villabatethe location is perhaps the only thing which prevents me from visiting on a more frequent basis but that too has its advantages in terms of wallet friendliness villabate has a minimum for credit card purchases and honestly just to meet that minimum i have had to keep on buying more pastries when i got home and looked at my receipt for pastries i realized that most ranged between which would be half of what comparable pastries would cost in manhattanthose of you disappointed by the missing obligatory cinematic reference in a cannoli review might want to visit around easter as there will be blood in the sanguinaccio chocolate pudding with fresh pig blood whoever thought eating chocolate pudding could be an adventure eh
di faras i love i love i loveit inspires me to new heights of craziness in my food eating adventures ive been going on and off since my first time as a wide eyed gawking tourist from canada i brought my boyfriend he sat and waited at a table doing a slow burn while i held our place in line all the while soaking in the theatrics of a true pizzaiolo since that virgin visit ive returned a couple of times each year enough to have the q train schedule burned into my memory enough to endure hour long subway rides back and forth enough to know that i should bring a tolstoy tome to pass the time between commute and pizza making a couple of years ago i ventured out and i made the sore mistake of not calling beforehand so i braved freezing temperatures and a windy snow storm only to arrive at a closed storefront arrgghh so i was on a di faras hiatus for the last two years enough with the erratic hours and the gongshow waits i thought time to move on although i could never help but wonder when i would make my next return to my own personal pizza mecca i went back this past week seizing the great snowstorm of february as a capital pizza eating opportunity and yes i called beforehand the place is as charmingly worn down as it was before with a fresh lick of green paint inside and dom the septuagenarian pizza maestro is still sporting the same worn plaid shirt and cap churning out pies effortlessly maggie his wry daughter mans the counter and tries to keep the crowds in check with her expediting i had a minute wait for a pie this visit but other visits ive waited upwards of an hour and half to two hours so yeah dont go on the weekends or prime dinnertime its a zoo and it requires all the patience and zen of a jedi master to endure the madness like luke youll find yourself tempted by the dark side when others most likely the uninitiated or uncouth cut in front or steal a pizza out of turn only to have your eyes cut into their backs like daggers but the pizza here is first rate in my books yes its not true authentic neapolitan style neither pliable or fluffy soft in its dough tender chewy crisp is more appropriate the thin crust barely strong enough to support the dynamite melange of cheese on top added extra virgin olive oil almost gilds the lily a dangerous pool of cheese and oil if dom is extra generous with the oil the dough groans to support the embarrassment of riches like strippers at a frat boy party oil cheese and more oil sometimes youll get a pie with a sheen not unlike a pimply teenager from fat city its a flavorful greasy mess though not for everyone the tomato sauce is suitably herbaceous and sweet and the dusting of grana padano on top lends a sweet nuttiness to the mozz below finally a sprinkle of the specially imported basil gives a nice verdant freshness to each pie i couldnt imagine having a slice without some of that good stuff so yes lots of love for this pizza despite all the pains i love i love i love

dear waitress nataliewhy must you scold me so for using my iphone at the table dont you realize im addicted to pizza and need to tell the world via yelp app of course that i was in midlucali bingeand then to make matters worse you presented me with of all things the bill you clearly just like to kick me when im down midpostpizza coma that is just wrong and whats worse is i think you kind of enjoyed itwell truth be told natalie was quite fetching brought us glasses for our byo and recommended the spicy sausage as a substitute for the pepperoni that was not available she also gave us the dl on her upcoming trip to exotic locations poland and ibiza among others and gave me all name and manner of grief despite my overwhelming charm and good looks ah yes the waitresses are indeed engaging despite a review or two to the contrary but as to the nitty lets talk about roberto bs review for a secondmy good man you cant be serious you could possibly have walked around nyc seen the manifold insipid lifeless flaccid uninspired and unappealing pizza offerings and somehow after sinking your teeth into a slice of this pie say with a straight face that its just good totally acceptable but not great pshaw your credibility is now officially nil despite your vehement declarations of intimate knowledge of the etymology and origin of all things pizza ha your review should indeed be dismissed as you suggested it might beoh and did you actually comment on the demeanor of the waitresses you want mark to smile when hes making the pies would that make you feel better about the pizza tell me youre joking pretty pleasei mean perhaps you came on a bad night i dont know in any event you clearly are not from around these here parts from what i can tell growing up here it was pretty much accepted that if you came out of a restaurant not feeling like the waitress had spit in your food you really hadnt been to new york city at all this kinder gentler noo yawk stuff has got to go get the faaaaaaaahhhk over yourself waitno espresso you poor thing how will you survive would you even deign to make the same comment about di fara they have no espresso machine at all off off off with their heads i saylets stick to the facts about this pizzait was absolutely fantastico the crust was crispy and the flavor confluence from the cheeses was enough to keep me sitting and eating pizza until underverse come translation a long freakin time according to riddick the only slight complaint i would lodge is that the basil should be spread across the pie and even shredded and it isnt in a manner more akin to methodology of the proprietors mentor dom dimarco the basil is an important flavor component and should be experienced on every slice in truth thats just a small complaint about a pie that pays serious homage to a great pizza and yet succeeds at being just a little different at the same time among the notable differences the crust is crispier and holds up better under the weight of the ingredients than the di fara pizza i dont mind a slightly less resilient crust myself but im just sayin we had spicy sausage and garlic on our pie and it was savory tangy and spectacular i am looking forward to a return visit for a different variety of pie and a heaping helping of grief from natalie i imagine ill have to wait until shes back from her world travels for that but im sure itll be worth ithey roberto eh quit breakin freakin bawls ovah heeeyaah go back to ohio or wherever da faaahk you came from geeesh
everything from first dates to taking out friends to having your girlfriend meet your parents for the first time oh shizer arturos serves as the perfect backdrop for almost any culinary occasioni know nyc is known for pizza and its pretty hard to give any place the five stars as everyone has their own favorites and thus many places would receive at least a four but i think the fifth star can most definitely be earned through intangibles such as amiable hosting splendid seating and an uncanny skill of waiting on tables live jazz every sunday night and possibly during the weekdays a vibrant environment which all help to produce a phenomenal atmosphere arturos does this impeccably because it is so popular your average wait time will directly correlate depending upon your party size theres plenty of twoseaters but not too many spots to seat a party of five or six patience is always rewarded here ive gotten the large arturos fiesta almost every time and have never been disappointed sausage peppers onions classic you should obviously come hungry to starving but if you arent or maybe even full from something else once you see the gleaming pie of melted mozzarella and marinara goodness no one can resist not even you yoga ladyat times it can get pretty loud actually its loud all the time but you can still hear the person sitting across from you however if they lose your attention and you dont really want to listen just let the grand piano and the accompanying basssaxophonevocalist flood your attention span its also perfect for preventing potentially awkward silent social situations whether it be with coworkers that you dont really want to listen to anymore or friends who have all of sudden become obnoxiously annoying or just in case your girlfriend andor parents have ceased their conversations with each other let the music take you away that and the pizza oh mah gaw that pizza
as two whitelookingbutchuntiat heart kids from la puente ca my hubs and i were worried when we ventured into the world of brooklyn mexican food los hermanos put our fears to rest a nice cheesy chorizofilled rest their chorizo tacos and quesadillas are quickly becoming staples in our diets as are bottles of red jarritos and mexican bottled coke the menu items are also contributing to our affection for the place lunch here for the both of us never costs more than the place only takes cash which is a bummer but they do have an atm machine to help facilitate your taco dreams we were a bit confounded with the place order eat then pay part of the transaction as the taco joints back home demand payment before letting you rip into their ambrosial offerings but hey we are adapting
bacon mushroom swiss burgersuch a great balance of flavors in this one little burgerits been a while since ive feasted on a burger my friends coaxed karaoke preceded by dinner at the stand i was hesitant with karaoke but i was sold on the standyou see im a terrible singer offkey miss the cues dont know the lyrics tempo or beats etc however stand has built up a great reputation for its burgers with notable mentions in time out and new yorker on unaccountable occasions i knew all about them i just hadnt had the opportunity to try them out as yet well opportunity came knockin on my door that day meat was perfectly chargrilled mediumrare over an open flame as witnessed through their open kitchen layout bacon was crispy smoky and bacony sp it was good bun was a tad tough it was reluctant to squish when i chomped down for my bite you see i dont like resistance when im feasting on a burger hmpf swiss cheese held it all togetherheres a tip use the sauce they give you from the fried pickles on the burger throw it on the burger its a sweet tangy sauce that pairs up so well with the burgerthe fries were too skinny and too crispy they were more crispy fried than they were potatoflavored sadthe fried pickles were cute at best the dipping sauce made a better impression on me then the pickles if i could id take a bottle of the dipping sauce to goive read of the legendary toasted marshmallow shake i ordered one and then i ordered a second
i licked the plates clean well i would have if i could get away with doing such a thing without being branded a barbarian the food was that good the tuscan bean soup was hands down some of the most comforting flavorful and yet surprisingly light soups ive had in a while the bite of kale and the sweetness of the other vegetables tied in the flavor once again if i could have licked the bowl clean i would have i had the duck confit on braised red cabbage and turnips there was nothing but bones and a smear of red from the sauce left on my plate the meal came to a close with the vanilla panna cotta with raspberry sauce it was light luscious and the complement of the tart raspberry sauce was heavenly by the silent concentration of my dining companions i think they had a similar experience to mine with their dishes a lovely meal lovely service and lovely decor apiary lovely as good as it gets

warning this review is mad long you might want to settle down with a nice cup of tea before you start readingwith consistent five star reviews ive been dying to come here ever since i joined yelp and after getting my haircut here this weekend im joining the five star brigade but i didnt always feel this way in fact when i first left the salon i was considering giving this place less than a five star oh the horror lemme splaini walked in and no one really acknowledged me the person at the front desk was on the phone and i was just standing there awkwardly soon enough though someone came and took my coat and asked who i was here to see yadda yadda i had an appointment with tom at but he was running late and we didnt get started until ten minutes later i mean i can understand since they were all very busy but it was kind of a shitty start to something i was super super excited about and had really high hopes for the majority of the haircut experience was by far the best ive ever had toms really smart about hair in ways that i never knew were possible he noticed that my hairs only wavy in some places that it was cut a line that one side of my hair was longer than the other suggested it was bc my last hair stylist was right handed he even showed me his ergonomic scissors it was all going swimmingly until the very end he flat ironed my hair to make sure it was all even awesome but somewhere between then and finished product things got weird i dont really know how it happened something like i asked him to angle it a little more he did a little and asked if i liked it i said i did but then next thing i knew there were too many angles everywhere and my hair looked crazy weird at this point we were already minutes past and his next appointment was waiting for him anyway i walked out feeling not too good about my cut tom suggested that i just wasnt used to it yet and that ill get used to how it looks meeeh skeptical feelings everywhere okay so why am i still joining the five star brigade because tom was right after i went home i unstraightened my hair put back that natural wave i usually have and wow it looked amazingly awesome like amazingly awesome like wow my hair has never looked so good before wowowowow and now the more i check it out and play around with it the more i love it so after a lot of contemplation i decided on a rating because i came here for an awesome haircut and i got exactly that i mean i dont know what else i could ask for and looking back i dont think anyone was excessively rude or anything given the time pressured circumstances so yeah a whistle even if i didnt think so right away o
i generally have scorn for no reservations restaurants in new york city because i am not a year old who enjoys eating dinner at nor am i cool enough to be out at on a school night so when the suggestion of spotted pig on mlk came up i was disdainfulwe grabbed a few beers at the nearby white horse tavern while making bets on college basketball via our smartphones like the degenerate gamblers we are and surprisingly enough the hour wait flew by the reservationist called my boyfriend promptly at one hour later and said we have a table open for twobut its a pretty romantic spot are you a couple or just friends i sort of loved that she asked us this we took the romantic seat which wasn really romantic given youre squished next to other diners on either side of you but at this point we were famished deviled eggs were an obv choice as was the chicken liver toast the eggs were tasty but paled in comparison to the creamy and decadent chicken liver toast heaped with delicious chicken innards this is the stuff culinary dreams are made of even my nonadventurous eater of a boyfriend declared this was the best well only chicken liver toast he had ever consumedwe shared the famous roquefort burger with shoe string fries and we decided to order a side of kale for our greens fortunately for me the kale was drenched in bacon fat fine by me the burger was interesting from a meat perspective it was perfectly juicy and flavorful i did find the roquefort to be a tad overpowering at times spotted pig despite your clunky interior and no reservation policy you and the chicken liver toast will always have a fond place in my heart like a good friends with benefits i will keep coming back

if you have ears youve probably heard that the new york times recently called motorino the best pizza in new york is it true well the long answer is that is like yetis shangrila and poo that dont stink there is no such thing as the best pizza because blah blah blah but the short answer is yesfrom the humble slurry of flour and yeast rises a crisp shell freckled with char and protecting the tender toothsome core of chewy crust as you lift each slice the tip lazily hangs but the topping never abandon ship each morsel of brussel sprout or mozzarella di bufala or pancetta or soppressata finds safe harbor into your masticating mouth the tomato sweet sauce is spread thick under the sparse cheese flaunting its natural earthy subtleness but is never watery never bland i often order the mixed green salad the simple concoction with parsley chives and red onion arrives with a tiny pitcher full of and even tinier portion of balsamic and olive oil emulsion the spicy greens nullify the tart dressing into an aging grape sweetness on the tongue as the mineraly olive oil coats the rest of your mouth not wanting the evening to end when the waitress offered housemade bombolini for dessert we gladly accepted without knowing what they were turns out they are doughnuts one with cream one with raspberry preserves and they taste a lot like well dounuts id skip them and order another pizza for dessertwhat no they dont make dessert pizza yet since when is the sweet serenity of another doc margherita not appropriate for dessert

preface the hair gods were smiling on me so i got everything below for free i had the opportunity to step in as a hair model for an arrojo class for visiting hairdressers taught by nick and some of his team i knew that id need to be openminded in terms letting nick demonstrate the cut he wanted to for the class bring it on ive always been a hair chameleon and hello nicks a visionary aside from his work as a tv personality hes built a thriving empire in the midst of challenging times including a studio a full range of products comprehensive education cosmetology programs and presence on social media channels in other words he can get his hands on my hair anytime of course you probably also know that kreys nothing if not a pushover for bearded flirty foreign men in the service industry so i was done before i stepped in the doors i digressi went in twice the week ahead of my cut first up was a consultation with nick to give him a sense of what my hairs like as opposed to a normal consult in which hed assess what the client wanted next i was booked for complimentary highlights with ashley shes technically a stylist relatively junior in their food chain but nick trusts her and its clear why ashley was precise personable and artful she took her time sectioned my hair and removed the foils shampooed my tresses at different times as she felt they were finished as opposed to all at once highlights and a blow dry with her are approx pretip not cheap but id say shes a great value considering their new hires are selected from an intense month training program so ashley spent more time in nicks school than my husband did getting his mastersid say shes wellqualified finally the day came for the big cut it was quite an experience to be seated in front of a few dozen professionals whod come to watch nick co do their thing i saw several innovative edgy cuts and styles demonstrated most of the talk was way beyond my level of comprehension but ive had fun showing off my undercut bangaliscious bob complete with supershort hidden pieces under longer ones to eliminate bulk and help hair to move better even though they didnt owe me a thing after my hair was styled in a fashionforward way read not appropriate for everyday life nick personally offered to flatiron it during the class break so i could leave with a more wearable style id be confident showing off a man who commands took the time to make sure i mswasntgivingthemadime was pleasedobviously im now predisposed to drink the koolaid but i eyed their clientele during my three visits and saw one contemporary creative style walk out after another and although youll see lots of tattoos tight jeans piercings and outthere looks from the staff everyone was downtoearth and clientfocused if you can book a cut with nick go for it but otherwise rest assured that everyone there is wellequipped to give your look an update and make you feel sensational
i recently had the great privilege to take natasha to daniel bouluds eponymous restaurant to celebrate her birthday the restaurant has recently been promoted in the michelin hierarchy with it now garnering three stars assuring that it is among the very best restaurants in the world in fact by last years rankings in such rarefied air the expectation was that i could stand to do little better than this the elaborate and memorable meal we had more than confirmed this conclusion the meal began with a trio of amuse bouches the theme was cauliflower the tripartite arrangement draped across the center of my fine china plate was visually striking to the left the cauliflower complemented mackerel and to the right it complemented a small bite of shrimp in the middle the cauliflower was made into a small taste of soup that was balanced in texture with a cracker spoon the flavors were delicate and interesting impressive given that i generally do not like cauliflowerfor the first course i had the duo of florida frog legs this was a gamble for me having been quite disappointed in the past with the frog legs at jean georges surely at daniel they would fare better with this preparation indeed the presentation was elaborate and gorgeous two frog leg lollipops flanked either end of an elliptical plate the gulf between was filled in with spinach both fresh and pureed mushrooms and crispy shallot rings the plate was made complete by a tableside serving of two dollops of kamut berries accentuated with black garlic the kamut berries a first for me were simply exceptional an innocuous whole grain these berries took on a prominent role in this dish they were an excellent way to bring a taste of butter to the dish through alternative means the frog legs themselves were not so diminutive here and i found them perfectly prepared further they were nicely accompanied by the earthiness of the mushrooms and fresh burst of green coming from the spinach a perfect dish all around and among my all time favorites for the second course i had the trio of milk fed pig from quebec the trio was comprised of a roasted chop an oblong parallelepiped of ham dotted with romanesco and a squat cube of smoked pork belly all of the proteins were gorgeously prepared my love for pork belly continues and i was pleased with the smokiness of this particular specimen the chop was striking with its delicious meat emanating from the frenched bone and its impressive size dwarfing the pork belly the ham was okay but i did not enjoy the frequent interruption by the romanesco this was more distracting than appetizing generally though this was a solid dish but i would probably be inclined to order differently upon my next visit for dessert i had the warm guanagja chocolate coulant the cake was garnished with a gold leaf and housed delicious liquid caramel a streak of chocolate connected it the far end of the plate where a complementary ellipsoid of milk sorbet could be found simple delicious and a touch of luxury a second dessert was then brought out in natashas honor replete with her name written on the plate in chocolate sorbet confectionary delights and a lone lit candle awaiting the bated breath of a wishful young lady compliments of the chef of course and a lovely way to honor her on this occasion the mignardises were less than substantial here on a small rectangular silver platter we were offered a preselected set of six small bite desserts including macaroons additionally madeleines were offered in addition to the meal we opted for the wine pairing our sommelier was especially friendly and engaging he accentuated the festive nature of our visit and included selections of champagne rose and pinot noir because both of our courses were paired with a pinot noir he even encouraged us to swap glasses midcourse to compare the selection from oregon to the selection from france as it enhanced the flavors in our respective dishes i loved the enthusiasm and the great knowledge he brought to our table all around the service was impeccable and consistent with the very high standards one expects of a three star restaurant the decor was luxurious and grand sitting side by side in our banquette we were afforded a view of the main floor while still remaining aloof across the divider from us our dinner neighbors were none other than howard stern and his wife whether you are a billionaire or a mere mortal hoping to celebrate a special occasion a grand time will be had here highly recommend the three course prixfixe menu is per person and the wine pairing is an additional per person
every time i walk by im mesmerized by the unusual offerings displayed as enigmatically as a mona lisa smile and the mysteries abound waiting to be explored in the past we have purchased fabulous curry and bindi for the unlucky girls when they were youngertoday the main agenda outside was raw turmeric and bitter melon and so a little bito multiple choice quizturmeric can be used to repela antsb pigeonsc laughing hyenasd panhandlersturmeric is aa a sassy freshwater redundant pearlb bark from a budweiser treec bbqd ostrich elbowsd a rhizome turmeric is often used asa a recreational drugb to make yellow colored finger paintsc sneezing powderd to make foodies weep with joy when they eat curryturmeric is also used ina aromatherapyb for even cowgirls when they get the bluesc for odd cowboys when they get the newsd for cobra antivenin apparently turmeric is used for everything from a to z including as a depilatory food colorant as an antibacterial agent in various religious rituals as a spice and it is also being used in medical research for the possibility of it being useful for stomach problems alzheimers and pancreatic cancer as for the warty and homely looking bitter melon thats another story for another day just tips dont eat it when its too ripe because the riper it gets the more bitter it becomes and the red arils can be toxic for kiddies and kiddies in utero
part ii of the evening hangout with srini atif pk involved a venture to a little known cocktail lounge called milk and honeyill start by stated that milk honey is virtually impossible to find having not known it was there one would easily walk by the entrance on three to four occasions before locating its entry way the front door itself blends into that of the neighborhoods thus adding to the allure and mystique of this establishmentupon entry into milk and honey two velvet black curtains need to be surmounting in order to get a glimmer of the interior confines after overcoming the task of wrestling the two heavy velvet curtains the hostess requested our name to confirm the reservation we were seated at a booth immediately past the bartenders stationill start by emphasizing the interior confines of milk honey the initial impression of the establishment is the opaque and menacing nature of the color absent darkness is fueled by the subtle candle lighting patrons at milk and honey will find that the visual perception of the restaurant must be observed from a point blank standpoint walking through milk and honey is also a slight feat the establishment itself is extremely small with a width of approximately feet from wall to wall still the surreal feel of the establishment did add a slight majestic yet tranquility to the atmosphere milk and honey is a cocktail lounge thus cocktails is what the locale should be focuseddrink the business three simple ingredients gin honey lime thats it the drink itself was remarkably refreshing the slight drizzle of honey and lime provided a much welcoming amplification of the heavy bodied gin flavors in the drink what should be emphasized in the remarkable drinkability of the cocktail the smoothness of the consumption process revealed almost no distortion in the ingredientsdrink aviation calvados cassis absinthe lime not sure if either the calvados or cassis is the violet portion of this cocktail but the violet additive helped to italicize the gin flavor of this cocktail generally aviations previously consumed during my tenure have been bold and brash luckily milk and honeys rendition revealed a refined equilibrium of flavors for which a delicate palate enticing sensation was observedtwo drinks nothing to see tons to drink thats the allure of milk and honey and thats all that is i should further emphasize that milk and honey is indeed a cocktail lounge most patrons attending mh are there for cocktails despite the incessant rules and obligations that are mentioned on the website the overall perception of mh is that its a laid back high end cocktail emphasis establishment that those who enjoy a superb cocktail would frequentneedless to say i need to get back in here again
i am standing in line patiently waiting my turn at doughnut plant this past saturday i have been here probably ten times in the past and have loved every second of it savoring the glaze that gets on my fingers well past the appropriate time for licking ones fingers so i am in line and the person behind me is asking her friend about the blackout doughnut and they both dont know what it is i do know what it is and i know i am getting one of those hmm do you see the dilemma here i want to be helpful because i am generally a nice and helpful person but i dont want to tell them how good it is in case they somehow leapfrog me and steal the last one do you see how ridiculous this is this is what you will become on your visit here bewarei have now had virtually all the doughnuts here and have a lovelove relationship with almost all of them however here are the best of the peanut butter and jelly this would probably make my death row plate the contents are so fresh and flavorful that you have to slow yourself from devouring without talking this is the doughnut that when your friend who got a different one asks you how it is you say not that great you should stick to yours it is probably better then you keep shoving the rest of it in your mouth until they cant have any because it is long any vanilla bean with jelly i hate jelly donuts but i would hurt someone for a jelly doughnut the jelly is so tasty and it is complimented so perfectly by the glazed outer realm of the donut that it still perplexes me how much i like this jelly blackout see my prior review for a description chocolate and chocolate with some chocolate on topeverything else coconut creme is good i personally dont like the creme brulee but most other people who i share it with do it is the tiniest of all the doughnuts if the guy ever knows my name here i need to get some help until he does though give me the pbj at any hour cant verify the accuracy of this statement

sometimes a piece of art can take your breath away it can catch you off guard feel a little over indulgent and beg you to dig deeper i ate at the modern and wondered what the chef was thinking how many times could he trick me by making watermelon look like tomato and vice versa how big of a piece of foie gras does one person deserve before it feels sinful does putting pop rocks on dessert make it avant garde my dinner at the modern was amazing the unveiling of each course was a presentation in itself and one that merits the modern with five yelp stars the modern really takes care of you they are all about taking service seriously as i sat near the entrance waiting the hostess checked on me periodically and told me when my friends would be arriving since they had called to say they would be just a tad bit late due to traffic i had coat service where they take offput on your coat and once my friends and i were seated we were treated like royalty the number of people attending to us outnumbered us one apologized to my friend when he blocked his way as he walked to the bathroom and the waiters even gave us ample time to photograph our dishes before explaining to us what they were god forbid they spoke while we were being paparazzi dining at the modern requires patience a meal here could set you back as long as five hours towards the end of our dinner we were rushing to get out of there to make a show what a pity now that i think back on it i really appreciate the experience at the modern its one of luxury that warrants time to be set aside the chef and seasonal tasting menu was more than we could handle between the three of us we had different dishes all of which had decided they wanted to be one of a kind a show piece and so flavorful that they would leave a lasting impression on us we created our own wine pairing and even got half glasses to accompany certain dishes the sommelier was quite friendly extremely knowledgeable and very accessible while a meal at the modern is high class it is definitely not snootythe modern used the finest ingredients in all of its dishes the pictures alone dont do the food justice to sum it up this is what we had amusebouche of palmiers fried lima beans and corn panna cotta w crispy lentils and tapioca in tomato water heirloom tomato terrine with micro basil and spicy tomato sorbet foie gras terrine flavored with juniper marinated raisins pistachio joconde tartare of hamachi yellowfin tuna and watermelon with mirin verjus daikon radish and ginger tartare of yellowfin tuna and diver scallops seasoned with yellowstone river caviar chilled cucumber soup with alaskan king crab ravioli of escargot with slow poached quail eggs escargot caviar and mustard greens halibut in a zucchini blossom with cardamom jus roasted maine lobster with sweet corn baby fennel and basil chorizocrusted codfish with white coco bean pur√©e and harissa oil sullivan county foie gras with fresh peas banana and almond cream black angus beef tenderloin with parsley root pur√©e and lobster mushroom pennsylvania duck breast with black trumpet marmalade fleischschneke and banyuls jus pineapple puree watermelon and cream miniature ice cream cones warm fig tart with balsamic reduction pine nuts and olive oil ice cream macarons truffles pistacio cupcakes espresso chocolates milk chocolate and hazelnut dacquoise with raspberry sorbet buttermilk panna cotta with strawberry soup tomato marmalade and pistachio ice creamis that not over indulgent for three people i tried everything and my favorite was the lobster my least favorite was the foie gras it was the size of a filet mignon a little bit goes a long way in this case i could only eat half the spacing between courses was perfect except at the end when we told them we were in a rush to leave that was when they paused twice as long to give us dessert it was like a punishment for leaving all was forgotten when they gave us surprise miniature vanilla ice cream cones topped with strawberry syrup i near cried tears of joy and my smile was so big you could have thrown the cone in my mouth and i would have swallowed it wholeah the modern frenchamerican cuisine never looked and tasted this good they even gave us parting gifts of pound cake lastly i wont dwell too much on the ill designed coed sterile bathrooms i was not a fan it wasnt pretty and the lighting was not flattering ill stick with the food and service at the modern

ever since i saw oldboy ive been curious what it would be like stuffing a live octopus in my mouth is it as terrifying as it looks in the that curiosity was largely forgotten until i sat down at sik gaek and took a good look at the menu when i saw live octopus i knew we had to try it regardless of market price its not exactly like that terrifying scene in the film because here they serve it neatly chopped and squirming on a bed of lettuce with sliced jalapeno and garlic atop as garnish with a spicy dipping sauce and another of sesame oil salt still the sight of the plate is arrestingit tastes as fresh as youd imagine a wriggling octopus to be and extremely chewy it also feels like youve just eaten something that would make you invincible for a while in a video gamea strangely potent foodbefore going invincible we had eaten the standard starter here three eggs fried in a small oily pan at your table stove which your waiter starts cooking the minute you sit down while we ate this he also brought us four enormous raw clams juicy and delicious after that a seafood pancake i believe the best ive ever had exploding with the fresh flavors of different seafood and vegetableswe followed that with the huge seafood stew get the spicy one with a bubbling red broth stacked high with lobster crabs clams and mussels inside if you dig deep youll find bean sprouts noodles calamari bits of fish rice rolls and some exciting additions like fish ovaries and seasquirts its safe to say im not a fan of the last two but try them at leastwe drank a bottle of cham isul during the meal and afterward one of the waiters brought us a lovely cold cucumber drink a sort of agua fresca korean style i havent mentioned the service but the waitstaff here are the kindest you could wish for everyone was courteous smiling and eager to explain what the stranger ingredients were in the stew and for those reviewers who say the staff speaks only limited english any korean who knows seasquirt could be teaching the language in my opinionanother reason id bump this up to six stars if i could when we first arrived to the packed restaurant someone possibly the owner brought a plate of freshly fried calamari for everyone in the waiting area to snack on it really doesnt get any better than this for korean home cooking all of this for a person
gramercymurray hillkips bay chinese takeout winnerlast night i looked inside my freezer and saw veggie burgers and vegetables galore i decided to blame my next bad decision on my hangover and made a date with some chinese takeout and some snl my roommate suggested i call j east since im kind of loyal to mee noodle i thought twice about it but then decided out with the old and in with the newcan we talk about the specials were going to talk about the specials nowfor like you can get pork fried rice an egg roll kung po chicken or whatever entree youd likeits such a deal and the quality and quantity of chinese delivery cannot be beat its really enough for two people or three meals for me its so delicious that youll want to eat all of it in one sitting though i swear but dont try to have some control although last night after watching joseph gordonlevitt host snl and realizing that hes probably gay and therefore not my future husband i was tempted to go all the way with my chinese takeout but i saved some for today and im glad i did anyway i actually picked up the phone and called my father after consuming all the leftovers today because my experience was almost religious and felt he should know what my happy voice sounds likemenupage it and make it happen theyre not on seamless web
i like sushi but am not a sushi buff and have not been to masa yasuda or some of the other best sushi places in manhattan let alone japan but rarely have i ever had a dining experience like i did with the omakase at jewel bako the fish was fresh the offerings were plentiful and the omakase shattered a few preconceptions i had about eating sushi at a good japanese restaurant preconception you get the same service at the sushi bar that you do at a table wrong following the advice of other yelpers we made sure to get seats at the sushi bar and it was so worth it we watched head chef yoshi carefully craft each piece of sushi for us unlike table service he served us the sushi one piece at a time which allowed us to savor each piece yoshi provided us with a description of each fish we tasted answered our questions and provided us with an education that no menu could provide preconception sushi is never filling and always leads to late night pizza before the meal i even told my gf to prepare to eat something after not with bakos omakase we started with a silky green peaflavored tofu amuse then a miso soup and had our first piece of sushi fresh tasty and interesting pieces later a huge rice ball had formed and expanded in my stomach and i could barely walk outpreconception omakase at a sushi place means submitting to a merciless chef who doesnt care for what you like definitely not with chef yoshi before he gave us our first piece he asked us whether we had any favorites or if we had dislikes i had no preferences but my gf liked amberjack kampachi over the next pieces yoshi navigated us through a masterful progression of sushi that included two types of kampachi amazing otoro and chutoro uni seared salmon and a unique snappershiso leaf piece this omakase was the perfect balance of going out of our comfort zone but maintaining some control of our meal preconception sushi is not worth the price before i got the bill i was convinced that the waitress thought we had gotten the omakase is a lot of money but when you believe your meal is more expensive than what you paid for that is what you call a deal where else can you have fresh and eyeopening pieces of sushi served piece by piece to you by a kind and caring chef where can you be introduced to more than types of seafood artfully prepared where can you have a conversation with your chef about the food youre about to eat and learn more about sushi
wait what how can i not have reviewed this place yet dbq you have been in my heart for the last years and in my stomach for the last hours whenever i am done eating here i go into a food coma i sit silently wishing i had room to finish i never can this is the true reason i have gained weight since moving to nycrather than give you a legit review as if there arent enough here i am going to offer something very special to you invite me with you and i will tell you what to get its that simple i know the secrets not all the sauces are on the table and i plan to keep it that waythe only thing that bothers me about this dbq is their lack ofthe mac salad side that they have up in syracuse you hear me dinopeople get on that dinosaur barbeque to the uninitiated

finally a restaurantwinebar that understands that these establishments have become commoditized i know its a made up word and the differentiating factor is the service sit at the bar on most evenings and introduce yourself to jeff he is extremely knowledgeable and one of the few people in this city i accept recommendations from blindly especially considering his wine palate hes outgoing and friendly without being invasive go to aroma and tell jeff i sent you tell him your friends with little pizza

dammiti wish i never walked in here no this isnt a negative reviewbut i think i can now say who is responsible for any extra weight i may gain from going herei was coming back from a shopping excursion at a local grocery store when i thought to myself hey isnt baked around here i should get a couple sweets to share with my parents this is when i did a double take drove by and circled the block for a parking space i think i practically skipped to the bakery based on all the good reviewsi bought a vegan lime pistachio cookie a apricot rosemary bar and a chocolate cloud cookie i then returned to the car and figured well i should at least sample them right the vegan lime cookie was quite limey and fragrant tasting but not overpowering thick yet light and somewhat crisp the chocolate cloud cookie washeaven thick moist dense almost like dark chocolate fudgey pudding and chocolate chips combined in the dough i could definitely see going into a chocolate coma from eating this in its entirety in one sitting holy frak but my absolute favorite was the apricot rosemary bar butterflour crust with just a touch of rosemary and a layer of apricots in an almost jellypreserves form sprinkled with a crumbled oat topping i never would have thought of this combination but it works the buttery crust melts in your mouth and the apricot pairs extremely well with the rosemary unless youre not a rosemary fan then this isnt the bar for youthe remains of the cookies and bar are sitting in my fridge at the moment i had to keep getting up to taste them again to write this review im very tempted to consume the rest of them but ill wait a whilemaybeyea thanks baked shakes fist at the skyill be back hey thoughmaybe in the future if i walkrun there from home i wont feel so guilty about consuming all those potential calories also if you see my parentsi never went to baked and i never bought any cookiesapparently i have zero willpower and like to blame others for my fat assat this point it just declines from here recalling stories of fellow yelpers and their secret eating habits run amok in my mind
walking around red hook i get the strange preepiphanic feeling of a pynchon novel especially walking past the waste nought store where everything seems infused with cryptic meaning the neighborhoods nighttime character has something insidious and wastelandish but also playful and absurd like a video game of who framed roger rabbit complete with shadowy figures smoking in foggy alleysthat said sunnys is a magical oasis of maritime love everything about the place like most everything about red hook has a sightly askew boozy waterwarped feel that makes me love it all the more the hardwood floors slant down toward the bar the springs and stuffings inside the booths splay out in all directions the back room is junkfull of ropes and old crates of beer from the oncefunctional kitchen nautical artwork is everywhere you look some of it by sunny hisself even the bartender has a kindly merman charm maybe its the bourbon talking but its hard to leave sunnys without falling in love be it with the bar itself the neighborhood the amazing wednesday night band or the saturday bluegrass sessions i even love the soap in the bathroomif you cant stomach the trek out here then stay in park slope its offthegridness is part of the charming reward of the place it wouldnt be such an oasis if it were easy to access or open normal hours i am going to come right out and say that this is my favorite bar in all the land i cant imagine a more perfect evening than heading to sunnys before sundown with a handsome man sticking around for the western swing then riding through the rain on the back of a bicycle over to bait tackle for a beer and a pork sandwich from the ice house next door swoon

i work in an office full of women which means that everyone is always watching their weight in theory or in practice there is dieting being done there is no arguing that it is a fact i love these women theyre awesome i spend a large chunk of my conscious day with these women ive taken on the role of the nice old lady in the office and like to bring in treats but they wouldnt snack ive tried everything the smaller bitesized things they can eat discreetly did ok but i knew there was something out there that would crush their will power something so delicious they couldnt resist don vito corleone voice i was gonna give em a snack they couldnt refuse end impersonation the plain presliced they cut it for you and have these little slips of wax paper in between each slice so you can actually lift the slice out its perfect these people are geniuses large cake for cash only is perfection in a box this creamy kryptonite carries redemption in every sinful bite smiles all around the mood was lighter in the suite and people were more chatty no one seemed ashamed that every slice was gone if you get there after theyll be closed but dont fret the store across the street carries them and so does the garden gourmet a local supermarket
so my peruvian friend jose took two of my buddies and i here the other night jose is quite opinionated about peruvian food and the quality of ceviche apparently this is one of the few places in the city that both meets his standards and is very authentic we had to try it the four of us sat at one of the tables outside star for the outdoor seating it was a nice temperate new york summer evening at around pm is there anything better than enjoying great seafood and people watching in the village on a night like thatwe started with the cs of peruvian appetizers ceviche choros a la chalaca y causa the ceviche clasico de pescado was delicious nice big pieces of white fish and plenty of onions and corn swimming around in the lime juice ceviche has got to be the best summer appetizer of all time its so refreshing and plays very nicely with beer the choros a la chalaca are mussels marinated with lime juice and stuffed with finely chopped cilantro peppers onions tomatoes and corn they were quite good the choros appetizer also comes with mussels which is plenty to share with a group this was my first experience with causa causa is like a mashed potato cake mixed with lemon juice panca gives you three cakes one topped with shrimp one topped with crab and one topped with octopus they were all tasty but the acidity from the lemon in the potatoes mixed with the lime from the fish was a bit much for me maybe next time ill try the chicken causafor entrees we got the lomo soltado the jalea and the seco de cordero lomo soltado is of course stir fried steak tomatoes onions french fries and rice garnished with a pinch of finely chopped cilantro it was excellent the meat was tender and this dish was perfectly balanced the jalea is my favorite peruvian dish because it reminds me of the food i ate in richmond virginia in our parlance its a big ol fish fry wit calamari shrimp octopus and fish lord have mercy the seco de cordero is a lamb shank cooked low and slow in a cilantro stew it was served with potatoes sweet peas and yellow beans dear god the lamb was perfectly cooked and literally fell off of the bone i highly recommend this place

i find it amusing when people make such a big deal about there being only one vegetarian option on the menu um welcome to my life the majority of restaurants in the upper echelon of regard have only one vegetarian optionthey just dont make a public spectacle about it like david changs trendy ride on the pork wave by offering at least one substantiated vegetarian dish on their tiny menu momofuku becomes one of the very few nyc noodles houses that is vegetarian friendly personally i find it charming that the chef is selecting my dish for me i suffer from none of the maybe i picked the wrong dish for me guilt that comes along with not enjoying a meal at such a renown restaurant so rejoice vegetarians do not heed misdirected claims from idiotic selfproclaimed carnivores that this food bar does not welcome you whatever distaste the momofuku brand has for your lifestyle does not show in the ginger scallion noodles heavy flaccid noodles dressed in a classic oilvinegarshoyu emulsion spiked with the title ingredients generously fill the deep bowl unlike other reviewers here i didnt think the noodles were too saltyrichly salted yespairing perfectly with the quick pickled cucumbers soft bamboo and seared cauliflower i also shared the roasted rice cakes essentially don bokki pan seared tender nuggets of gluttonous rice flour glazed in a vivid sweet chili sauce made with dashi per the momofuku cookbook and adorned with scallions and pale sesame all the decadence of pork baos turned inside out so please have no fear and brings your non prim donna vegetarian friends here
when i was a kid i had fried chicken every day for lunch from the time i was in first grade through the end of sixth grade then when i was in high school little old lucy from jamaica came into our lives she worked around our house she scored me weed and she made the best pan fried chicken ever mon spicy crispy juicy and highly addictive in the years since ive traveled around the world sampling fried chicken in food stalls across se asia in the back alleys of mercados in latin america and all over this great land of ours my point is that i may not know much but i do know good fried chicken and charles pan fried chicken which recently reopened in harlem under a new name after a car smashed into its buffet about a year ago serves up superb fried chicken i made the trek to this poultry mecca on a recent december night for about you get a choice of two sides and as much chicken as you want along with a drink lemonade mmmm and dessert i grabbed a paper plate and plied it with two wings a thigh and a leg along with rice and pinto beans even though this wasnt a fresh batch the chicken was lightly crispy on the outside perfectly moist inside and not greasy at all then charles gabriel the man the legend walked in from the kitchen next door toting a giant metal tray packed with fried chicken galore after learning his trade in his native north carolina charles has been cranking out these birds in nyc for years now theres some fresh chicken right there he encouraged me in his southern drawl as i leaped to the display case and snatched a breast another wing leg and thigh ohmygodthisissuchgoodshitmmmm meanwhile mrs charles was telling the story about the crazy crash that occurred last winter and forced the place to shut down the car came right through the front window and landed right about here she said pointing to the back of the buffet table the driver was a who was driving her boyfriends fathers car craziest thing i ever sawi was nearly finished with my meal when king charles reappeared with yet another batch my lucky day stuffed but still determined i hopped back to the buffet and picked out my favorite breast fresh as a newborn baby moments like this its what life is all about red velvet cake was the cap on a most memorable meal yes in my opinion this is the best bird in town i said goodnight and stepped out to the street a gypsy cab drove by blasting elton johns goodbye yellowbrick road across as i headed home full from my feast

michelin madness continues with a visit to this star sushi house on the ues madness is the key word in that sentence because it encapsulates garis approach to sushi from a purists perspective indeed should you partake in an omakase menu here you will be offered one delicious piece of sushi after another and none of them will be like anything you have had in your life whether in terms of presentation choice of ingredients or taste eating here is a phenomenal experience but it really requires an open mind and an appreciation for the chefs instinctsthe omakase normally has selections but you must indicate when you want to stop as such i actually pressed on to selections in total my memory is a little foggy but this about how it went toro tuna with grated daikon the toro was absolutely delicious but it was definitely undercut by the strong taste of the daikon basically i regarded this debut as a warning shot that all is not right here crowd pleasers are not beyond tampering with so sit up and pay attention shrimp with ceviche this was very nicely done the shrimp was perfectly cooked maintaining its natural sweetness the ceviche proved a perfect complement adding nuanced flavors successful though perhaps predictably so black cod with miso sauce an obvious classic pairing but not one i witnessed in sushi why has no one thought of doing this before tuna with tofu cream very nice the tofu was very fresh and worked well in this pairing squid with uni sauce nice contrast in texture i surprisingly picked up hints of peanut butter in the uni sauce if that is not bold i dont know what is snapper with salad of greens and lotus root this is basically a reimagining of a first course salad plate through the eyes of a sushi chef this worked rather nicely but i did find the salad piled a bit high which made it difficult though still possible to eat in one bite toro tuna with bbq sauce brilliant stroke i was really taken with this selection who knew that toro could be more decadent than it already is the smokiness from the sauce infused its flavor well this was perhaps the star of the night yellowtail with minced jalapeno again very nice contrast in texture the jalapeno was especially fresh and provided a mild heat to the dish very good salmon with sauteed tomato physically the largest selection i was a bit uncertain about how to approach it it turns out that it is possible to eat this in one bite but it is a bit awkward also i am not particularly partial to sauteed tomatoes so i was very skeptical that this dish would be a success but surprised i was this worked quite well i love culinary surprises like that mystery selection involving i think tuna tartare as good as the last dish was i still wanted to end on a high note i challenged the chef to create one additional selection for me i remember it being quite good fantastic in fact but even as i look at the photo of what i had i can not remember the ingredients of the dish that is fine of course i will relish the mystery of that great selection there was one additional selection in the course of this omakase but i can not remember what it was over all the sushi here if served in the original way would have been of a very high caliber comparable to what can be found at places like kanoyama or jewel bako but the bold and innovative approach to recreate recognizable dishes in sushi form that challenges the customer to try unusual flavor pairings that forces the eater to contemplate new and interesting textures in a food that is thought to be well understood is what really makes this place remarkable it is certainly not for everyone but any sushi aficionado needs to try it at least once to challenge what they think they know about sushi i know i was surprised more than once in the course of my dinner and i think you will be tooaside from the food i can offer up a few practical observations that may be beneficial to the future customer try to reserve in advance the place is unusually small and always busy you can walk in without a reservation and get a seat at the bar but you will not likely be as lucky as we were when i say the place is small i mean really small waiting at the door i actually had to back up to let leaving customers properly exit as there was no room for two people to stand abreast along the very narrow entrance be prepared for a high price tag a simple meal for two with drinks will run you about
there i was trudging towards the scrubway walking down a rather lifeless part of avenue u yes in gravesend how did you know i passed by what looked like an ordinary bodega then something drew me back ah homemade cheese hmmm ok i wasnt in a big hurry i opened the door and wow wowie kazowie i was spellbound by the cheese entranced by the stromboli bewitched by the ravioli mesmerized by the entire sparkling clean cosy little shop i procured numerous goods i couldnt resist despite the insidious heat outside and the warning in the back of my mind that cooking in this godawful heat was not the most brilliant idea more cheese please it was wonderful it was amorethe ravioli also homemade sang figaro artichoke figaro roasted peppers and delicate ricottathe homemade marinara was robust with flavor i could savordefinitely worth a sweltering cucinaso how do they survive in a now more jewish than italian neighborhood well they do offer some kosher products still you can get mr wonderful there and he is a bit of a ham a sandwich of course dont be inferring inferrentials buon appetito
if i were playing word association and the next phrase up was rice pudding i would respond with words like bengay golden girls toothless people vomit elderly with that said rice to riches has converted me into an official undercover senior citizen stars for the place itself location store and every single sign or poster and stars for the actual product at hand but boy oh boy did you come close to stars because you are a tad too pricey youre the hooker who i know is overpriced yet i still pay because she is soooo hot grrrrrrrr the signs inside the store are sheer genius jokes about money dieting boyfriends viagra hardons yeah really i am not kidding you etc the booths are ultra modern and hip cozy for two absoeffinlutely but not really for more people or crowds now before you read on and think i must be i must explain that because the prices are kind of pricey for what is really rice i like to feel as though i am getting my moneys worth and to help me with that i sample several rice puddings every time i enter my favorites classics ones i want to give second shots to just for the sheer point of giving me more cinnamon sling tastes like a bowl of cinnamon this is for the hardcore cinnamon lovers raisins are in their too as a little bonus sex drugs n rocky road i liked this one a lot marshmallow chocolate a combo of everything mashed which is always a good thing coast coast cheesecake call yourself a cheesecake lover and have not got to this yet shame shame shameeeeee shame on you chocolate chip flirt clearly named after me mmm chocolate i kinda liked this one but i wouldnt order it if i were simon and this was a singer i would say america likes you but you are simply too karaoke darling hazelnut choc bear hug this is in my top favs but only because i love chocolate and i love the nocciola flavor itself fluent in french toast too much cinnamon involved in this or maple or something but not horrible strawberry floozy i wouldnt order it because i am not a strawberry lover but if you are by all means old fashioned romance so this is what you are supposed to taste like when you arent in your fancy costumes and flavors well i dont like it you remind me of smushed rice krispie treats and i am not that fond of them either at least i sucked it up and tried to like it i was spoiled with all of the great flavors category caramel too much of this not good a few spoonfuls and mmmmm ultra carmely don cappuccino someone in my family lovesss this one no names dont worry your secret is safe he probably doesnt even want others to find out about this flavor conserving it for him moving on corner of cookies n cream thought id be more into this since the ice cream flavor rocks but it was okay not orderworthy and the winner of my personal favorite goes to the milk chocolate only rings twice words cannot express how much you mean to me you undercover chocolate pudding pop there are a few flavors i wouldnt try because i dont want to be first to vomit in this particular store of all stores the prices of a single serving which could easily be for people that have selfcontrol is bucks prices went up due to recession yup people seek comfort food during this time and look who took advantage yet i still cant find it in me to give you stars four of the plain jane flavors come in a diva size that is bucks epic is what your best bet is it is and you are able to put flavors inside easily sharing if you wanted to do that also when going to someones house for a game of charades or what not what better than to bring a sumo or moby size that will feed a ton of people all sizes of rice pudding come in cool containers with matching spoons that can be kept forever and ever different colors when you bring your rice pudding home put it in the fridge it is sooooo much better very cold enjoy the staff they are so super friendly that you will find yourself trying to purposely annoy them sorta like those guards that dont smile supposedly maybe i should get some tomorrow for old time sake it has been days or so

sizes onlythe huge billboard was the first thing i read emerging from the subway station well i mused it was but to be expected that plus sizes would prevail in the neighborhood given the unprecedented number of bakeries per square mile in the little italy of bronxas i stood in front of morrone pastry waiting for my partnersincrime to arrive i reread the reviews for madonia best bread and cannolis danced off the iphone screen and i was so tempted that upon meeting champagne frank i immediately brought up madonia frank who also has a sweet tooth didnt need any convincing no harm in taking a lookno sooner had we walked in and surveyed all the breads jalapeno olive prosciutto etc on display that i noted from the corner of my eyes that frank had already ordered the chocolate drizzled cookie and was evaluating bread options wow what happened to just taking a look i thought as i placed my own order for a pound of italian butter cookies pignoli amaretti biscotti etc the serving lady politely packed everything and thanked us courteously as we left as we were leaving i mentioned to frank that in our excitement we had forgotten to sample their celebrated cannoliwe went back and the lady took out the shells and piped in the ricotta cheese fresh into them frank took a bite and gushed how great the ricotta cheese tasted much like frosting as i bit into the crunchy shell i too realized that the texture of the cheese was dense semifreddo like and while not too sugary sweet brought out a great balance of citrus and chocolate chips in the flavor exceptionalhowever while the shell was not soggy frankly it did not add anything to my enjoyment of the cannoli to its credit the crisp shell didnt flake all over as is the case with some other famous cannoli places that pipe in ricotta i am looking at you roccos madonia regularly wins accolades for the best cannoli in the city it quite possibly deserves the accolade as venieros cannoli are not piped in fresh even if their ricotta cheese similarly tastes fantastic i will reserve judgment here till ive gone back and sampled the cannoli at a couple of famous italian bakeries in brooklynfor my moneys worth madonia has some of the best italian cookies in town while not a big fan of their biscotti other than pistachio chocolate my love for their coco cashew cookie is fast approaching that for levains cookies the textural variations one bite crunchy and the next fudgy nuttiness and cocoa all come together wonderfully another delightfully rich cookie is marios special with chocolate chip walnut and coconut again due to the flavor and texture variations please note that these are nothing like levains cookies though bestinclass in their own rightbut before you commit yourself to a contractual relationship with madonia do remember that it will extract its pound of flesh in return or rather add at the very least a pound of flesh from your returns let the huge billboard serve as the surgeon generals warning for no portia will be able to bail you out
my top things ever family fantastic food and love i was completely immersed in the three from the moment i sat down for my birthday dinner at bozu ive been sitting on this review for about a month its hard to come up with the words to describe such a perfect experience our server was a complete joy i had chatted with him for a good five minutes on the phone discussing the tasting menu that my family would be enjoying he paid attention to every detail from my sisters nut allergy to the fact that my grandmother is not the biggest fan of all things spicy what a pity it was no surprise to me that his attention to the little things translated to our inrestaurant experience after ordering our divine mango margaritas sans alcohol for those who do not drink we were presented with our first course several bowls of very thinly sliced lotus root in some kind of soysesame sauce ive had lotus root before and thought it was decent but this was fantastic nutty savory and slightly crunchy a wonderful introduction to the culinary delights that bozu has to offer course tofu saladthis tofu was unlike any tofu ive had in my life this salad is presented as a sort of japanese spin on a caprese salad the tofu is almost reminiscent of cream cheese and complemented perfectly by the basil infused soy sauce dressing tomatoes and avocado its a creamy and fresh taste explosion divine course stuffed mushrooms these arent your great aunts famous stuffed mushrooms this is not what she serves at her dinner parties these are heaven in mushroom caps theres no way to describe how these are better than any stuffed mushrooms but they are trust me course rice croquettes fried carbs doesnt get any better than this sage and squash stuffed balls of rice fried to a golden crisp some people at the table werent ecstatic about this dish but i thought the flavors were on point perfect for fall and comforting course tuna tatakituna tuna tuna holy crap some of the best tuna ive ever tasted and we were here on a sunday the grape plum sorbet was an incredible accompaniment to the almost stained glasslooking tuna rare silky this course was a serious course sushi bombs spicy mcbomb shiro bombbliss pure bliss ecstasy rainbows hearts stars and puppies exploded all around me as the sushi bombs graced my tongue both pink white tuna were incredible i would change nothing about these other than to make them available to me whenever i please the shape the melt in your mouth heaven sent tuna the accoutrements kataifi ginger sauce spicy mayo the quality wasabithis is the kind of sushi that haunts your dreams course japanese fried chickenthe only miss of the evening this tasted like a bizarre japanese take on popcorn chicken i found myself biting into many a gristly piece through the strangely dense fried shell and found the flavor of the dressing to be strange and confusing it wasnt delicious i was surprised that our fabulous server said that it was one of the best items on the menu although i was disappointed by this course i in no way let it affect my opinion of the establishment course steak with asparagus and fingerling potatoes hell to the yes this steak was cooked to perfection served with sagey potatoes and fresh expertly cooked asparagus a dream and an interesting departure from the rest of the menu extra courseordered by unlucky herselfpork betty definitely a renamed version of the classic dish buta kakuni this pork belly was unreal cooked in sake sweet soy sauce with a dab of wasabi sauce on each piece this course was so rich it was nearly a chore to indulge after our intense meal still we carried on and clutched our stomachs at the thought ofdessertbozu graciously allowed my grandmother to bring in her famous martha stewart famous chocolate cake he placed the candles on the cake my family sang and we thought we were good to go we were mistaken the server rushed back to ask us if we would mind going through that rigamaroll again he explained that a japanese tv crew was filming a segment on the restaurant and wanted footage of the birthday ceremony we agreed and i put on my best tv face andsucked in the courses of gut after that amazing meal and realizing how wonderfully i do have it it was difficult for me to even make one wish forget two it would seem i have everything i could ever excluding beverages pork betty tax etc party of
review dedication brooklyns finest cm peter d after reading his review of luigis the pizzeria sparked many thoughts of wanting to try their pizza without the brooklyn cms indirect suggestion this review would not have happenedtheres a tall tale legend that the mozzarella used at luigis is about years old word has it back in the days of immigrant voyages to and from native italy a time when luggage was not inspected the grandfather of the legendary owner of luigis would bring back mozzarella from the mainland in mass quantities the mozzarella that was brought back is apparently used in the pizza todayof course i will not speculate as to whether this legend is true for starters i hope it isnt can anyone imagine consuming one week old mozzarella let alone something thats a century old didnt think soa venture to luigis was not to confirm this legend nor was it to dine at an establishment where the movie big daddy was filmed so what was the reason for going to luigis my mechanic is a block away from the pizzeria and yours truly was in need of lunch yep thats it alright so peter d had a little indirect push with this one arent recommendations from friends the ones most noteworthyarriving at luigis revealed a surprising site no line this came as a shock as most patrons that have dined here before me warned of the to minute wait nevertheless the petite surprise was welcoming good pizza that required no waitwalking into luigis provided a slight feeling of claustrophobia yet excitement for starters the front counter area is small luckily the petite nature of the ordering counter allows for patrons to view the creation of each individual pizza by the owner giovanni on this particular occasion two renditions were available for purchase plain slice fresh mozzarella slice i began to order one of eachseating in the back of the establishment was small and quaint the section is available for approximately people segmented into tables of and tables of most patrons order slices made by giovanni and eat standing in front of the establishment a la artichoke pizzeria in manhattan nevertheless the pizzeria was empty and a table immediately behind the gas oven was availableplain slice perfectly balanced in both texture and flavor to start the crust possessed a beautiful contrast between crunchiness and a soft doughy texture there was no smokiness or excessive char stemming from the crust what you do get is something thats remarkably flakey but possessing an abundance of crispiness the tomato sauce was full of flavor in both the structure and balance a heavy robust detection of salt pepper and oregano were evident with each sampling the processed mozzarella topping was the definitive statement for this slice with its slight gooeyness and saltiness the flavors of the mozzarella helped to further amplify the already hearty tomato sauce furthermore the processed mozzarella had a subdued level of oil renderings that was by no means burdensome the slight excess in oil provided the welcoming balance in flavor to bring all elements of the composition together simply put one of the best plain slices one can consumefresh mozzarella slice similar in application to the plain slice the difference stems mainly from the fresh mozzarella topping and a slight drizzle of herb pesto contrary to the robust and hearty nature of the plain slice the fresh mozzarella used in this application allowed for a slight contrast in flavors stemming from the robust structure of the tomato sauce with that of the subtle sweetness of the fresh mozzarella the contrasting flavors worked to create a welcomed disparity in flavors that made the slice more pungent in nature ultimately the fresh mozzarella slice is finished only by the drizzle of herb pesto the components of the pesto itself are speculative but hints of basil salt and garlic were evident during taste detection the pesto provided a much welcoming complex flavor stemming from the velvety buttery texture of the extra virgin olive oil while supplying a powerful earthiness in the basil used for the pesto ultimately the fresh mozzarella slice is robust complex and full of flavorleaving the restaurant after consumption revealed a line of about people perhaps we arrived at the right time nevertheless giovannis renderings are often worth the wait more frequent than notnotes cash only worth of pizza doesnt need to be debited charged wait times anywhere from to minutes best combination plain fresh mozzarella slice most patrons visiting giovannis domain are locals you wont find many out of towners tourists here

holy m theres flavor in my coffee i wasnt expecting that at that moment when i realized how low my expectations for good coffee were i became abashed until now my standards for coffee ranged from watery burnt dish detergent to strong and smooth little did i know how many layers there are to appreciating each unique blend of coffee i generally go for a small drip coffee as my baseline comparison i was wordlessly handed an empty cup by the lessthanperky staff and eventually found my way over to the coffee machines at the front of the tiny shop there were two light roast options and i chose to go with the ethiopia amaro gayo organic aroma tamarind raspberrylime cherry taste mellow acids sweet berry character body longlasting syrup composed finish semisweet cocoa honey sunrisei could notice almost everything in that description i felt my appreciation for artisan coffee rise as i could now attribute more to a good cup of coffee than doesnt taste like dirt all the info can be found on their website in case youre too much in coffee nirvana to jot down mental notes i know i certainly was

it was all red and black and smoky that night like a film dated by the sun or wine but i dont know i dont remember i drank too much scotch and i leaned into the counter drummed my fingers on the bar and looked at the barkeep with two heavily shadowed brown eyes and i believe i ordered a scotch and soda with a twist and at one point in the evening discussed that said scotch and soda with a twist is the drink a scotch drinker has when its warm out and i must have wrapped my sweater tighter around my shoulders because it wasnt warm at all and we talked about the rise and fall of the american novel about metafiction about the uselessness of an mfa and even the relative uselessness of a phd to which we all laughed and laughed and some of us drank and drank some of us felt forlorn some of us felt saved i felt drunk and lost my balance someone picked me up and my scotch and soda with a twist and walked me out of hotel delmano while someone else paid my tab that was the first time the phd and i met but not the last time we would drink scotch on a sad bar stool on a sad evening

we consider it an added bonus that we live down the block from this place free wifi organic food and live jazz all contribute to why it holds a warm place in my heart the lobster mac n cheese is my new close to home favorite food honestly i probably would eat it every night if my boyfriend was as enthusiastic about it as i am its made with cheeses and fresh maine lobster that tastes so buttery and delicious i wish there were a few extra pieces thrown in the prosciutto panino is good enough to be served at bagatelle or some other high end restaurant id bet money that you havent had one with ciabatta toasted as crunchy and crisp like they make it at indian road cafe the service is great they will honor your order no matter how close to closing it is and the calendar is always chock full of cool music and comedy performances plus its close to home i think jason minter did inwood a huge favor by adding this delightful cafe to the neighborhood

aburiya has the privilege to be one of my few with just one visit and honestly i don think im doing wrong since i was blown away from food to service to ambiance the modest entrance doesnt reflects at all what you will find once you get inside i think i was the only caucasian there maybe someone else hiding in the second dinning room that i couldnt check very well they have semiprivate rooms for small groups ppl and two common dinning rooms with tables for people the one in the back includes the bar kitchen where the guys are preparing the food that will bring you to heaven deco wise just japanese classic elegant and simple the service was excellent polite friendly and very helpful our waiter keep asking us how was everything made recommendations and i think he had some special attention because i was clearly the strange element in that scenario so he wanted to teach and please us more id resume aburiya as traditional authentic and the kind that id expect at japan that hopefully ill discover some day they have an endless sake and shochu offer japanese beers white and red wines regular cocktails and champagne and not alcoholic drinks as well we order oolong tea cocktail which is shochu with oolong tea served cold and in glasses full of ice it was very refreshing my friend knows japanese much better than me so he order everything also because the menu will take your words away i was a little lost they are specialized in izakaya japanese tapas style of food apparently aburiya change the menu depending of the season and the availability of the ingredients this dinner was weeks ago and so id suggest that you ask your waiter the specials or new items in the menu even i was lost there was two things flashing in the menu to my eyes homemade tofu in bamboo basket and kimchi grilled octopus ok ok this is more korean but come on you already know me how i could resist and no my cheeks are not red now the tofu was amazing smooth creamy delicate in flavor aburiya tofu stole the first position in my rank to the one that i got at en japanese brasserie it comes with three different types of salt including wasabi powder that i loved the octopus was amazing as well perfectly grilled and spicy as i like we also order crab croquettes it was good fried of course but not oily a thin coat and creamy stuff im not a fan of croquettes but it was one of my grandma specialities so i know when its good the salmon was amazing they serve the piece with kama collar very fresh and the inside was semicooked and lightly sauced to keep the real flavor but monkfish liver and the sashimi were the ones that makes me more happy i never had monkfish liver before and its gonna be a regular in my orders lets see how is it in another places the one at aburiya was great i think it was served with ponzu for sashimi we got toro and uni the pieces were huge superfresh and full of flavorahhh thats why i like japanese foodhaving menchankotei for ramennoodle soup geisha for sushi omen for innovation ise for consistentreal japanese food im glad to add aburiya to my list of japanese destinationsrecommendations in the city without any doubt
life would be so much easier if i were smartcase in point if i were smart i wouldnt have procrastinated and come here sooner yes it is a hike from downtown or brooklyn and yes its worth it the only disappointment in my meal was the cornbread not so much bad as bland and boring everything else i ordered or tried was very good to excellent i like that the sides are not afterthoughts as they are in many bbq places the creole potato salad was great it had a very nice tang to it sort of a cross between a deviled egg and potato salad the mac cheese was a little soupier than im accustomed to but still tasted good i love the dry rub ribs tender juicy without much fat i liked them dry but a variety of sauces are available if you like your ribs wet the spicy sausage was well a spicy sausage not as hot as a texas hot link but very good while i doubt this would be destination for vegetarians if there are any in your party there is a smoked portobello sandwich plus a variety of sides to choose fromdinosaur bbq also has a fully stocked bar even though on my visit i stuck with sweet tea no im serious i really did and it was goodmany reviews complained about the wait for a table so it should be noted they now take reservations directly or through open tableif i were smart i wouldve ordered more food not because my meal wasnt enough i was stuffed and didnt eat again that day but because this is a place you want to take a doggie bag from i spent sunday watching sports wishing i had brought some ribs or chicken home from dinosaurif you like bbq dont be like me or the tin man head to dinosaur bbq now

ive held off on writing this review until the von snarks had their babies hoping that it would go under their radar as i ventured onto staten island their turf and did not tell them my friend rob and i had been talking about going to enoteca maria for months and on a whim he called and suggested i head in later that day to try it outrob explains that they put the nights menu on the webpage around noon we check it and no menu twelvethirty no menu one rob calls and tells them the menu isnt up the guy on the phone says come in youll like it i loved that theres nothing more appealing than cockiness as long as you can back it upwe really did like it we liked everything stuffed artichoke sangria ziti with peas tripe ok i did not like that but its because i dont like tripe not that i dont like their tripe the flavor was fine but the texture always does me in and about other menu items the tapassized plates are conducive to those who like to try a lot and the meal was incredibly reasonable for all that we ate i think it came to about each including tip and a pitcher of sangria if you can believe it i think this place is actually worth a trip into staten island even if you dont have other things to do there though i keep hearing there are things to do there
the film forum is probably my favorite arthouse in the city primarily for their stellar and carefully curated selection of films both old and new i dont claim to be a film expert nor am i a film snob but i do appreciate what the film forum has to offeri was so excited when they did a charlie chaplin retrospective last year for awhile i had a steady stream of his films on my netflix queue but watching them on dvd at home just doesnt have quite the same effect theres just something really cool about seeing a classic film on the big screen and the indie films ive seen here have been really interesting as wellthe theaters are very small and the chairs are definitely not the most comfortable especially if youre in for a doubleheader but somehow its perfect for this moviegoing experience i really love coming here in the middle of a weekday because the theaters are virtually empty and i feel like im having the film screened just for me the film forum is one of those places i go when i want to have some quality solitude i almost always walk out of the film forum feeling refreshed inspired and just a little bit more cultured and for that i give it a solid stars
reasons why i like hunter hes cute he makes me feel beautiful he makes me smile hes full of compliments for me too bad hunter is my stylist and not my boyfriend though if he were my boyfriend and not my hair dresser then i wouldnt be able to say the following things about him he always listens to what i want he always gives me what i want he never disappoints meoh snap but seriously if you have typically notstraightbutnotcurly wavy asian hair see hunter he lived and worked in vancouver for years where most of his clinetele were asians my hair always looks great after he cuts it even months afterwards i usually feel uncomfortable walking into super trendy cool and expensive places but everyone who works here from the owner nick arrojo himself he smiled and winked at me twice to each of the receptionists turned out to be sweet and smiley if i could afford to pay plus tax and tip more often for a haircut id return more frequently for now ill continue to return every months much to the chagrin of hunter and my many split ends

let me preface this by saying appetizerstapasstartershors doeuvrescanap√©santipastos are all my favorite part of a meal so much in fact that i have been known to order only appetizers as my mealwhich is why i love loco tuesdays so much please note loco tuesdays does not apparently mean that you have to bring your own loco it means that youre loco if youre not here on a tuesday i mean why wouldnt you be priced tapas holla for a dolla the sangria is delightful not too sweet and at only for a pitcher its my kind of delectable bargain be sure to order appetizers per person and order the guacasalsa for the table whilst you wait their chips are great plaintain chips malanga and tortilla chips i recommend the ribs and the calamari and the crabcakes and everything really except the lobster quesadilla which i didnt care for since i couldnt taste any lobster the service varies here once i was here and the waitress was bothered by us and apparently everyone of her other tables but maybe she was on the rag i dont know the last time i was here the service was good i like the people that come here they draw a diverse crowd which i love i think this is one of my favorite places

ooh yeah baby ooh motherfreaking yeah it dont get better mang seriously this is what im talking about i am tempted to end the review here but i will explain my unintelligible rantive come here twice and had their sloppy bao spice curry beef green mango basil and the second time around i had the spicy cat fish because they ran out of the sloppy bao both were deliciously satiating and i really could not have asked for more at a reasonably priced per sub i got a baguette filled with meat spices bean sprouts and other vietnamese ingredients that i ignored to place with my taste buds because i was too busy being a fatass devouring every bit i actually brought my lsat classmate during our lunch break and he simply died went to nirvana and came back to finish the lsat classas a side note their sandwiches pair great with a side of pommes frites right around the block on ave bw st marks pl and st and the dipping sauces are great for lacing your sandwiches for an extra kick a nice summer ale would be good to wash it all down as well i am drooling now thanks
this place rocks my socks off you sign up for a timeslot for either indoor or outdoor you cant change it they harness you up so beware if you have any type of belly piercing you have to take it out because it will rip that piercing out kind of scary i do wonder what happens if you have an outie belly button but looking at that is more disgusting than a ripped belly button ring they give you a few easy instructions on the ground thenits a long wobbly climb to the platform of probably stories high it doesnt look scary until you climb up that ladder so powder those hands up because you will be sweating with fearonce on the platform a little bitty guy grabs onto the back of your harness while your other hands are clasped tightly around the bars for safekeeping he brings over the swing bar which is heavy they told me it was pounds but it felt more like for your right hand to grab while the left is still grasping firmly to the metal bar next to you thenhe tells you to lean forward with your feet still firmly planted onto the platform you have to be at like a degree angle sweat pours down your brows and your underarms are soaked with perspiration gross but true thenhe tells you to let go of your other hand and grab the swing bar with both hands now um hellll no but he tries to reassure you that hes got you you tell him you weigh probably the same amount as my left thigh i am not letting go he tells you trust me i got you just grab the bar with your other hand finally with knees shaking teeth chattering you do it thenonnnneeetwwwooooothree jump wooooo hooooooo look ma im flyingflip easy release easy the catch nailed it i am so ready for the circus now ringling bros aint got nuthin on me
terroir was full up when we arrived so a gander at yelp for iphone led us to desnuda and we were glad it didid like to describe the delectable ceviches we ate in greater detail but i dont remember all the ingredients suffice to say they were all delicious one i remember was yellowfin tuna marinated in grapefruit juice with rice noodles sesame seeds cilantro and slices of grapefruit another was salmon with mango and a sauce that made us lick the bowl it came in the wine list was indeed reasonable and we tried a chardonnaygewurztraminer blend from uruguay no less that was tasty even if my companion found it a bit heavy on the oak and a blush cava that was quite refreshing with the ceviche the palm fans waving back and forth were dreamy and took me right back to my recent excursion to the long bar at raffles in singapore which has rafts of them waving back and forth as well and i believe is where they originatedthe staff was helpful and welcoming the space is tight but cozy and the music is good we talked to the chef quite a bit who was doing most of his preparation right in front of us behind the bar he apparently was the chef at bond street at one time and said he finds this to be a much more relaxing and fun place to work it shows in the ceviches he produces yum go here its wellcrafted clean food and a nice departure from the regimented feel of your run of the mill sushi bar
the almond croissant may be the best ive ever had seriously and im an almond croissant aficionadowe also picked up two bags of their financiers because time out new york just wrote a blurb about them citing them as the best most perfect financiers in the city these are bite size little pastries sort of a cross between a pound cake and a macaroon in consistency meaning theyre dense but far better than either we got a bag of the lemon and a bag of the half chocolate and all i can say is wow wow i liked the chocolatevanilla ones better just because i believe that chocolate really does make everything better according to the time out article they make the financiers in other flavors like pistachio and special for valentines day raspberrychocolate i must have bothi will be gaining lbs thanks to colson this month and it will all be worth it

with a name like the slight detour you just knew this drink was gonna be good i ordered it the other night at mayahuel my new favorite watering hole in nyc the name promised an attitude adjustment if only a slight bit and thankfully the drink a trio of jalapeno tequila reposado tequila and joven mezcal mixed artfully with agave nectar and xocolati mole bitters delivered the goods the smoke of the mezcal combined with the sweetness of the agave and the spiciness of the tequila and soothed my senses soon my hectic week seemed to have order my stress became a thing of the past ahhhh this was tonic for the soul indeed mayahuel a relatively new spot in the east village pays tribute to tequila and mezcal with drinks like the slynx cabeza pequeno and stone raft the place also serves mexicaninspired appetizers and main courses but other than chips and salsaguac i was there to only to drink admittedly with its wood walls and funky decor mayahuel reminds me of a cantina where i got trashed a few years ago la casa de mezcal in oaxaca a province in southern mexico thats home to the worlds best mezcal there are main seating areas at mayahuel in the alcove near the front door at the small bar where there are also cool banquettes and upstairs where there are about tables id shoot for the bar though you cant go wrong anywhere along with the slight detour i recommend a drink called tequila gumption which is mezcal y reposado with maraschino orange y angostura bitters it was sort of like a mexican version of the caipirinha from brasil i also highly recommend sampling some of mayahuels mezcals straight up in particular check out any of the del magueys such as san luis del rio chichicapa see my photos for shots of mezcaleros in the remote town of chichicapa oaxaca or crema de mezcal these are some of the finest mezcals in the world and not often found in nyc lastly dont leave without guzzling down at least one michelada if youve never tried one this is a combo of spicy sangrita and cerveza it comes in a pint glass with a halffilled bottle of negro modelo granted this drink resides in its natural habitat on the beach in a place like zihuatenejo but still on a hot august night the mayahuel michelada comes close to perfection mayahuel me encanta

i was meeting my friends at the flea at so i tried not to eat much that morning to leave room for all the goodness i knew was coming but my ill just have a few baby carrots turned into how the freak did i just eat a whole bag of carrots so i arrived less then hungry but i waited weeks to get my pizza moto and i was going to eat that pizza whether i wanted to or notin most edible situations i believe cheese is the most important element but not so with pizza with pizza im all about the sauce so as i forced that first bite into my unwilling mouth i was nearly overcome by the zip of the tangy and sweet tomato sauce that looked so sparse on the puffy crust the punch of the sauce is matched by the chewy pillowing sourdoughy crust and although my pizza did not get a dusting of parm since it was the last pizza of the day it just means next weeks pizza will be even better
because i have no intention to grow a mustache i pop into madhus once every three weeks each time i get exactly three things done my left eyebrow my right eyebrow and the fuzz ive got going above my top lipi very much prefer threading because my sensitive skin tends to react negatively with wax note that ive had terrible hair removal instances in the past including leaving with one eyebrow less during the peso all you can wax special while i was in argentina however at madhus i always leave sansgoatee with perfectly arched eyebrowscant beat the cheap prices either i spend exactly each visit for brows for the upper lip tip to the blessed soul that defurs me most importantly visit nine times and get the service free aint no way mamas gonna look like a sasquatch no that doesnt mean im george of the jungle yeah that sounded like a good idea at the time
only two dates and ive fallen in loveno not with a person silly with huckleberry bar i enjoyed huckleberry on so many levels first i just want to point out that i like the name ok moving alongthe mixed drinks and wine selection are fantastic im generally not a fan of mixed drinks see my review of little branch which is the only other place ill consume them but these are works of art in a glass special mention a fellow yelper had an article which included citrusinfused luksusowa vodka and fresh ginger juice he let me try it and dayummmmthe food isnt an afterthought but carefully crafted the menu is small and the plates are small but it offers something for everyone i loved the goat cheese ricotta crostini with espelette pepper the marinated olives a goodsized bowl of em for only were deliciousthe staff were lovely when i first entered i thought the server was a friendofafriend who i had yet to meet as she was chatting so comfortably and sweetly with the guests in my group more props to her and the rest of the staff because of the following story it seems a young mother cat had recently decided to call the back garden home she promptly gave birth to a litter of beautiful kittens and set up camp i met the kitties when they were weeks old and by then the huckleberrians had found adoptive homes for them and had plans to bring the mom in to be spayed way to gook well go back inside now where theres a long bar separate little high tables and a loungey area great amount of space full but not supercrowded both times i was there i felt very athome here both inside and outside there is an utter lack of pretension bravo i hope huckleberry keeps it up at stars

j and i have a pretty extensive home bar with over bottles of liquor and different varieties of bitters its nice to have options you know we have a vintage handcrank ice crusher mounted to the wall and special molds for making giant spherical ice cubes ice spheres that fit perfectly in an old fashioned glass while were more than competent when it comes to mixing and even creating classic cocktails like the manhattan the martinez and the mint julep there are admittedly some glaring gaps in our repertoire like eggs how on earth do egg drinks come out so foamyto remedy this i bought us spots in astor centers class pdt presents intermediate home bartending for js birthday i feel that the best kind of birthday present to give is one that you also give to yourself no hosted by two barkeeps from the infamous hot dogphone booth speakeasy the class promised to bring our skills to the next level with lessons on making our own infusions swizzling playing with fire and working with the ever elusive eggwhen i walked into the classroom my jaw just dropped jessica f does a great job of describing the space in detail so i wont but let it just be said that this has got to be the most wellthought out and perfectly designed hightech functional space ive ever been in ill add that theres a light box built into each station which i assume is for wine classes for our class we each had a complete bar setboston shaker strainer spoon muddler and jigger the class itself was excellent they started off on the right foot by immediately making a large batch of punch which we sipped while they demonstrated how to make our own ginger beer next up we got to try our hand at julepsi made a variation on the classic using maple syrup and apple brandyyum we were then treated to a spectacular pyrotechnics demonstrationa flaming hot toddy which was poured back and forth between two silver mugs creating a long stream of blue flame it probably goes without saying that we did not get to try this ourselves finally it was egg time the assistants came around and placed an egg in front of each of us and i was instantly reminded of high school health class when we had to carry an egg around all day to learn what it would be like to be a teenage parent except this egg was meant to be broken first our teachers made what is one of the most complicated cocktails possible the ramos gin fizz and we watched in awe as they created a stiff tower of foam that extended several inches above the rim of the glass we made the slightly simpler pisco sour and new york flip both of which were creamy and delicious here is the key to egg add all ingredients to the shaker before adding ice shake the shit out of it this is called a dry add a ton of ice and then shake vigorously for as long as you can physically bear it literallythroughout the class we were given lots of interesting historical facts and useful tips perhaps the most entertaining of which was this letter written in the regarding the mint julep wont regret reading the entire thing i promiseby the end of class we felt full of knowledge and also full of booze however we had plans to meet up with two of our favorite cocktail connoisseurs for more drinks i leaned over to j and whispered were in trouble

steak gluttony excessive eating must be dinner at peter lugersexpect nothing of a high end style dinner at peter lugers the restaurant embodies the principles of an old school steak house that prides more like egotistically prides itself on its steak and other notable offerings for those whom are accustomed to world class service extraordinary d√©cor and lush flavors youre in for a true disappointmentwe arrived at lugers for an reservation my group consisted of individuals after the host telling us itll be a slight wait we proceeded to the bar for a few rolls along and our table is readythe service waiters have been known to be obnoxious at times our waiter had similar properties but because he knew we were locals regulars didnt bother giving us a hard time when first arriving at our table we were greeted with the words what do you want our party of simply glared at him and told him exactly everything we wanted including dessert pitchers of water and constant beer refills he simply smirked and proceeded to place our ordersthe foodshrimp cocktail a basic application of a shrimp cocktail served with a side of cocktail sauce there was nothing memorable about this application other than the simplistic but welcoming contrast between the sweetness of the shrimp and the mild acidity from the cocktail sauce one thing worth mentioning is the size of the shrimp theyre simply enormous the to pound measurement was comparable to that of or the shrimp were huge not to mention succulentbacon slightly salty but welcoming the abundance of fat and size of the bacon made the application similar to that of christmas ham with each bite the mild brashness of salt is then eased by the abundance of fat thats balanced by the semicoarse texture from the lean parts of the bacon patrons will find that the sheer size of the bacon to be enough to entice any palate our party opted to order a second serving of bacon for everyone on the tablesteak for two the porterhouse provides for an even distribution of the marbling within the tbone steak that allows for a balanced taste between protein and fat the delicate and bold taste of this steak is generated through its aging process steaks are hand selected and are then aged for a period of approximately days to allow for the marbling deposits to flavor the meat upon preparation steaks are cut according to party size and are then cooked in a degree boiler seconds for med rare for a steak for two this gives the steak the nice charred shell on the outside while providing tenebrous juices within each cut the entire process is conducted with no seasoning thus giving the steak its genuine taste at first consumption patrons will find that the natural meaty flavor of the steak is allowed to shine in the application the mediumrare cooking temperature of the steak is similar to that of a rare cooking temperature at any other restaurant when consuming lugers offerings patrons will find that the slightly salty and charred exterior works remarkable well to balance out the meatiness and undercooked internal parts of the meat needless to say the steak for two is not to be consumed for the faint at heart steak lovers will find that lugers rendition provides a natural steak flavor thats comparable by few other restaurants out there lugers ability to embody the natural taste of steak is one that is right to deserve its highly acclaimed praisecreamed spinach gluttonous heavy and in many ways excessive the creamed spinach was just as expected consuming the creamed spinach is similar to eating a stick of butter you simply need to prepare for it from a consumption standpoint the spinach was creamy and has remnants of the mild coarse texture of the spinach the texture and flavor of the creamed spinach is engulfed by the excessive amounts of butter extra virgin olive oil and garlic used in the preparationgerman potatoes picture home fries with more oil thats lugers version of german potatoes the well seasoned and crispy potatoes provide further gluttony to the meal nothing beats meat and potatoes for dinner and lugers rendition of the german potatoes is one where extra servings are requestedcheesecake with schlag the cheesecake was good the schlag was better best advise is to get the homemade schlag by itself the natural frothy and creaminess of lugers rendition of whipped cream is one to be consumed in its natural form both fluffy and mild sweet the schlag itself provides a welcoming ending to an already excessive dinnerneedless to say salad and grilled chicken awaits patrons for days on end after dinner lugers the excessive amount of food consumed during this single sitting is one that should not be overlooked come hungry leave overly stuffed

i fell easily deeply happily in love today i fell in love with a little familyrun pastry shop on a much overlooked section of street shadowed by the petite abeille next door ive spied the pastry counter in passing but never went in what a fool i was i fell in love with the display of abundant freshmade daily pastries each one just misshapen enough to be telling of a human hands careful love i fell in love with the the way the shopkeeper behind the counter greeted me immediately as i entered and wished me a happy birthday while turning a blind eye to my offer of payment i fell in love with the mindnumbingly closeyoureyesandgotoahappyplace perfect banana chocolate chip muffin that i let the storeowner pick out for me they lie resting one by one still in the muffin tin each one sprouting a luscious muffin top covered by chewy caramel balls in a light crumble coating the incredibly moist creamy distinct banana filling is speckled with rich chocolate chip chunks at the bottom all other muffins should be jealous of this harmonious balance of flavors and textures each building upon another in layers that blend together to create a sensation your taste buds will thank you for absolute perfectionmost of all i fell in love with the comforting thought that there are still places that arent always out to compete for repeat business but offer up such genuinely exceptional service and products that they will secure a permanent place in your heart so much that not coming back is not an option so thats how i fell in love today
okay so im not a stalker but ive sorta been stalking this place the first time id walked by i was drunk and i was completely surprised to find something like this it seemed like an antique store and even in my inibriated state i knew id come back the cincher was the oscar wilde quote scrolled onto the full glass window looking into lillies forward a couple of weeks i could not go back bc i wasnt quite sure where id seen the place and a coworker who used to live down the block asked me if i knew anything about this place i knew exactly what place she was talking about but again could not figure out where it was she told me it was on this block and for the last few weeks ive come by about once a week to peek into their window and check up on their progressand then tonight despite having checked earlier this week and still seeing the opening soon sign up i decided to walk by on my way home from the gym imagine my surprise when i saw people smoking outside and as i approached saw the place completely packed now its not quite as charming completely crowded and im not going to give everything away but here are some highlights an antique wood carved bar that undulates the length of the room and antique chairsfurnishings shipped all the way from belfast its somewhere in between being in a chateau and one of those historic european bar i almost wish theyd do the we only allow as many people in as there are seats policy adopted by pdtbourgeois pigs and the likes so those in can fully appreciate the beauty that has been brought together by the ownersso if youve never ever taken anything away from any of my reviews listen to this run dont walk to this new bar

i totally love beet the first time i came here was with a bunch of friends and wed been drinking all day i fell in love with my pad thai with vegetarian duckand i thought well maybe i was just really drunk and it wasnt that good but i came back sober ordered the exact same dish and loved it just as much whats so great about it to me is that theres a lot of sauce so many other pad thais are a bit dry this is plenty saucy and that goes for the fake duck as well very moist and tastythey have house wine by the glass for only score i like the bathroom here its a unisex with signs on the door that say women and men the women sign has a flower on it and the men sign has a banana on it and the sink is really unique theres a copper pipe with holes in it where the water flows out of and seems like it would be a really soothing setup for a shower the drawback to this pretty cool design is that if you turn the faucet on a little too much the water splashes everywhere and you end up looking like you had a little accident in the bathroomi will be back beet one of these days i need to try something other than the pad thai
peter and i sit in a booth at the second avenue deli picking at the halfsour pickles cole slaw and gribenes on the table we order matzoball soup and corned beef sandwiches with fries and prepare for an onslaught its our day off but conversation eventually turns back to the magazine to the industry to colleagues i make peter try the kasha sinking on the bottom of my chicken consum√© i show him the best way to dip challah in the soup to get it good and soggy hes never had deli with a real jew before he admits and i dole out the basics of kosher no dairy with meat no shellfish no pork lots of rich heavy bland food no matterit is delicious we dip the lean corned beef on rye in a tiny dab of spicy mustard and finish off the meal with a sip of chocolate soda thats breakfast lunch and dinner peter laughs afterwardi agree but im not kidding its and im done for the day
this is one classy jointwith cocktails that could knock out a hippopotamus helpful tattooed bartenders in vests and shirtsleeves beautiful vintage wallpaper moody lighting thoughtfully designed and sparkling clean bathrooms and a cool slightly older crowd im going to go ahead and say that the richardson is my favorite bar in brooklyn the prices scare my somewhatemployedformerartstudentself but you get serious bang for your buck and anywayevery time ive come here ive been taken care of i think the warm interior has something to do with this rash of generosity as our bartender also brought over two free drinks for the big spenders in our group if you go and you must get your inner don draper or joan holloway on wear something snappy order a glass of aged whiskey or an oldfashioned and itll be a night to remember
three things you didnt know but now you know one year my dad bought my sister a mockelectric guitar called the jaminator my best friend and i rocked out on the jaminator and stuck my little sister with two sticks to make a drum with thus we created our band in my basement all three of us we called our band toe breath and we had a one hit wonder based off a local commercial jingle i have two sweet dance moves that ive coined throughout my wild days at the clubs theyre called the grandpa hat and spare any change ask me to show you it would be my honor madonia brothers has the best bread and cannolis in all of arthur avenue you need to go to arthur avenue for some bread and cannolis you get your ass to madonia you get yourself any goddamn piece of bread in the whole store and then you go to duane reade and get yourself a camera you shove that camera to one of your friends hands and tell them to get ready you then ring the doorbell of wherever youre bringing your fresh italian bread of the gods to they open the door see you brought them madonia and yell things like youre a legend youre a champion youre a saint you make me not want to ever sob deeply about anything ever again and you make life worth living and after that awkward last chant they carry you above their heads like the winner you are and chant your name in proud victory like in the movie rudy your friend takes a picture three things you didnt know but now you now

this review will achieve levels of nerddom that will easily surpass that of my met and frick museum reviews against the azure blue sky of a brilliant early summer afternoon i could see the majestic roof line of the cloisters signaling to me that my long journey north to the nether reaches of manhattan was nearing its end as i drew closer i could hear the rousing sermon of pope urban ii as he rallies the assembled christian princes to crusade at the council of clermont but the voice faded with every step closerfrom its high perch alongside the river i imagine the cloisters a lonely sentinel guarding the passageway south into manhattan protecting us like fortress abbeys of old from viking marauders or attila the hun the scourge of god the sound of the bus returns my mind to the presententering through a heavy wooden door i expect to be greeted by abbot berno the first abbot of the mighty monastery at cluny or perhaps by saint remigius baptizer of clovis first king of the franks and father of the merovingian line of frankish rulers but neither the benedictine monk nor the saint appear only the museum cashier as i walk around the first colonnaded cloister i wonder how the abbeys defenses will stand up to the imminent attack of the moorish leader al mansur and his bedouin army that has been plundering the surrounding countryside and laying to waste its inhabitants will we be safe here my train of thought is broken by jayne asking me where the restroom is i return to descend down a staircase into a chamber of crypts and i catch a glimpse of alcuin of york penning his work propositions of alcuin a teacher of emperor charlemagne for sharpening youths i have so many questions to ask of him my eye catches a glint of summer sun in the stained glass window and when i turn back hes gone perhaps my presence was too much a distractioni enter a room of tapestry and can clearly see gerbert daurillac the future pope sylvester ii speaking in hushed tones to hugh capet perhaps they are discussing their plans to depose lothair and install hugh himself as king of france and effectively end the reign of the carolingian line of kings i half expect to see otto iii join them my pointwhen rockefeller imagined the cloisters it was with the hope that visitors would be transported back to the europe of the middle ages that we here in the present day would be able if only for a brief time to walk amongst the ghosts of antiquity to this end the cloisters is a rousing successnerd in the hizzouse
filipinaamerican new yorker yes thats who i am take away any of those cultural elements and your picture of me will be incomplete no i wasnt born in new york but like millions of others i arrived a young immigrant and i forged my identity growing up on the streets of new york yes i remember the crimeridden days when times square was an unsafe place to be at night yes ive been mugged a total of three times all before the age of and yes i was allowed to roam the streets during outlunch at the ripe age of not only that but i was taken to broadway shows the ballet and the opera as a child i learned how to take the subway and bus by myself as i commuted to middle school on the upper west side i had a short stint as a prep school kid and was happy to escape i went to one of the top public high schools in the country and made the closest friends i have to this day ive met the most amazing creative inspiring generous gracious and wonderful people from all walks of life throughout my time here i honestly cant imagine living anywhere else in the world right nowi sometimes think about how different my life would have been if i had grown up in the philippines or even louisville ky where we lived for a brief two years before relocating permanently to nyc what kind of person would i be would i still be a writer a curious traveler an avid food enthusiast im not so sure but something drew my mom to this city and despite her yearolds tantrums she picked us up and moved us up north and im eternally grateful for thatyes this city shaped me inspired me and contributed to who i am today it still does there is simply no denying it and i wouldnt have it any other way
not every flavor is a complete winner but there are enough winners to keep me coming back again and again ill start with the skippables for an ice cream shop with distinctly asian flavors on offer the red bean here is very disappointing its sweet with a vague hint of red bean but rather bland the corn is interesting but not particularly good the itty bitty corn bits are a nice touch but i would actually prefer a stronger corn flavor the pumpkin is tasty but is missing a little something some spice would really help it along the hazelnut is almost excellent but it may suffer from too much cream and not enough nutand now for the winners i always get a scoop of wasabi when they have it the wasabi ice cream is bravely made with the distinct heated flavor of wasabi shining through the cream its no mere modified vanilla the black sesame is divine rich and mellow but not overly sweet the mango tastes fresh and pure with the fruit and cream playing off each other for the perfect note of fruity sweetness honeydew sorbet will take you back to childhood summers with fresh melon bars butter pecan coats your mouth with the decadence of good butter and the clean refreshing mint chocolate chip may be the best mint chocolate chip ive ever had the ice cream is consistently good across the board beautifully textured thick smooth and creamyas you can see ive eaten more than my weight in ice cream at this place the parlor is clean and charming all white with the ice creams displayed in colorful rows and cakes looking pretty to the left the service isnt noteworthy in either direction theres no grumbling over repeated requests for samples but i havent gotten many smiles either the servers also dont seem to get the concept of flavors in scoops or flavors in scoops etc this is why i always have to get three scoops it is also why one time after finishing off my three scoops i went back to order two more the ice cream is just so good and i can never choose just one or twoor sometimes three or four flavors
tasty tofu is what i think about when remembering my experience at kyotofu i came here with three fellow yelpers gia andre and natasha after the ny wine expo gia and andre would not stop raving about the place and how great it was and they were sure right as soon as we walked in buzzing off the ny expo wine i felt relaxed when i saw the white walls contemporary wall layouts and ambient lighting we were seated by a friendly attentive young woman who informed us of complimentary mimosas and bellinis on sundays during brunch hours and a half off special on bottles of sakewhile the faint underground electronic music was bumping we agreed to share our orders so we ordered the smoked salmon donburi french toast with a kahlua dipping sauce the quiche chicken tofu burger and the famous mac and cheese they were all amazing we were more than satisfied the bottles of sake had us feeling great and nothing could have topped it better than sweet tooth gia ordering the signature omakase dessert which consists of different dessert courseswho knew so many great tasting things could be made out of tofu im definitely a fan
andre and i like to spoil ourselves sometimesand for us that usually means indulging in some fancy footwear for our evenings out unfortunately treating ourselves this way comes along with a very hefty bill we all have those cheaper shoes that wed practically kick rocks with but when you start paying it hurts deep in your soul if they get the slightest scratches or scuffs plus in this economy we cant go around throwing away perfectly good shoes thats why we bring our shoes to leather spa some btch spilled wine on your new giuseppes broke a heel doing the lambada in your louboutins scuffed your ferragamos fighting some fool in tenjune no worries for a price leather spa will bring those babies right back to their glory days they managed to clean and polish a rather nasty black smudge out of my boyfriends blackwhite pradas and shine up another pair for about on the spot for bucks they shined and repaired the heel to my worn down tribute pumpsso i can keep delivering the hottness when i walk down the concrete runway

reviewthere are days in our life that seem like any other day but they are borne of events that end up making them extraordinary on saturday i spent the entire day in brooklyn and was exposed to every great thing about that borough i never appreciated all that i was missing until that day but one thing clearly stood out grimaldis pizza i am almost embarrassed to say it i mean if i see a line of tourists i immediately look for another place to go i am not even all that crazy about pizza i usually dont even eat the crust everything about this place just seems wrong for me as a couple we would never make it my friends would whisper in my ear telling me that this grimaldi girl is bad news but i have to throw away everything i think i know about food or at least pizza because this is the best damn pizza i ever had in my life how do i know i ate the entire pizza by myselfyes you read that correctly i am a fairly thin guy who is never yielded to gluttony and somehow miraculously i summoned a ravenous appetite that could not be assuaged on my pizza i had the pepperoni and the garlic sweet spicy delicious pepperoni rustically cut thick and robust in flavor i slavered for this but then there was the garlic i do not recall ever seeing garlic as an option for a pizza but it was a brilliant stroke warm roasted fresh garlic made this pizza sing thats amore the marriage of such hedonistic tastes was further enhanced by the gentle call of that decadent marinara like a siren leading me not into ruin but into unabated temptation i was more than pleased everything was just right about this pizza even the crust the crust so light and puffy as i was just savoring this experience they played new york new york in the restaurant indeed i was just having one of those incredible new york daysnow i am in a terrible predicament i have found the best pizza in the world but it will only see me in brooklyn and even then only after i wait an hour in line like glimpsing david for the first time you are awestruck but you can never have it to yourself you must suffer for the great things in life so only in an effort to make the lines a little bit smaller stay away from this place the pizza is terrible here leave me alone to eat all of it by myself

so this is the advantage of living in queens oh ok got itthe combination of being engulfed by a few story buildings on the periphery a few spot lights gives you the feeling that you are stepping onto citifield for an atbat during a night game as such i ran through the bench aisles doling out high fives and then when i got to the end i jumped chest bumped a random stranger it was the atmosphere i swearthen there is the fire pit its only about ten feet by feet but it did prompt roommate i to hop around on one foot and do a rain dance fortunately our dancing sucked and did not please the rain gods studio square also has a wonderful slate style patio not the gravel pit of some other local outdoor venues did i mention the area is freaking huge this place knows theyre going to get jammed in the summer and have planned ahead at least two large bars where we didnt wait at all for drinks open mf saturday sunday about individual bathrooms for the fellas sorry but youre not supposed to go together for breaks anywaybetween studio square water taxi beach perhaps dutch kills lic looks like its becoming a nice summertime addition to anyones repertoire
this is the best malaysian ive had aside from eating in malaysia itself the atmosphere isnt anything exotic its your average lowkey asian restaurant stuffed onto the streets of chinatown little italy the wait could be long so the other option is to go to jaya which is also good and has a cool atmosphere except they dont serve my favorite dish which i will mention belowi like to do family style at any asian restaurant i go to because there are so many different flavors to each dish its good to share like everyone else you have to order the roti canai which is a thin papery crispy pancake that you dip into a curry chicken sauce you should also order the roti telur which is a thicker pancake stuffed with egg and onions that you can dip into the curry chicken sauce as well i also like the steamed spring roll with the jicama and shrimp its very similar to a vietnamese fresh summer rollbest dish that no one seems to write about sarang burong it is a mix of shrimp chicken snow peas and other veggies sauteed and put inside of a fried taro basket this dish is out of this world the fried taro basket can take the place of coconut rice because of its subtle sweet flavoring to offset the saltiness in the dish itself i mean i dream about this dish it is that good i havent been able to find another malaysian place that makes this except place in malaysia i dont know if it is authentic persay but i all i know is that it is damn goodthe tumeric rice dish as a side is good too it is coconut rice with shrimp eggs and chinese sausage the hainese chicken dish is also very very good you will spend about each on a good filling authentic dinner

things here used to be a little more affordable when id seek spiritual solace after leaving hermes depressed over a pair of sneakers or a sweatshirt and how id never be the proud owner of either id come here and enjoy a glass of champagne and an sandwich but now that kicks at capital h costs upward of and a hoodie runs around i guess the now glass of bubbly and the sammy provides about the same amount of comfort caused by incomprehensible inflation during a relentless recession the location and space are beautiful the service is incredibly friendly and relaxed and of course the desserts border on mindblowing
one of my good friends was visiting ny for the first time so i took her for a little candlelit dinner on mulberry street im extraromantical like that boys could learn from me though a few guys have it down those at buona notte for instance we strolled along little italys main stretch hearing the blurbology of each menu some delivered with such charm that would make any girl blush points for little italy because charming old men are just adorable little old ones who offer you free sangria those are my favorite forgetting the menu at the mere mention of free sangria we skipped inside immediately we were presented with a basket of fresh bread and two gargantuan glasses of pure sweet bliss we shared an appetizer and entree meanwhile hoping that the restaurant wouldnt be all grrrr about us skimping on food as we happily sipped our sangria however just the opposite happened the waiters were just smitten with us and let us stretch our meal over the course of a couple hours we ordered a second glass of sangria did i mention that this is liquid ecstasy cause it is and had the perfect catchingup date little did we know good looking waiters are actually practicing to one day become charming little old men the service was excellent every appearance was made with a dash of good conversation charisma and a little thing i like to call italianhottness our waiter brought dessert on the house and by dessert i mean kahlua all of our drinks were eliminating the need to move on to a bar so we continued camping out and enjoying ours perfect evening in italy when we thought we had better move on the waiter asked us to stay if we were content and casually refilled our kahlua glasses i love that my little hour long dinner plans melted into a good three hours at least every second of it was perfection making this one of my most memorable dining experiences in new york cute old men stop trying to entice me to dine at your restaurant tonight i know where my spot is

i love levain i shot up in an instant the president of our company looked up at me in wonder did you suggest that to usermnobut i wish i had i added still smiling in excitement i then sat down and the meeting continued my coworker in marketing explained that it had actually been their idea to gift our advertisers with treats from levain as he spoke the president looked up levains site and flashed an image of one of the bakerys humongous cookies on the conference screens leaving it there for the rest of the meetingthis was last thursday when the secret of levain got out to my company of course ive tried to spread it numerous times before ive known about levain for almost a year now ever since ive found myself dejected countless times at the blank stares after my mention of levain oh youve never heard of it thats ok you should really try it sometime those are my calm automated responses which flow out instantly to cover up my real reactions of how do you not know this yet who deprived you my child whhyyyy yi cannot be pretentious though it wasnt my own discovery to begin with when you date a dessert connoisseur you find out many things you did not know before so i cant take credit for it but i do give credit where its due and i can only say this levain serves up the best cookies i have ever tasted take it from any originality ive never seen a bigger cookie than this monster of about an inch of thickness texture its warmth and moistness allow the flavors to meld together into one harmonious splash of sweetness taste from chocolate chip walnut to dark chocolate peanut butter chip levain cookies will satisfy a craving no matter which flavor you pick and finally simplicity levain doesnt boast any outlandish combinations nor does it offer any unique ingeredients thats the magic of the tiny unpretentious basement bakery with only four cookies on the menu made with the most common ingredients levain constantly wins publicity from renowned food blogs to yearly food lists sure each cookie may contribute about calories to your tummy and hips but who ever said that one wont keep you full for about two meals worth of your day if you havent visited levain yet go it deconstructs everything you ever thought you knew about a cookie and alters even the most dignified composure even as i napped later that day after my first trip to levain i woke up to find the cookies we had taken home gone though he frowned and shrugged in seeming cluelessness dessert connoisseur still had crumbs on his fingers to this day when i think of levain i smile i smell not only chocolate and peanut butter but a good dose of culprit as well
candied baconsorry i know its not a very creative review but im not sure what else to say except candied bacon i could yammer on about great service and the ability to get a last minute reservation on new years day when the place was standing room only or the great bloody marys or the croaker or poached eggs but i firmly believe the only way to sum up the smith is with a resounding candied bacon
fantastici had the great pleasure of dining here last weekend with a near and dear friend who happens to be a yelper too and it was a very special meal i think megan c said it best when she said be prepared for an enchanting eveningthe wine was a red from languedoc was supremely good the service was great they even accommodated my request to order a dish from the prix fixe menu as an a la carte dish the rouget with iranian saffron risotto then came the halibut which was almost overwhelming rich but ohso tender and perfectly cooked my famous foodie friend you astute yelpers will be able to guess who had the eggplant terrine im definitely getting this if i ever go back and a chefs specialty vegetarian entree not as impressive their famous breads were also good they have more than a handful of choices so you can keep going back for more the saffronwalnut bread was particularly delicious as others have noteddeserts were chocolatey and delicious a chocolate soaked brioche for me see pictures and chocolate souffle for the fff an interesting combination as they were similar in appearance but subtly different in texture and flavor oh and the restaurant itself is beautiful the red room casts a beautiful dim light over everything its the perfect backdrop to an excellent meal the apples and the lemon saffron loaf on the way out were just the icing on the beautiful bouley cake i saw couples young and old friends and families all sharing the delicious food here and enjoying themselves tremendously i had been wanting to eat here for over a year and i was finally able to do so with fff by my side and across the table d stars for the food service setting and of course the company

there are certain things that once you spend years getting it for free its real hard to pay for later in life for me those things are haircuts and movie tickets in my younger years i pimped my hair out for an hour to aveda at hair shows around southern california but then i moved away to college and never got another hair cut again three years ago i finished my masters degree and finally had to get a real job i bought a white button down shirt still never been worn a suit ok just the jacket a tiffany necklace on my moms credit card and a overpriced pina zangaro portfolio and quickly landed a position proud of my adult accomplishments i decided it was time stop my haircuting fast and asked my friend with the best looking hair where i could get me some she directed me to commune with the words i close my eyes as she cuts my hair and pray that when they open i will look half japanese this alluring description began my year patronage of stylist nobu who with little instruction gave me brilliantly choppy layered locks and tiny seasonal bangs but then nobu moved back to japan and i was at a lost months later with a head of horrid split ends i called commune to save me againmy instructions were simple cut off as much as you want make it super choppy and please get as much body into my bone straight fine hair as possible my new random stylist mika had a wider language barrier then nobu so i kept making funny finger gestures like i was waxing an evil mustache on my head to explain the flyaway tips that look so awesome on me but as the inch strands began falling from my head i just sat back and let mika do her thing and oh lordy she gave me the best hair cut ive ever hadthe prices have gone up to which i would have a really hard time paying if the woman who does the washphenomenal head and neck massage with your choice of aromatherapy oils sweet and bright lemongrass for me didnt have magically strong nimble wizard fingers that steal away you worries and washes them away down a warm fragrant drain even if you have to wait to been seen the front of the salon is minimally filled with lovely jewelry but hands off i want it all

this store is always christmas all year long you walk in and lost instantly in lalaland because you know that you are in a chocolate store but it is all written in polish so your knowledge on whats what is the same as years olds brain and taste buds i am not into themed boxes of chocolates this place is where you can grab a chocolate bargain by the pound packed with endless coffee bean bags of truffles many many i would say at least bags you grab some of these and some of that but there are still more to pick the deal of please control yourself mix my definite favorite is coconut truffle it has coconut picture in bluesilver wrapping if you have enough of liquorish ones you will get drunk so parental discretion is advised i get several pounds for christmas gifts for my neighbors around the block kids or someone you would like to give something or some occasional treats good for halloweens too most of all these truffles are already individually wrapped in shinny and pretty wrappers potentially assumed for christmas and holiday spirits so only thing you need to do is eat some and give

if theres anything that will make me sell my firstborn slap my mama or sell my cats into slavery its humboldt fog cheese i say bah to the goats who produced this delicious slice of heaven and to find it in a classy little bar miles away from the humboldt county yes that one that produced it is a dream come true hey i aim low but that makes me easy to please sample is a cozy little bar serving the usual libations but with a respectable nibbles menu of olives cheese cured meats and sauteed vegetables food i could basically live on the space is very well laid out tables spaced well apart for conducive conversation great music at the right tempo because grandma here is hard of hearing a small outdoor patio and shelves lined with curious antique collectibles i wont say chatchkis because that would imply more camp than classgracious accommodating bartenders who even gave us baguettes to take home

this place was supposed to open in november that didnt happen why i hate when people equate things they dont like to nazis but its largely because of nazis bureaucratic powerobsessed new york city governmental naziseven though the pennypoor new york city government could have reaped countless thousands in taxes from this operation since november they opted to forgo the fundage and make life miserable for the proprietors for months they finally got their license or licence as the english and irish call it now all is well with the worldlillies is a fantastic gorgeous irishvictorian establishment i would be there every night if i could but i cant because i made babies and my wife would grimace much come home shed say and shes the boss of meregardless its a wonderful venue with countless quality beers on tap no miller lite if i remember correctly and thats a really good thingnice menu what we ordered we enjoyed what we drank made us wind up doing karaoke down the streetmy only complaint the tvs tvs are to meatheads what fire is to moths but the crowd didnt bother me i was simply happy to have a wonderful pub in the immediate vicinity of my domicileone day i will sleep here
i got a promotion so i treated myself to one of the most perfect places in the world back all the drinks are half off i got there at and you best believe i had every single beer they offered on tap by they were all delicious particularly the sweet action the beer from the cask was a little warm it was all good though went down smooth like mothers milk magically i bumped into a former colleague dressed head to toe in formal wear macho macho naturally i suggested we crack some crabs only dollars each we had to sit at a special communal table covered with the days nytimes handy he smashed crab all over himself better take off your rolex champ and i laughed and laughed while gingerly pulling sweet flesh out from my expertly hand opened shells thats what ties are for they were invented so that your coat wouldnt dirty your shirt unfortunately now theyre more expensive than shirts his voice trailed off as he looked at his crab juiced italian silk heeheehee we played a drinking game since we only had an hour for halfpriced beer for each crab we ate we had to chug one beer my idea old bay seasoning is a good rim for carbonated wheat a great thing to take the edge off something too hoppy id say the crabs were smothered in it so sensational the gm and servers watched our game slightly amused mostly they were impressed we knew how to eat crab after washing our hands thoroughly we sat down for dinner my colleague almost got whiplash when he saw the burger with all the fixings come out of the kitchen and he ordered one immediately it was so beautiful id eaten it many times in the past pure fresh beef joy and declined a bite it looked juicy in fact so juicy it dripped all over his expensive navy sleeves tisk tisk hahaha why am i evil i ordered the most delicious thing ive ever eaten it was a roasted vegetable dish on top of wheat each little root vegetable was too precious their skin was so sweet from being lovingly roasted the little cippolinis melted away like french caramels mmmmm dirt candy we ordered two desserts the stout float and the doughnuts hahaha for every doughnut we ate we had to chug one glass of beer my idea again the doughnuts were perfect cakelike and yet refreshing with its lemon verbanay glaze such a smart satisfying dessert the stout float i wasnt liking so much good vanilla ice cream though the strawberries were a little too syrupy what am i talking about i was just too full to put it in my mouth it was bitter tangy creamy dreamy my lightweight colleague hailed a cab pussy but i walked happily back home with my food baby in tow ftw back forty is the best at what they do which is bringin the delicious
undeniably i tend to admire certain types of beauty more than others fine features coupled with the right sensibility makes my skin tingle so what about special kind of nomenclatures that mix the best of both worlds in order to produce a rapturous shudder in my hypothalamus i want to speak about one such lady she was a hapa half korean half american to be exact a mixture that i will never forget and that i will keep revisiting time and time again the korean aesthetics were there that attention to clean detail and modern lines interspersed with the american necessity of hodgepodge a wall cobbled together with various new york pictures contrasted the greenwhite lounging area towards the back small cushioned stools low and minimal the korean sensitivity prevailing in the overall d√©cor on the wall painted black cages meant for one thing only to trap aesthetic junkies like me into an endless repetition of this dangerous interracial spawn hotdog korean fooddroolsi devoured my delicious hot dog showered with dakgalbi bbq with no consideration whatsoever to matters of weight this was not junk food as far as i was concerned the moment when the american classic mixed with the korean classic a new taste was born meant to make you forget about the street quality of the meal by adding a touch of home and flavor to an erstwhile depressing and vulgar option my bulgogi hot dog was even tastier and as i eat this hapa with ravenous intent i couldnt help but remember the words of jane who had told me at the counter kimchi and veggie hot dogs are coming soon be sure to come back you heari will jane i so will
hands down the best tart frozen yogurt of the bunch forget red mango they dont even serve oreos as a topping option forget pinkberry they have a horrible aftertaste and you know im right about that flurt is where its at i was supposed to go out with the girls this past saturday night i got dressed up for the occasion my sister if shes reading this knows this means i traded my college tshirt and winter uggs for cute high heels and a dress i may have even curled my hairthe problem i practically fell asleep in said clothes before making it out so i decided to change into my sweats a ponytail eye cream and my glasses or as i call it sexy and call it a night just as i was about to curl up into my bed my roommates tempted me with the only thing that could get me out of that fantastic and delirious state of mind frozen handles please lets go lets take a cab i beggedwe are flurt girls they responded almost in unisoni was a little hesitant because handles is my favorite place in the world currently i even talk about it at bars when theres a conversation lull thats how much i love handles but im in this happy and great place right now in life where im open to trying almost anything new and since flurt is extremely close to the new apartment flurt it was so we walk in and its super minimal nothing on the walls at all only one flavor original and they take debit cards the girls explain the process to me you order a medium and you get three toppings simple we decide to go half healthy and half junk food strawberries oreos and chocolate chipscan i just tell you how generous they are with their toppings you know how when youre eating ice cream or frozen yogurt and you get to the middlebottom and there are no more toppings left all the fun was at the top and now you feel a little sad because its gone toppings in every bite at flurt they pile on the toppings and the best part was actually the fruit i think its because this froyo does in fact taste a bit more yogurty than ice creamy and therefore it goes better with fruit next time i might even forgo the junk and stick to the fruit i think they even have wheatgrass shots here but i really dont understand that i dont really believe in the benefits of wheatgrass im a wheatgrass skepticbut flurt frozen yogurt has made me a believer and totally made my saturday night bonding over healthy dessert this is going to be my dinner with fruit during the summer i can already telldont judge but i wont do that
ive never had ramen not out of a package before so when people started telling me about this place i couldnt quite fathom why people would pay so much for rameni associate the food with college kid budgets and sodium induced highs however after last nights visit my life is changedthey probably shouldnt call it ramen because it doesnt really deserve the negative connotation the wait can be brutal but thats understandablethe ambiance is beautifulthere is a small bar as soon as you walk in with a wall full of unique ramen bowls must be a bitch to dust and keep cleanthe hostess is adorable to keep her waitees straight she draws little pictures of what each person is wearing my friend and i were known as green coat and black coat fullon trenchpeacoat pictures in effectthe restaurant is a lot larger than i thought there are beautiful private booths probably would be great for big dinner parties and long wooden tables made for familystyle eating there are stark white walls with pop out japanese characters and an open kitchen so you can witness all their noodlemaking chaosdont expect a terribly expansive menu theyre really known for their broth ramensthere are five different kinds classic modern a spicy classic miso and soy i was told the modern was the most savory so i decided to go for that i opted to add in a flavored hardboiled egg it was everything i expected it to be the broth was so incredibly flavorful it was a blend of creamy pork flavors infused with a wonderful garlic aroma dont worry the garlic is subtle so you can still kiss your heart out later on ha the noodles are al dente and fresh they are a little reminiscent of somen noodles but without the mushiness there are three pieces of tender pork meat cooked so well that the fat was nothing but an explosion of juiciness that dissolves automatically on the tongue and i despite fat might be worth it to spring for an extra side order of itthe broth in all its deliciousness was ultimately too salty for me to finish but is really worth every single slurpi definitely woke up this morning with an intense craving that is foreign to my carbconscious self

kiehls ultra facial moisturizer with spf is the only lotion that will ever touch my skin the abyssine eye cream is the only eye cream ive ever used i started buying their creme de corps body lotion when i was sixteen after reading that a famous model was a fan and havent looked back to the drugstore since i also bought my poppa a gift set from here last christmas and dude was psyched oh and fyi the musk eau de toilette is one of the best unisex scents on the market by which i mean ill probably attack you if youre wearing it even if you a ladythis particular location is wonderful their gift wrapping is gorgeous and free the window displays are thoughtful a lost art really there are drawers full of free samples at the checkout and i love how the salespeople wear spotless white lab coatsuntil old age and big money kick inthen its cr√®me de la mer all the way except when im really low on money kiehls is expensive but a little goes a long way especially when it comes to their facial productsmy dad also wanted tickets to the rufus wainwright concert for his birthday gayyyyokay theres no probably about it its really that good
i dont even know how to describe the love i have for this placei didnt know which one i should taste so i ordered a savory crepe of sauteed chicken and mushrooms w swiss cheese and pesto when i took a bite i didnt know that it would taste that good the chicken wasnt chewy and the mushrooms were fresh but i think what really did it was the swiss cheese the swiss cheese really worked well with the chicken and especially with the fresh mushrooms although i really didnt taste any pesto which she probably forgotbut it was still delicioussweet or savory either one is good luckily my boyfriend had a sweet tooth so he ordered a sweet crepe the famous crepe the famous crepe consisted of fresh strawberries bananas nutella inside and topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream good lord was it good what really put it over the top was the fresh strawberries it was really really fresh like they have strawberries growing in the back of their store or somethingive read a lot of reviews about crepes and some people complain about the crepes being too thick but creperie crepes were just perfect it was not thick at all so it doesnt overwhelm the stuff inside but it also wasnt too thin that you couldnt taste the crepe at all it was also cooked a nice golden brownive never had crepes before and creperie opened up a world of sweet magic and wonder to my taste buds

highline park section one opens tuesday june section one covers the area from gansevoort to street near ave park hours are to access will be limited during peak hourstoday june was the press preview day and i got to see a sneak peak sans big crowds the website photos of the new highline park do not do it justice the or so blocks of completed park combine traces of the historic ironwork railings and sections of vintage railroad tracks with sleek modern design including neonlit underpasses beneath hulking concrete buildings and horizontal buttresses that seem to dissolve into gravel my favorite section of the park has cleverly designed wooden lounge chairs some are permanent fixtures big enough for a large group of friends to sprawl out others are individual chairs set on wheels that roll along one of the preserved sections of railroad track highline visitors can pull themselves away to some privacy or roll up next to another chaise for more intimate conversation very smarttheres a sleekly designed ampitheatre with a picture window overlooking an intersection in the meatpacking district even better the descending levels are interspersed with a ramp so its wheelchair friendlyone blocklong section on the west side is a functioning fountain of sorts with running water cascading over the concrete benches line the east side of that section so park visitors can take their shoes off and get their feet wet of course this is cute on opening day but i suspect the visitor to tempt fate is going to catch something that makes them smell like the old fulton fish pier in august it may also explain the nodogs rulethe highline is a park unique to nyc and unique from other parks we have here ive never seen anything quite like it if you lean on a railing overlooking the street below dont be surprised if someone yells to you hey how do we get up there and if that happens point em south to gansevoort street for now thats the only entranceexits are available at streets elevator wheelchair access at street section two of highline park will run from to streets and is slated to open in the section of track from to streets is owned by csx train corporation and they havent decided yet to allow park planners to continue the growth of the highline for the full length of track but dont be too hard on em they did donate the other blocks of elevated property to the city of new york for this project

i cant find enough good words to review this place so im going to let you do it mad libs style ready okayholy expletive this place is expletiveadjective seriously if you dont verb here youre a noun with negative connotation firstly the buffalo steak is adjective and really im not just saying that i cant think of many plural noun that are that adjective it was enough to make me want to verb right there on the table the same can be said about the adjective lamb and the bridge cafe salad though normally i verb blue cheese the staff is adverbadjective adjective adjective and adjective in fact some of them are so adjective that there are times where you want to stand right up and verb them but i digress and while some might say the prices are adjective those folks can verb a noun the portions are adjective enough to choke a collective noun of plural noun even the desserts and cappuccinos are adverbadjective in short you should verb here today but you dont have to take my word for it

if youve never tried taiwanese food is a great place to expand your culinary repertoire food is tasty service is fast if a little brusque and the price is not bad most rice dishes wont run you more than and nothing hits the spot like a comfort food dish like porkchop over ricewe came for dinner recently and ate familystyle and i really recommend the minced pork over handmade white noodles which is a spicy meat sauce over thick chewy noodles watercress and minced pork is a classic dish that you are guaranteed to see on most tables and the double cooked pork belly is a savory meltinyourmouth restaurant favorite moo shu pork was also a real treat and completely different from what youd expect at your local chinese takeout imagine shredded pork lettuce mushrooms and other veggie delights mixed in a flavorful sauce wrapped in a thin nearly seethrough pancake and dipped in a sweet plum and peanut sauce yum everything at is really flavorful with just the right amount of spice and sweetness to really make mouths water part of the allure of taiwanese cuisine is that they use a wide variety of spices and herbs both fresh and fermented leading to food that is simultaneously simple and complex i do caution that the cuisine is notorious for a lot of pork and intestinal foods but i think the dishes we ordered were pretty safe and caters to a cantonese palate there are plenty of dishes for every dietpreference still i encourage you to be more adventurous and to eat family style so that you can taste a wide variety of foods even though this place is regularly packed turnover is quick so your group wont wait long to get a table

once upon a time in a land called the united states of america snail mail was delivered by the pony express australia tried the same thing but with cows the cattle were much much slower than any speedy steed the americans had so they were constantly suffering from overexposure to the sun they originally tried to follow the us trend and call their system the mail moovers but after becoming the laughingstock of society they were dubbed the sunburnt cowsnow you know the story behind this little lower east side hot spot and can flash your historical knowledge when you go there to enjoy one of manhattans best brunches all you can drink mimosas and bloody ms plus a few other choices like greyhounds or screwdrivers combined with good weather on the patio and the charming aussie lads who have been planted as bartenders aka eyecandy my only complaint is that i dont get to go here more oftenthis is a highly inaccurate excerpt from moikipediai want one
its almost unfair to rate pizza shops in new york city since everyone knows the best one everyones got a favorite slice and in general theres always some subliminal bias tied to it say which borough its in or how esoteric it islucali is an amazing pizza shop ive been to many in brooklyn from the greasy slice place in every neighborhood to the high mighty and gourmet emporia of more recent days this is closer to the latter where a pie costs twice what it should and the wait is thrice as long as any normal person should stand around to eat what used to be peasant food ok that was a bitchy way to start sorry back to lucalitheir pizza is really good its all fresh mozzarellatype with rustic almost gourmet breadquality crust maybe the water in brooklyn really does make the difference the pies are huge and theyve remained very very basic with the technique applied to the crust and to the ingredients you can have put on your pizza there is no foie gras to be had and they left the truffle oil in their shopping cart at elis where it belongs seriously what is with the gratuitous use of truffle oil on everything at some places in this city the toppings available are essentially the type youll find at many typical new york city pizza places basic occasionally necessary and all very enjoyable you know pepperoni peppers mushrooms etc the pies are all made to order and theres a certain oldfashioned and clearly authentic element to them that i appreciate the menu is otherwise limited with some small appetizer andor calzonerelated offerings the calzone was very good by the way although the pizza is what its all about the shop itself is essential old brooklyn to me i think it was a former luncheonettegeneral storetype thing because of the remnants of old lighting signs shelves and the old awning outside that all point toward that very very dimly lit with exposed brick and cramped beyond belief it does not belie its location in carroll gardens which i always think of as a relatively oldschool neighborhood anyway this is however by no means a neighborhood hangout i am told that pizza enthusiasts come from farandwide to dine here and the crowd is certainly diverse the wait staff is an assortment of adorable locals with a good deal of enthusiasm theyre extremely friendly and accommodating even with diners who ask too many questions andor cant make up their mind and i think that in itself adds a certain quality element to the place lucali is also byob which is a nice touch theyll uncork your bottle and provide you glasses so you can bring your own montepulciano or franzia to please the only problem i have with this place is the fact that they have limited hours and dont take reservations of course neither of those is limited to lucali itself but indulge me while i regale you with tales of the time we were moreorless told that theyre too good for reservations i am confounded bad enough that they have a very limited amount of seats but when we cheekily inquired with the ownerpizzaiolo a k a the guy flipping the dough about this policy the answer became clear owning a popular restaurant in south brooklyn it used to be called that my father tells me that serves food that follows fad allows restauranteurs and chefs to give selfimportance a new meaning and while serving pizza like i said formercurrent peasant food youve come a long way baby highly recommended
the short review the best sushi i have ever had in my life prepared for me by a sushi legend chef yasuda himself easily stars if yelp would let me have the honorthe longer reviewi went here with jeff cs meetup group this was my first outing with them and there was no jeff c but there was chef yasuda in front of me at the sushi bar all night wow we were pretty indecisive about what to order we inquired about an omakase but they really dont do that but he was willing to choose selections for us in the context of our sushi matsu pieces of sushi and a half roll for and then we would be free to make individual orders after thatinstead of serving everything at once each piece of sushi is individually prepared and served this is more intimate and really builds up the experience with a crescendo of anticipation and increasing quality chef yasuda is very amiable and jocular but he is also a skilled salesman while talking to you and having you be distracted fresh prepared sushi would magically appear on your plate from nowhere he is so good stand outs in the matsu were the eel layers of flavor unlike any eel i have ever had in my life the shrimp prepared fresh which makes a very big difference in taste usually shrimp is a miss for me and actually everything else there was nothing i didnt like alotmy additional selections were the two recommended types of eel the orato and the arctic char with the latter two selections garnering a good choice from the master himself wow perfection achieved once again they even offer an inexpensive house hot sake which i thought paired well with all of the selections in fact i had two of thesewhat did i learn from talking with the master for nearly hours iron chef japan is just entertainmenttelevision they know the ingredients weeks in advance he deferred on naming other chefs that he likes but did say he likes bangers and mash he enjoys watching wwe wrestling doesnt follow sumo wrestling and really doesnt have time to watch movies he is onsite everyday for lunches and dinner if he takes time to travel he goes back to japan to visit his older ailing mother when he was younger he traveled in the western us particularly loving wyoming colorado and sedona arizona hes a country guy at heart he uses grains of rice both from sacramento in his sushi he never drinks on the job and doesnt find the practice respectful he can make sushi rolls in a minute his hands moved so fast i think he has a magic act on his days off sushi should be eaten with the fish facing up contrary to sushi union propaganda his term you dont eat a pizza upsidedown he says food for thought bad punand so much more he was so approachable and even posed for photos all around great experience and great guy price is surprisingly affordable only for my selections highly recommend

i feel small in new york all the time whether that has to do with people at work who are distinctly smarter than i or buildings that are taller than fifty of myself placed one on top of the other or witnessing people i know buying apartments that i know are well beyond my reach so why would i subject myself to the same effect from the spacious setting and super high ceilings of my neighborhood whole foods market here are ten likely reasonscheckout lines seriously fast with the express checkout smartly separated from the slower lines quite a change from columbus circlelocal crowd neighborhood regulars and friendly checkout clerks make for a pleasant shopping experiencesalad bar well marked and i dont fancy chickpeas mixed with shredded carrot as you might notice in chelseafree samples especially nice since no one is seemingly watching as i reach for a second helping as at trader joesmini carts i wonder why they retired them at the union square location a few months ago compact and convenientorganization by far the best organized whole foods location i could now do of my shopping blindfoldedupstairs seating i would guess an average occupancy of less than across my visits to datego figurelocation combine with a trip to the quietest barnes noble in town that is in the same building as whole foodsspacious feel try visiting during the morning or late evening hours you can breeze through the aisles and the checkoutfree mini bags if you are lucky you will find twoinch square brown bags at the customer service desk complete with handlesthere are a few evident shortcomings the staff is goodnatured but not sharp or quick the assortment is not as extensive as the bowery locations and you have to watch out for random babies running around trying to escape from the watchful eyes of their parents in tow but then at least that makes me feel big for a change

for a night i felt like a princess with her prince in a secret underground italian castle that is how bacaro gets down baby o perfect for a romantic date birthday dinner or a group of friends celebrating a special occasion a nicely hidden location off a quiet road in the downtown china town area you will feel as if your in a castle in the middle of new york city downstairs seating is a must perfected italian tapas an amazing wine selectionmy dining experience at bacaro is a night to be remembered i took my special someone here on his birthday and he was beyond surprised and impressed note to the guys you really want to look like you know your shit and impressromance a lady this place is a scorei arrived early to speak to the hostess about getting a nice table for two downstairs and having them set up a specially made birthday cake i had brought for him she was extremely helpful note they will charge you per person if you bring your own birthday treat but i just ordered an italian ice cream on their menu to go along with the caketips get there early weekdays are better i arrived only an hour after they opened they do not take reservations btw i was able to pick my choice of tables but only minutes after we seated the place was packed i will be sure to be back and most likely bring my parents a bit on the pricey side but not crazy i would suggest this place for special occasions o
i almost never go to queens which ill readily admit is probably my worst character flaw but everyone says that the best andor most authentic insert ethnicity here food comes from queens so im not only motivated to make the shlep in the interest of bettering myself as a person but also in the interest of eating some tasty food at low low pricesid been told that de mole was possibly the best mexican food in nyc and since it was in queens i imagined a holeinthewall full of seizureinducing flashing lights frantic music and colorful wall murals as it turns out de mole is a very pleasant and simple space much more reminiscent of something youd find on smith street than just a few blocks from queens boulevard ill have to agree with the masses here this is the best mexican ive had in new york i dont know what they do to make their salsa but it is magical our scallop ceviche was fresh and tangy and the salsa verde on my chicken enchiladas had the perfect spicy kick js shredded pork in a banana leaf was juicy and tender and the warm corn tortillas were so good we had to get a second serving for which we were only charged an astounding fifty cents fifty cents and our server was like really concerned that we understood that wed have to pay fifty cents if we wanted more tortillas we assured him that we could handle the surchargewhich brings me to the prices here its a little ridiculous how cheap everything for a burrito enchiladas my jaw just dropped when i opened the menu and my wallet did a little dance of joy in my bag when i whispered to it that it wouldnt go home empty at the end of the night the ceviche plus a giant carafe of sangria plus our entrees came to pp after tax and tip i freaking love queens thanks to de mole i am now well on my way to being a less flawed person
its all good thats the writing on the wallit took me months and close to half a dozen visits to realize that luzzos is absolutely my favorite pizza in manhattan it might be because i am more culturally attuned to new york style pizza than to neapolitan style pizza it might also be that i didnt appreciate its simplistic genius the first few times and all too often humility is an underappreciated virtue surrounded by many big names in pizza and in all the hoopla created by the choke it was easy to overlook luzzosironically i discovered luzzos by accident i had planned a get together of friends at the nearby una pizza napoletana without realizing that they were closed for the day prodded by hunger we took a chance at this unassuming restaurant nearby which had the rustic feel of a small caf√© in italy as we conversed with the servers we realized from the language barrier that this indeed was the real deal all the servers and the pizzaioli were italian and by that i do not mean from italy by way of staten island yes i am looking at you artichoke i liked luzzos pizza then but at that time i wasnt sure that i loved it the texture of the pizza was soft and chewy it was thin but not crispy except at the edges charred by the coal oven the crust was definitely unique the sauce was simple sweet and tangy and made perhaps from canned tomatoes the creamy mozzarella di buffala was the star extremely fresh and uniquely presented in the shape of large polka dots all over the pizza it was exquisitely light and deliciousbut i wasnt sold on the crust used to the crispier nyc version i found the pizza chewy and at times a little bland over a period of time i got to appreciate the fact that this pizza was perfectly executed per neapolitan standards a well made pizza in naples is described as one where you can fold the pizza in half and then again into quarters without cracking or breaking the crust this is definitely the case with luzzos which is one of the most pliant in the city also the pizzaioli have started charring the crust more making better use of the coal oven so now not only do you have the desired chewiness but the crust is also crisper and with a number of bubbles i have struggled with this five star rating one of the problems of authenticity is challenges in communication at times my pizza order has been delayed because the multiple servers havent coordinated well between them i have also found the pastiera italian cake made with ricotta cheese and candied fruit to be refrigerated and not as texturally complex as other versions in the city i also fear that they will be unable to handle the crowds as their fame spreads in short their management skills are untestedbut in mirroring the mood of the country i decided to overlook my present fears and concerns about their ability to deliver in the future and bumped them up to five stars i can not fault them for authenticity genius and flair heck i can even overlook a martha stewart endorsement for that
heres a cute little story for youmarch my birthday we step out of the cab at and right smack in gritty east village i think oh god i hope hes not taking me to grays papaya on this corner we walk down street it was a lovely evening where are we goingjust tell me i inquire no just keep walking were almost there we pass momofuku noodle bar packed with diners slurping down hot bowls of designer ramen and stuffing themselves silly with succulent pork buns doused in hoisin david chang styleand then he stops dramatic musiche opens the door happy birthdayas some of you may know i have a foodie slash love obsession with david chang id sleep with him yes i said it theres nothing sexier about a man than a man who can cook and loves bacon two important qualities i seek in the opposite sex scoring a reservation at ko is akin to a grail quest i have spent countless minutes refreshing their reservation page in hopes of stumbling upon a vaunted green check mark but to no avail my mouse clicking skills evidently need improvement in my head i had built ko up to be some sort of culinary nirvana it wasafter my many squeals of delight we were seated i was practically drooling in anticipation and keenly observing all the action going on behind the counter the chefs were extremely nice and chatted with us about each dish and answered all my inane courses later wine pairings later i was happy extremelyhighlights of the mealshaved foie gras torchon with riesling jelly and brittle hands down favorite course of the night i have read about this dish so many times that i could practically taste it via yelp reviews the juxtaposition of textures were absolutely incredible the mounds of foie gras melted in your mouth while the brittle gave it a simultaneous crunch the sweet and savory flavors were sublime together melding into perfection to me this dish was innovative and thoughtfulpork belly with kimchi consomme and grilled rice the infamous david chang pork belly if there is one protein that i could eat on a daily basis it would be pork belly the skin was perfectly crispy and smoky the protein tender with the appropriate overload of fatthe consomme was absolutely delicious and complimented the grilled rice cube and belly nicely it was a simple dish but with perfect executionfluke with buttermilk understated but bursting with flavor and texture as one of the earlier courses it whetted my palate for all the amazing dishes to come elegant and simple yet ultimately satisfyingsteak with artichoke puree jalapenos and cauliflower the meat was perfectly prepared to a tender and succulent medium rare the accompaniment of the jalapeno sauce was so perfect i was skeptical at first of this pairing but once i put it in my mouth thats what she said it made sense it just worked it was intricate but prepared so flawlessly funnel cake with black sesame ice cream i thought it was very clever to end this elegant course meal with funnel cake funnel cake brings back memories of fairs and amusement parks this was like funnel cake on steroids deep fried dough topped with powdered sugar and served alongside black sesame ice cream and cream divinethe wine pairings were spot on in my opinion not a winesspirits connoisseur by any means i thought the pairings were thoughtful and well balanced and well i got drunki really could not ask for a better birthday meal my mouse clicking inferiority complex was worth it ko lives up to the hype if you love food youll love ko
with its impressive outside sign and massive seafood tank everett gets kudos for standing out amongst the chinese businesses along avenue but more importantly gets my nod for the best chinese restaurant in brooklyn chinatown there are few places that can emulate the quality of selection everett has to offer i cant think any establishment in the area that has a more extensive menu of seafood and fujian style specialties to add to that they have fast service excellent prices and feature a splendid decoras i mentioned in my previous review everything about the restaurant almost distinctly caters to a chinese crowd menu selection cctv news and even the karaoke but i have seen some nonchinese in here on occasion the waitresses do speak some english but coming with someone who may speak mandarin would likely help the dining experience tremendouslythe dishes just keep getting better and better during each visit there is no question the food is of superior quality with plenty of flavor and freshness and can cater to a variety of palates there are some standard cantonese northern chinese dishes available as well but i advise most folks to get a little adventurous and order their homestyle dishes ie steamed mantis shrimp fukinese king crab etc especially the ones that are less likely to be found in other establishments on a whole this place is hard to miss and even harder to pass up for folks who can appreciate true authentic cuisine the sign on the outside glows into the night while all of the tiny markets and bakeries close for the after hours though the place looks deceivingly small upon entering there is also a basement level a la congee village for big groups who want a private dining experience they are open late but the best time to go is during the dinner hour and even better if one can score a table on the weekend

the highly sought after best pizza in new york has rendered a trip to the island of staten where it plays host to deninos pizzeria tavern despite the toll faced with having to cross the verrazano the hefty tariff was paid to experience the highly acclaimed offerings of this establishmentthe establishment segmented into four primary sections the feel of deninos resembles a local neighborhood bar wood tables with metal chairs aides in the simplistic d√©cor of this establishment theres not much to comment on in terms of d√©cor the establishment is really simplistic as patrons of deninos are here more for the pizza than that of the experience of the d√©corthe foodappetizer fried calamari in lieu of the simplistic presentation which consisted of a heap of calamari and small containers of tomato sauce the taste and boldness derived from the application was exquisite the textural contrast between the crispy fried peripheral complemented the smooth and soft nature of the calamari the taste too complimented the textural composition of the application light hints of salt and garlic played well in both taste and aromatics of the application patrons ordering the fried calamari will find that the simplistic nature but bold taste and texture of the calamari will render second ordersappetizer mozzarella sticks the concept of adding a saturated fat to a consumable that already contains saturated fat derives phantoms of debauchery in the mental equilibrium nevertheless i speak with high regard that the mozzarella sticks at deninos is by far the best ive had up to this point of my existence the lightly breaded and deep fried mozzarella is served with a side of tomato sauce at first consumption patrons will find that the italian seasoning used in the breading of the outer exterior complements the smooth milky texture of the inner confines that holds the mozzarella the mozzarella itself produced a mild sweetness thats greatly aided by the velvety texture for which it was derived the centerpiece of the application is derived from the proper balance of the savory mozzarella thats complemented with the mild saltiness from the italian seasoning given the complexity of the crispy exterior while maintaining the integrity of the confined mozzarella the application in both taste and presentation is strikingly impressivepizza margherita pizza the staple in sampling the renderings of a pizzeria the margherita not only met our highest aspirations but inspired a humbling appreciation for the technique and execution of deninos application the margherita starts with a medium thick crust one thats slightly thicker than your average thin crust that plays host to a layering of san marzano tomato sauce and sliced fresh mozzarella the application is finished off with a hefty sprinkling of fresh basil at first taste the charred smokiness of the pizza crust was the keynote of the application the slightly burnt crust which hinted notes of bitterness worked in conjunction with the bold flavorings of the tomato sauce the application was further aided by the sweet and velvety texture of the fresh mozzarella the last trifle thats noted in the application is the earthiness derived from the fresh basil all of the elements of the application ranging from the mild hint of pepper in the tomato sauce to the perfectly cooked crust added another dimension to the quality of this pizza despite the urge to detect a flaw of this application it was easy to say that deninos pizza did not possess such a flaw everything ranging from the use of ingredients cooking techniques and taste were met with great satisfactionpizza garbage pizza the application consists of a heavy coating of mozzarella not fresh sausage pepperoni mushroom and onion works in concurrence to produce a slightly heartier pizza than its counterpart the margherita dop at first bite the elements that were first observed are that of the toppings used in the application the aromatics stemming from the italian sausage was complemented by heat and spiciness of the pepperoni both of these elements became the predominant factor in the consumption process as the crispy and clean taste of the mushroom and onion became an afterthought all elements of the pizza crust sauce and cheese acted as a stage for the toppings used in this application the pizza provided a subtle balance of doughy texture to the meaty nature of this application patrons will find that the flavor renderings of salt heat and tart are the key components to this application certainly the garbage pizza is one most appreciated by the meat lovers in all of usknow before you cash beers are to a wait time varies minutes to recommended margherita cost per person to

how do you write a review without sounding too gushy i dont know i tried to rewrite mine about casellula three times before i realized my gushing was completely called for all those in favor of fawning say cheeseit was freezing when my double date group arrived and we were eager for a table to warm up at with a bottle of wine it was a crowded friday night so brian the owner gladly made room for us at the bar and set us up with some goat cheese hazelnut truffles i had to capitalize that as my group pounced on them the way a lion would pounce on a baby elk with ferocity and lipsmacking enjoymentwe ordered a bottle of muscadet and some snacks the olives and pickles were great to munch on and the other couple particularly loved the cheesestuffed jalapeno peppers we swirled and sniffed and snacked and chatted falling in love with the warm atmosphere in casellula maybe it was the wine maybe it was the cheese maybe it was cold winter evening but we left a little fuller a little drunker and just a little more romantic
there is nothing i could say about this fantastic place that hasnt already been said so instead i will review the people who were using their mobile phonespresumably this is a special occasion place you come here to propose you come here to celebrate you come here because on the xthousandth occasion of your wife mentioning how much shed like to go there you finally get the hint so you sell shares of exxon and make reservations two months in advancethis place is a complete experience from the moment youre greeted until the moment you receive the bill and stagger out in a state of shock the service is unparalleled and the food is exquisiteso you would think you might just once put the phone awayour starter was someone who i kept calling ralph fiennes because he looked a lot like ralph fiennes he was on his mobile phone for more than half his meal he had an attractive exterior but i felt his soul was a bit lacking and his manners were too salty he had the wherewithal to keep his conversation quiet as if muttering to a mistress but that doesnt change the fact that rather than experiencing per se he was working on growing a brain tumor i hope when they returned home his companion denied him sex before setting him on firefor an entr√©e we enjoyed the couple preoccupied with texting perhaps theyd asked the babysitter to deliver a playbyplay on twitter barely a word was muttered between them ultimately i found they lacked substance and left a bitter aftertastefor dessert there was the guy who doesnt know how to turn his ringer off he was uninspired and pedestriani would definitely come here again preferably when the stock market bounces back and mannerdeficient humanity is wiped out by a megavirus
andre biggums standing up in a peanut butter anonymous meeting ive been addicted to peanut butter ever since i turned my younger brother is allergic to peanuts so my parents forbid me from ever having any in my first year of college my roommate came home late with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich he asked if i wanted a piece and i figured that i was just experimenting at first i told myself that i would only eat pbjs on the weekends then i started eating them on mondays and before you knew it i was completely addicted to pbjs and i was eating them everyday i stopped going to class got kicked out of school and had to go back home where i started stealing money and stuff around the house to get my peanut butter fix my parents kicked me out and i was forced to sleep in washington square park this is where i found other pbj junkies like myself they took me to peanut butter co now you can find me passed out on a park bench holding a peanut butter blt

hurrying out of the station i am met with the busy traffic of broadway i wait patiently for the light to change and when it does scurry across the intersection and into grays papaya its just a hot dog i know its a simple hot dog from a garishly decorated store but this little corner store is one of my favorite places to say that i love this place because its cheap and delicious would be an understatement but more than anything i am utterly devoted to this tiny hot dog shop because its when im standing at the counter with a hot dog and a papaya drink in hand watching the cars streak across on broadway that i am most conscious that i am in new york i like standing at the counter facing broadway and watching the busy lives of new york scrambling by i like waving at the police officer in his dark suit with a shiny badge as he strolls past the large window i like laughing to myself as a pedestrian yells profanity to a reckless cab driver right on and broadway i like how grays papaya is always playing classic rock i like the dusty and dirty paper fruits hanging from the ceiling its so tacky and cheesy that its awesome i like how the folks working here wear pins that say i am a polite new yorker i like chuckling to myself as i hear the new yorker groan in frustration as the tourist customer takes forever while ordering i like the all the strange characters that come to this store at all hours of the day i like new york and i like these hot dogs these little hot dogs changed my perspectives on franks and sausages prior to grays papaya ive lived by the adage that the bigger the wiener the better in fact the sausage of choice for my buns was the big fat irish banger get your dirty mind out of the gutter you pervert so when i got my first grays hot dog i remember looking at it suspiciously wondering what the hype is about such a skinny little wiener but after the first bite ive come to realize that size does not matter it was grays that taught me the beauty of a snappy hot dog is there any greater joy than biting into a hot little frank and feeling the casing snap and as someone who probably ate her weight in grays papaya three times over heres a confession i did not get a monthly mta pass for the month of march in an effort to curb my wiener appetite after i realized that i went to grays papaya times in one week i can say that these hot dogs will be snappy every single time and the grays papaya hot dog doesnt just stop at the casing after that beautiful snap it gets even better as the perfectly grilled beef franks ooze meaty juice and the meat itself is so damn tasty too though it may not have fancy seasoning its simplicity perfected i always get the recession special two hot dogs and a drink i always get papaya that thing is quite delicious too and helps me delude myself that my diet of grays papaya days a week isnt completely unhealthy for is a steal even if they had raised the prices from is cheaper than a gallon of gas a box of cereal a carton of strawberries and a bottle of water at some places as i said i love new york and i love these hot dogs oh you bet your little wieners i wrote my review about hot dogs did you expect anything less from someone whose getting todays rotd for writing about bull penis

like many other ramen fiends in nyc i had been eagerly anticipating the opening of ippudo for some time after reading all the glowing reviews that quickly came in the anticipation was reaching a crescendo yet something was holding me back from making the special trip there i suppose i feared that the reviews were overrated and ippudo would be overhyped like ramen setegaya and momofuku were for mealas i can happily say that ippudo lived up to its hype and deserves all the high praise its been receiving from ramen aficionados going at lunchtime is a great way to avoid waiting on the hr lines that ive been hearing about i came in after and was quickly seated at a nearly empty communal round table which gave me a front row glimpse into the kitchen the bamboo tree that shaded me was a nice touch and reminded me of a bamboo sculpture i had seen at the ny botanical garden last fall the raised hiragana on the walls was also really cool although im incredibly rusty with my japanese and couldnt make any sense of itbut youre not really coming to ippudo for the decor or ambiance are you honestly if ippudo was another holeinthewall ramen joint like many others in the city youd still be happy to slurp up every last drop of your soup because damn is that broth fantastic its so rich and thick with flavor i believe it when they say that they simmer their pork bones for hours i had the akamaru ramen which came with extra special sauce the pork slices melted in my mouth and there were bits of ground pork canoodling with my noodles there was only one drop of soup left in my bowl by the time i was done and thats only because i was too embarrassed to lift the bowl to my mouth i usually dont bother finishing the soup when i eat ramen because im too full but there is such a nice balance of pork noodle and broth that you dont feel like a glutton lapping it all up best of all i didnt even feel bloated afterwards just satisfiedaside from the amazing ramen the overall experience at ippudo is very pleasant the service is typically japanese prompt courteous and efficient they also serve complimentary tea at the end of your meal when i was finishing my first cup and they thought that i was lingering they brought me another one which was unexpected but appreciated ippudo definitely tops my ramen list and the wait was well worth it and when you think about it is a small price to pay for a genuinely delicious taste of japanps add the braised pork belly to your ramen for its melt in your mouth yummy

let me preface this review by saying this i love meat a lot now that being said we can continue heres some other things i love things that taste like meat andre small restaurants spontaneous late night adventures nyc yelp bookmarks andre yelp whats hot section andre tapas spontaneous late night adventures with my boyfriend andre involving a small restaurant we both bookmarked from yelps nyc whats hot section that creates tapas sized dishes with tofu that taste like meat so at at night when andre woke me up to take a trip to kyotofu i was all about it what i first observed is its a very modern intimate space two walls facing opposite of each other thats all so if you think of bringing more then people i would call very early in the day to accommodate your party even late in the evening our waiter joseph provided us with exemplary service and allowed us to take our time enjoying the dishes honestly if it wasnt tofu im not sure i would have ate as much as i did i mean seriously mac and cheese chicken sliders bbq unagi after midnight no way plus i still had room for a sweet potato cheese cakehave your cake and eat it too is literally the theme here we loved it so much here we practically kidnapped our friends kev and natasha the next day and brought them to experience it sunday is sake sunday off bottles and brunch comes with free mimosasbellinis so you can imagine the awesome time we had in my opinion ive always left thinking the bill was reasonable for the amount of food drinks we had ppl after experiencing kyotofu my bf and i have definitely considered incorporating more protein packed tofu into our diets im sure this place will be a regular feelgood spot of ours for awhile

all in all as jails go queens central booking was not the worst ive ever gone through being chauffered in a luxurious crown vic i arrived at the side door just in time to see a long line of celebrities and debutantes parade into this magnificent epitome of institutional architecture the sheer excitement that coursed through my veins brought a shiver to my spine and a rapid girding of my loins i was in the midst of greatness true unadulterated greatnessi was ushered through the front room where i was graciously greeted by the meticulously uniformed staff kind words and accolades every step of the way i could tell right then and there that this was going to be a special stayonce my reservation was processed i was shown to my accommodations i have never seen anything so welcoming and bowelloosening relaxing the other guests were friendly and very willing to share the copious space throughout our highceilinged room bright and airy with an entire wall of fine iron latticework i was pleasantly surprised to find the rustic bathroom was right there for our use there would be no running down a long hallway or having to open a pesky door when the need arose oh no nothing as philistine as thatand the food oh the glorious delicious spread that was laid before us i salivate at the memory my stomach churns for the delicious prospect of skim milk and bran cereal for breakfast skim milk and bologna on oat bran bread for lunch and dinner let me just say dinner was a epicurean delight that still brings tears to my eyes meat loaf so grey and bouncy served with the fluffiest most processed white rice that even wolfgang puck would have sucked dick for a second helping now let me just explain the meat loaf it was meat all kinds of meat but mostly the kind of meat that you would run from were it still aliveall in all i had a wonderful experience here and truly look forward to going back in say five to ten

mexican cuisineour first mother daughter saturday date for picked up the place as usual she relied on the reviews of our famous yelpers and we were not disappointed with and stars you cant losewe took the train to stbliss station and walked minutes to reach this well reviewed restaurant the corner place was small seats but tastefully decorated with a huge mirror on one side and a gigantic picture of a big apple on the other brick side wall there are a couple of hanging lights very cozy and simple a small bar is in one corner each table has tea lights and they have one waiter the place was half full or was it half empty when we arrived but a couple of peoplecame in right after as soon as we were seated i ordered the guacamole while browsing over the menu it was delicious we also had the ceviche de veracruzdiced sea scallops with fresh lime juice diced red onion tomatoesjalapenos avocadocucumbercilantro and drenched in olive oil really good we finished everything camille ordered their special skirt steak mole with rice and beans and i had the chuleta de puerco grilled porkchop with caramelized onions yellow rice black beans and tortillas the origin of these unique mexican dishes is obscure but its probably a very good guess that they are of mestizo spanishamerindian inspiration created out of he need to make a filling meal from whatever could be afforded and kept on hand tortillas beans rice noodleslike her music mexicos food is sometimes hot sometimes sweet sometimes a blending of both but it is never dullalthough we were both fulland had no more space for a postre dessert we capped our meal with an order of pastel de tres leches a fitting finale for an exciting cuisinecamille wont stop talking about it on our way homei have to shut her up i stopped by this mexican grocery and bought a bottle of molei have to try it homeoppssomething very important that i inadvertently missedthe prices are very affordable for all that we hadthe bill came uip to plus tip of course
i take yelp recommendations very very seriously so when lan zhou handmade noodles repeatedly was at the top of the most reviewed list i knew i had to make the trip to the labyrinth that is chinatowninconspicuous and neatly camouflaged against the bustling chinatown backdrop lan zhou is truly an indubitable hole in the wallsmall groups and single diners came in and out at a steady stream slurping steaming bowls of hot handpulled noodle soups and scarfing down freshly crafted boiled and fried dumplings my friend and i tried the oxtail noodle soup and the beef brisket noodle soup with an order of boiled dumplings and an order of fried dumplings the noodles were perfectly al dente doughy and comforting the broth was delightfully salty and savory tons of msg my body will decompose nicely when im dead and the portions were huge i am not a light eater by any means and there was still a hefty pile of noodles in my bowl at the end of the meal the dumplings were so good for lack of eloquency all i can say is that they were the bombcom no soy sauce needed my friendsso two bowls of noodles orders of dumplings one diet coke and one regular coke i still like to think of myself as a poor degenerate college student so this meal was a stealthis place is awesome game over
from the moment i began writing reviews in new york clinton street baking company was like a little wart that would never go away i would see constant reminders in publications or reviews online or even casual questions posed my way in conversations regarding this place it was an eventual item on my toeat list something that i knowingly would have tried even if it would take me years upon first glance the place seems hardly impressive there is little seating for more than a group of and corners tight enough to rub elbows with neighboring patrons i ventured a look at the menu which didnt have much as much variety as i would have expected in a place so popular with such little space and a simple menu is this kind of establishment really worth paying a premium for regardless of all of the negatives and disastrous maybes there had to be a reason why people would wait so long to eat here it couldnt be the trendiness as there was none and it wasnt the hipster vibe because its too expensive i sucked it up braved the hour wait and encouraged my appetite to try what many people have longed for every weekendthe foodgasm i encountered with every bite of my first experience was incredible it was an impression that would not soon be forgotten and the type that is hard to shake off after months this was unlike most brunches ive had where the taste was impeccable and released all of my inhibitions to devour everything on my plate gone were the thoughts of eating healthy and raised my suspicions about how there must be crack in this delicious caramel maple syrup i am not a fan of pancakes but i couldnt stop eating the ones here surely the hashbrowns are not the shredded kind but theyre as wonderful as the fluffy eggs that i couldnt stop admiring even my pulp filled oj was great and that says a lotit has been several visits since and each time i have yet to leave disappointed ive sampled everything from the lobster blt to the southern style breakfast with a moan from each bite its true the prices dont merit a cheap brunch but in the end this place is worthy of at least one visit i agree that a hour wait is ridiculous so i propose they buy out the empty thai place next door and just knock down the wall this way the wait would be only minutes at best
i love di palos with a passion but the lines are sometimes unbearableit is with this simple reason alone that i stumbled into alleva located directly at the opposite end of the blockat first entry the modestly decorated storefront and outside display windows of the establishment did not dictate the eye catching notoriety of its east end counterpart nevertheless as most italian cooks know its the quality of the product that dictates the integrity of business not the glamour for which its presented the inside of the establishment is reflected directly by the store front do not expect any state of the art technology refrigerators nor focused lighting at this establishment allevas interior is cascaded by bright white walls which enhances the products of the establishment patrons will discover to their immediate left after entry italian cured meats ranging from proscuitto both di san danielle di parma and sweet spicy sopressata are on fully display for order to the immediate right patrons will be captivated by display of hand prepped fresh mozzarella sun dried tomatoes in extra virgin olive oil fresh mozzarella salad and olive bar at the center imported italian extra olive oil as well as various types of pasta are available for purchase the store itself is modest in size and displays each of their products well patrons will find that the setting of the establishment allows for a comfortable shopping experiencegranted i only bought two items from alleva but its still worth commentingfresh mozzarella at first glance the textural and color composition of the fresh mozzarella is similar to that of any of the same kind of course frequent users of this freshly packed cheese understand that despite the simplistic deception of visual perception it is ultimately the substantial feel and taste of the product that dictates a well made fresh mozzarella i proceeded to grab a fresh mozzarella ball resembled that in size of one pound the textural composition of the cheese is semifirm thus indicating that the cheese was prepped and packed by hand most mass produced fresh mozzarella is packed using machine compression to help alleviate the excess water in their product sadly this process causes the texture of the fresh mozzarella to be excessively difficulty to eat due to imbalanced ratio of cheese to water luckily the fresh mozzarella found at alleva has the proper firmness and delicate texture required for such an application during the initial tasting it was evident that the aromatic scent and pure milky flavor texture of the fresh mozzarella provided a cleansing to the palate the proper balance of liquor to solids ratio in the application allowed for the taste of the cheese to flourish by having properties best described as being in melts in your mouth category the delicate and soft texture of the cheese allowed for the fresh milk and earthy flavors to embody the taste buds thus enhancing the purity of the product with each additional bite consumers will find that the fresh mozzarella at alleva can be ranked as one of the freshest and best tasting they will find around little italy manhattansweet sopressata as with most cured meats excessive amounts of salt applied during the curing process can produce both an eradication of the product as well as distaining the taste of that product with overwhelming saltiness luckily the sopressata available at alleva did not attract either of these two qualities the sweet sopressata was lightly cured which produced a mild saltiness thus allowing for the various spices and texture of sausage to be abundantly present the smooth texture of the sausage derived directly from the abundance of fat enhances the quality and textural composition of the meat biting into the sopressata produces a profound joy in that the meat is delicate in texture yet brash in taste through the proper use of spices and execution during the creation and curing process consumers will find this particular sopressata to be delicate and friendly to the palate rather that than harsh and unwelcoming in addition the sopressata was lightly more delicate in firmness than that of the many counterparts i found this to be unique but welcoming as the application for which i am to use this meat required crumbling the softness also greatly aided the taste of the sopressata by allowed for the consumer to do less work during the consumption process each of the aspects observed from this cured meat were welcoming and profoundtwo products and cents later a new discovery was had although di palos has the notoriety through its newly acquired celebrity status allevas simplicity in d√©cor and extensive attention to detail and execution allows for its product to speak on its behalf frequent customers of allevas know that for first grade product this is the establishment to visit
imagine a quaint family owned butcher shop in a tiny italian village imagine fidgety children placated with slices of sopressatta and a smile now exchange the euros for the dollar united meat market is as clean and pristine as mrs parks bulgogi operating room seriously you could eat off the floorwhen we lived in windsor terrace we were frequent customers if they didnt have something you could special order itmr unlucky ordered duck once which was fabulous but a confounded nuisance to cook i still come here when my family has a hankering for meat loaf because the ingredients procured here have always pleased our rather particular palates they also offer a small but thoughtful selection of italian products sometimes i am badgered into buying fresh ravioli and lovely sauces by more persistent family memberslamentably mrs parks sublime bulgogi resides in newton massachusetts fortunately the united meat market is but a few hops skips and jumps away from kensington
oh lordy chicken and wafflesthe first time i ever had chicken and waffles i must admit i was quite the skeptic i get the whole meat plus carbs thing its like a breakfast chicken sandwich if you think about it but top it off with hot sauce and syrup i dont know guys but one bite later i began to wonder why none of my southern california friends having grown up with roscoes chicken and waffles had shared this wonderful little secret with me an unknowing northern californian sooner when i moved to new york i made sure to find a nice southern comfort food restaurant to call my own just my luck i ended up scoring an apartment a mere five blocks away from amy ruthsim a creature of habit so the reverend al sharpton chicken and waffles plain and simple white meat fried is my goto platter every time ive tried the yams mac and cheese and mashed potatoes all of which are hella good amy ruths serves up the best sweet tea ive ever had and i cant ever remember koolaid tasting so good my favorite flavor is red but come on whos isnt the free cornbread they dole out while you wait is an amazing precursor to the food to come serving sizes are on the larger side so come on an empty stomach or plan on taking a doggie bag home with you open to pm most days open to am on fridays and saturdaysevery time i visit amy ruths im sleepy by the end of the meal talk about your comfort food i love it
dear little branchim sorry i stole the straws it was ambiguous to me as to whether or not youd want them back and they were so cute and fun and oldtimeyi just couldnt resist slipping one into my bag welltwo alright fine maybe i feel horrible for doing this to you after all youve done for me do you remember the first time we met it was an unusually sultry saturday night late last spring and i got to sit down in a booth right away because your ac was broken and no one wanted to sit in the sweltering heat crazy night huh one sip of your mint julep though and it was as if a cool breeze had passed through the bar so icy and delicious i truly had not known such refreshment ever beforeand since then youve been nothing short of spectacular when it comes to picking just the right drink for me beyond summers mint juleps youve given me archangels and gingin mules in the fall red hooks and hot buttered rums in the wintercant wait to see what spring has in store that is of course if youll pardon my petty thievery i could bring the straws back but that might be weird it would right please just accept my deepest apologies along with this public declaration that you are my favorite bar ever very truly yoursdr becca
warning this review is not going to be a hoitytoity gourmet praise kind with words like exquisite and delectable instead im going to really break it down for you and it might even come across as downright ghetto not gangsta or poor english like but ill probably disgrace the chefs by really cheapening the foodits my birthday today and all weekend i had been dreaming of knish froyo cookies and pies the momofuku bakery seemed to have all those things and i was really curious if any baked good could taste as good as their pork bun it would be a real winner so i geared up mentally prepared myself for the slush and cold and went on a mission after workthe momofuku bar was practically empty the whole take a number ticket was unnecessary and the people behind the counter were really nice and super chill the place is simple bar tables chalkboard menu pay station and hot food area i was a little overwhelmed by the glass case i had a plan this weekend and when i saw everything my brain cells became confused i asked for a sample of the graham soft serve it was a hella big sample im not one to complain but after having the free taste i was interested in the soft serve no more great consistency horrible flavor too sweet euh not my thing im such a red mango girl anyhow the sweetness of the soft serve highlighted all the goo in the pies this immediately out ruled things like the candy bar pie and crack i went with the chocolate cake compost cookie and after glancing back up at the chalkboard menu i added a volcano to my orderhold up for a bun this is where the argument of paying for a cupcake can not hold a flame to paying for a piece of bread aughhh i hate how living in ny has created a standard of high completely reasonable i didnt bat an eye i took my goodies to go but before i left i took a peek at my volcano um the thing was oozing of white stuff i guess thats why they call it volcano i was going home with a clam chowder bread bowlfast forward to home where i break into this volcano im savage i dont use utensils the thing is cut in half thank god because it is so damn big and after the pizza party at work today i didnt think i had any more space for all the carbs just a tastearhgh argijsjg crunchg shsoisgo imagine all the rich comfort foods at your fingertips hot bread crusted cheese potato au gratin bacon caramelized onions alfredo yea you heard me i just called the gruyere cheese alfredo sauce wheres the linguini might as well throw some clams in there too while youre at it chef christina and marian im so mean i just insulted your haute bun but it was amazing the little snack turned into my din din and i just feasted on every fat rich comfort food memory i had stored in my tastebuds on to the cookie i call it the kitchen sink its got everything in it and its so rich and buttery savory and sweet the next time i bake cookies im gonna dust off my counters and pull all the junk out of the couch to serve as the secret ingredient im sure cheetos and basil will make excellent accents if you can do it with pretzels and potato chips i surely can with orange doodles and herb remnantsand since it is my birthday i did my best impression of nigella lawson by going into the kitchen in the dark taking a fork and stabbing it into the cake forget hygiene and manners take out and leftovers in the fridge were meant to be dug at and destroyed i almost drank the milk out of the milk carton too but the fat free milk was my roommates i need a little bit goes a long way from the momofuku bakery i think it is tons better than batch even if they dont have old ladies what old lady norm
i came here on friday night with a friend who also happens to be a girl i think it was the second night that the eatery had been open we had reservations at pm and were seated accordingly the decor is very modern urban clean and sleek dark woods and unique scandinaviantype furniture characterize this restaurant my dining companion pointed out the most interesting design feature or at least in my opinion of the entire restaurant the light fixtures on the walls they gave the appearance of a chandelier but they were really just a clear plastic of sorts that permitted light to shine through to create the illusion of a chandelier due to the inaugural weekend some details still had yet to be ironed out with the service the service was exceptional but borderline overkill at times some of the help was running around like chickens with their heads cut off i would liken the awkwardness to the in between hugkiss that you give a girl after a first date you know you both lean in but you arent drunk enough to put your lips on hers and you dont want her to think that youre a pigerr wait no that never happens we prompted our waitress for a dry white wine option and she knocked it out of the park with her recommendation the food was delicious my besty and i shared an appetizer of mussels which were quite good i was expecting mussels because the place appeared to be quite upscale but to my pleasant surprise it was a mountain o mussels and they were delicious we both decided on fish for dinner she had the crusted halibut with broccoli and eggplant i had the shrimp and scallops in a white wine and butter sauce with white kidney beans both dishes were spectacular marked by appropriate portions exceptional flavoring and perfect preparationi cant take credit for choosing this place because im hickish now im not saying im a hick im just hickish when it comes to this type of dining luckily she has a refined taste and knows where to dine for special occasions i would definitely come back here note to the devoted minority that reads my babble regularly thanks for doing so i apologize but i will not be reviewing quite as frequently
boxcar is like the acquaintance from college who you suddenly find yourself out with all the time because they live a few blocks away from you and sometimes you bump into each other when youre wasted and looking for guacamole at the bodega and youre like hey man we should hang out more so you do and you remember how awesome college was and dont know why you didnt hang out with them back in school maybe because you ran in different circles or maybe because you were on too many drugs but it doesnt matter because now youre practically best friends and you know thank god because who else is going to sit around and swig beer with you at on a monday night
my friend e likes to tease me about being so outrageous and out of control as in he jokes that a wild and crazy time for me includes things like the third hour of monopoly and asparagus well you know what throw in an afternoon at bh while youre at it i have the potential to be amused by all the camera options for a substantial amount of timeill just be underneath the overhead conveyor beltsmiling no big deal and no im not autistic

i hesitate to write a review of da bhang because i know that the inevitable crowdedness of a cafe like this is directly proportional to the number of positive yelp reviews it receives think grounded but im simply too anal retentive not to include this in my write spot listand im sure im going to pay for that bit of ocd in the endda bhang is indeed an ideal place to get some work done its a great alternative when grounded is too packed which is almost always during the day it doesnt get terribly crowded so you can easily score a spot on the cushioned bank seating the space is clean sleek and modern and doesnt feel cramped or cluttered like some other cafes i appreciate that they didnt feel compelled to squeeze in as many tables as they could just to utilize the minimal space i have been in larger cafes that feel smaller due to thisthere isnt a whole lot of natural lighting since its lower than street level and goes deep rather than wide but if you sit by the giant window in the front youll be fine the lighting further in is actually pretty good and probably helped by the light wall color the bathroom is well maintained and wheelchairaccessible although the cafe itself isnt they tend to play soothing jazz music thats not too distracting although the whiff of waffles cooking is id take that tempting scent any day over coffee brewing since i dont drink the stuff as a bonus you wont smell like coffee for the rest of the day the turkey and brie sandwich i ordered seemed pricey at but since they panini press it for you and include a salad its not a bad deal and if youre a student you can take advantage of a discountthe vibe changes a bit after when the lights get dimmer and it starts to get busier with the dinner crowd i wouldnt think to eat dinner here since they have more of a lunch menu with the exception of bi bim bap but i guess people like indulging in waffles in the evening i was surprised to see how it went from writing spot to hot spot once the sun came down but the vibecrowd change lets me know that ive already spent several hours there and its time to head home luckily the staff is very friendly and doesnt seem to mind table squatters like myselfin short da bhang is da bomb sorry i couldnt resist
some moons ago i was dating a chef who had some connections here and we would frequent this place i feel very fortunate for that because i think that ordinarily this restaurant is quite expensivethe service and the food here is very professional and excellent we always started out with some sake or other libations at the bar afterwards we would order the japanese pickles which are really really good here finally we would order some amazing delicacy for dinner which always left me jonesing to come back again soonone of my favorite dishes here is something that i unfortunately cant remember the name of however it was a whole fish that was artistically skewered and grilled afterwards the delicate bones are taken back to the kitchen fried and brought back to the table to eat something like softshell crab only yummiera wonderful restaurant when the economy turns around andor i find myself gainfully employed i will return here with my debit card and pay full price since i will be sans chefconnection highly recommended

this place has been there since before i can remember i grew up in the neighborhood but didnt come here frequently there was another kosher deli closer to where i lived but that closed downbens is a relic a tribute to a time before we cared about being fat or heart disease or dying young as my grandmother told me your greatgrandfather dug his own grave with a knife and fork places like bens provide the shoveli have an aunt who still lives in forest hills i took her here two saturdays ago for her birthday as all kosher delis do they start you out with a plate of pickles and coleslaw the food here is standard kosher deli chow and we all ordered pretty much the same thing in front of me was a mountainous sandwich to be more accurate it was a thin slice of rye with four inches of pastrami covered with another thin slice of rye to this i add a swirl of mustard if you are thinking mayo would be great on that please meet me at port authority bus station and i will gladly buy you a oneway ticket back to ohio the pastrami was excellent i was actually surprised expecting it to just be mediocre it was lean but not dry and tender not rubbery we also ordered some french fries which were large but tasty hunks of fried potato to wash it down i got my grandfathers favorite dr browns celray soda that is a celery flavored soda no its not gross if you cant deal with that go for the cream sodai recommend bringing your own defibrillator in case someone is using the one provided

im not an ice cream person and ive been here three times in the space of one week twice i was in the area and once i went several blocks out of my way now that the initial week has passed ive been here once more you know for researchthe first time i went i noticed the place because there was a big crowd inside and i read a small sign on the door that said we now have pumpkin ice cream the texture was perfect and it was rich and delicious before finishing my cone i was already planning on coming back the next dayi know theres a lot of mixed reviews on here so i wanted to try a different flavor just to make sure it wasnt just the pumpkin that was so good so the other day i had the hazelnut that was good too my only concern is that they might not have their pumpkin ice cream this spring and summer since it wont be in season if that happens ill be blaming alice waters for my future grief

for my recent birthday two good friends took me to dinner and had made reservations at what we believed was going to be sambale turns out that sambale is no more and has been supplanted by a new restaurant called yerba buena meaning good herb one can only surmise what was behind that naming decision ha whereas sambale was apparently some mix of italian and brazilian yerba buena lands solidly in the latin american category with a cuban influencedespite walking in and being slightly mystified we were soon pleasantly surprised by all aspects of this new restaurant which according to our super accommodating maitred giovanni has only been open a weekmy friend and i sat at the bar waiting for our third dinner companion and partook of some extremely tasty not to mention enthusiastically crafted mojitos upon learning that we were celebrating my birthday giovanni informed us that he was going to make sure we had an extremely special evening and indeed it was when our remaining companion arrived and we were seated giovanni brought out a bottle of kava for us to share on the housethe service overall was superior it was attentive but unobtrusive sophisticated but friendly and unhurried our glasses were never low for more than seconds before they were being refilled for appetizers we had a red snapper ceviche which was prepared with lime and cilantro and prawns that were topped with chopped sauteed garlic and seasoning both were excellent the ceviche flavorful and tangy and the prawns tender and juicyfor the main course two of us had the ropa vieja which means old clothes which is a shredded preparation of beef with patacones which are fried plantains the meat was succulent and juicy and prepared just right and the plantains were crispy warm and delicious my other companion had the roasted suckling pig which also came shredded also with plantains and mojo which was good since this friend said he had been trying to get his mojo back for quite awhile the taste i had of the pork was delicious as well and id go back just to have that next time but both dishes were quite delicious and satisfyingthe evening was capped off with desert and a preliminary port tasting consisting of fonseca bin a dow i cant remember the variety of and one other that was fairly sweet the name of which also escapes me we chose the dow and decided to split the churros dessert which came drizzled with caramel vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce for dipping they were absolutely fantastico it was delivered with a candle and a song which made it even more special giovanni also generously delivered two more desserts on the house one of which was a very subtly sweet rice pudding that was definitely noteworthyprices are not super cheap with main courses in the midtwenties but i would say that for the quality of the food and service it was really quite a bargain the atmosphere and decor are sophisticated but festive and they play a mixture of latin and that lounge music that seems inescapable in new york city i happen to like it so for me it was all goodi would highly recommend yerba buena and i would also highly recommend giovanni as a maitred hes very knowledgeable and has just the right touch with overseeing service dinner was a fabulous experience from start to finish

the best beignets this side of the french quarter of course the other side of the french quarter is either the mississippi river or lake pontchartrain a huge portion of those precious beauties dusted with powdered sugar and served with three little ramekins filled with maple ice cream caramel and sticky mango marmalade for dipping it made me forget whether or not i liked the main course or how many zillions of calories i was consuming i did offer to share so it wasnt all my fault

so the day i decide to bust out my white sundress the sky opens up and it rains cats and dogs my umbrella was a sham as my friend and i ran into the crooked tree i noticed i was wearing a red bra and undies and so did everyone else but this nice gentleman that works there whose name unfortunately escapes me right now lent me his dry tshirt to cover my bits and on to the food and drinksthe sangria hit the spot and made me feel tingly in all the right places maybe they could tweak their recipe some to make it a wee bit stronger but for a cafe it was pretty good the crepes are delicious and just thinking about them now makes me feel all tingly again i think i may have to go back real soon either that or attempt to make them myself uh oh
ive died and gone back home this truly is the only real english establishment in all of nyc the complaints of other yelpers only proves this fact more and in essence also proves why this place is we english love to queue its one of our more beloved national pasttimes we queue for anything really we feel more comfortable in a queue asking us to queue for a spot of tea is not unheard of not even in bad weather wed queue up outside regardless even if the establishment had a capacity of since this is an english run business youre pretty much expected to were not exactly known for our native cuisine are we lets face it most of our native food is bland and canned serving tinned heinz beans on toast is exactly what were craving since its almost always more expensive to get authentic tinned heinz baked beans in bodegas and shops its well worth the much cheaper side dish at were also not exactly known for our politeness are we ive never heard of an american tourist coming to our country and remarking on how wonderfully nice we are its quite the opposite innitin addition to the above the food is fresh and delicious and as i mentioned authentic real unpresliced bread real thick cream cheese not the processed spreads hearty and strong teas my favourite is the vanilla mint its aroma can clear even the toughest of sinuses good for year round as it can surpress summer allergies and winter colds alike too hot out get it iced and to go the place is tiny so do expect to queue and get moved about even after being seated but please remain calm and refrain from bickering with your fellow patrons youre going to have to sit pretty close to them for the duration of your meal i dont know about you but i cant enjoy my tea with someone looking to start a row behind me turnover in the place on busy days is still pretty swift so be courteous mimic our stiff upper lip and let someone go before you youll be seated soon enough and without added aggravation
pho so mot is like a breath of fresh air in the lacking vietnamese options in the city it just happens to be tucked away in the back of mott street in a basement that often goes unnoticed that may be its one lacking fault as many restaurants have gone the way of the dinosaur here lucky or the dreaded so go even the cheapo hing long and hopefully this place will continue to thrivethe restaurant is small but quaint unlike the previous establishments pho so mot is clean and has created enough space for big groups with some actual round tables often times theyll have a flat screen tv playing vietnamese chinese programs drowning out most of the quiet ambiance on a whole the service is real decent and the owner is friendly like most other vietnamese restaurants the staff speaks both chinese and vietnamesethe food is most definitely quality and there is plenty of variety on the menu i am impressed with their bun dac biet and especially their pho the broth was fresh as it was tasty and the noodles were just perfect another dish that look extra impressive was the com tam suon bi cha which was presented quite well prices are also very good as most of the items are and below there is so much more here that i would like to try its practically a guarantee ill be back again and again right now theyre holding a grand opening special in which everything is off i am sure that will be there till the end of the year at leastthey are definitely so mot in my book cam on pho so mot thank you pho so
this is my third review of the day some of you might be thinking whoa easy chris j dont go blowing your load lucky for those select few that cant get enough of my writing ive taken viagra so even if the moment isnt right i can still write i had to review public double crown in the same day because theyre practically kissing cousins public has quite the cult following its well deserved this place succeeds where many others fail miserably it has the trendy vibe that make the young hip wealthy and overextended want to be seen there but it also backs it up with a relaxed environment to drink and very solid food options much like its kin double crown some designdecor thought clearly went into the space as evidenced by every detail down to the light fixtures my favorite part of this place is the marketing genius that is on display in the restroom they offer soap packaged with the public logo think about it as if it were a business card with soap brilliant you can guarantee i took two bars home with me the trout was very solid but fell short of gourmet what the restaurant lacks in cooking chops it makes up in vibe much like double crown the service is spot on which only enhances the experience many of these trendy places have an attitude that screams indifference towards the customers but these people have been well trained to ensure that public isnt resting on its reputation but that everyone is working to raise the bar again erica is great if you happen to go here based on this recommendation please tell her chris pizza j aka chelsea clintons boyfriend told you to say hello leave her a big tip too because everyone knows youre a baller and she deserves it so its been about six hours and the label said to contact my doctor if im experiencing an erection lasting more than hours please help
this is all you need to know about momofuku kofoie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts foie gras with riesling jelly lychee and pinenuts and deep fried short ribs probably the two most interesting textured dishes ive ever had in my life the taste was phenomenal as well but the use of texture was something on an entirely different level to anything youll find in new york right now momofuku ko is a unique dining experience with some massive hits and a few flavor combinations that had my head scratching but i would recommend anyone that has been discouraged by the reservation system to keep trying specifically on a sunday morning at exactly to easily reserve a saturday night spota few complaints the reservations system i know i know its been talked about to death but it was seriously annoying checking for reservations every day for weeks hopefully as everyone eats there it will become easier and easier to get a for a restaurant that is all about the chefs momofukus chefs are uncomfortably aloof to the diners working there seems to be like a chef vacation where every dish takes about seconds to prepare and you only do about covers a night most of the time i was there the chefs were standing around bored and it was painful to try to get them to converse with you im not saying it should take immense amount of work to put together a dish with fire flying around the kitchen it just seems like the menu at ko hasnt changed in weeks and mise en place arranged on the plate is almost the entire david chang wasnt thereim not a fanboy but when youre dropping per person to sit at a bar on a saturday night you dont want to see the string chefs again nothing against the very talented chefs that cooked for us but i was a bit disappointed yes i expect him to be at all of his restaurants cooking at the exact same time

yes yes oh my god one hundred thousand times yesnever mind the fact that this bakery and its lovably curmudgeony proprietor are within spitting distance of my apartment id trek to the ends of the earth or even worse the outer boroughs jk to consume claudes confectionspalmiers are probably my favorite pastry seriously those little light and crispy butterflies have me singing the reading rainbow song ten times over you know which one im talking about and when youve had claudes palmiers you too will be flying twice as high as the butterflies in the sky i have a friend who after having two of claudes mini palmiers said i think thats the best example of that type of pastry ive ever hadwhile the atmosphere is really nothing to write home about with its sparse tables fluorescent lighting and lack of decor this bakery would not look out of place if it were plucked out of the west village and landed smack in the middle of chinatown the lovingly crafted pastries and baked goods are worlds away from the assembly line items which we nowadays so often encounteri think claude likes me maybe just a little or maybe i am just stuck in giddy postpalmier delusions but when i went in for the second time in two days he greeted me with a sideways smile and a what can i get you my dear with a little jovial lift of his eyebrows maybe he likes me maybe just a little oh deari think i have a new crushupdate claude has been calling me sweetie and last night he gave me a white chocolate mousse tart swoons
a famous burger joint a stones throw from my apartment why did it take me two years to eat at melons who am i i will need to be in therapy for years to sort out this mystery well okay for real theres always a line and when youre in the mood for a burger youre not in the mood to wait screw that but my friends wanted burgers i never turn them down and we only had to wait about minutes at about on a friday night the burger itself was pretty delicious just like everyone said hot juicy perfectly medium rare and covered in cheese raw onions and pickles i added on some tomato and mustard and went to town oh yeah i was an animal parents had to cover their childrens eyes oh and the cottage fries i dig it i get bored with the same old fry and a cottage fry is a nice change that stands up well to salt and ketchup actionafter all that the big ass slice of chocolate chip cake was the icing on the onionbreath cake it was just the caloric kick i needed to sayhey im lindsay its almost may but you know what fuck swimsuit season later i will stare at my thighs in the mirror and cry but for now i will have my hamburger fries and cake and eat them too bitches
i once had a frankish girlfriend who combined a kind of global culinary elitism with the appetite of a gallic raiding party she has a kindred spirit in the menu and attitude of the new french which offers a mash up of far flung flavors curry and pho mussels and fries panroasted skate and coconut milk the atmosphere is also wonderfully dichotomous dark wood and candle light only momentarily obscure the childlike wall mural and trashy pop music the hot server had intelligent recommendations stunning eyes a cracked rib and seemed to have recently been in a street fight with switchblades a jovial gentlemen i took for an owner played dj and poured my table several glasses of wine on the house his reason i like you guysits a rare thing to be treated like an old friend at a restaurant youve never set foot in it helps to be accompanied by two smart gorgeous girls but the quantity of free wine and desserts on the house when we couldnt decide between them was excessively gracious further the overall highquality staff forces my hand star addedthe pizza biancas great for a menage a trois shared starter with a vegetarian present though i prefer my fingerlings left whole the skate was very good nicoise salad was perfect the tuna moist and abundant the mussels and fries are addictive warning there are aphrodisiacs in the chocolate cake and those caramelized bananas

if my funds were not so lacking i truly believe that i could spend a majority of my evenings here at jazz standardyou walk in through a rather sketch door next to the restaurant entrance and down an unassuming set of stairs to the jazz club even without reservations my parents and i were able to snag some seats in the sexy drapedinred space however said space was extremely crampeddespite this the unbelievable acoustics and even more unbelievably talented performers were enough to make me forget that half of my ass cheek was hanging off my seat

the strap on my dress broke when i was getting out of the cab in front of le bernardin fanfriggintastic so there i was meekly asking the maitre d if she had a safety pin while we were being shown to our table iz eet for your dress she whispered no i ordinarily stand with my hand twisted behind my back like houdini yes i said two minutes later the maitre d handed me a needle and light green thread the exact color of my dress needles sic to say le bernardin had me at hello the chefs tasting menu with wine pairings is the most delicious of any in nyc the seafood is perfect and enhanced by rare wines i will never forget after explaining the vintage of our first glass the sommelier smiled and asked how did that needle and thread work out nuf saidhaving the utmost respect for yelpers i read the reviews of le bernardin before i came one review pointed out that the pour was more generous for men than women so i was looking out for it the glasses poured by the sommelier were perfectly even almost artfully so but midway through the meal he got busy and his understudy did the pouring alas a noticeable difference i winked at my guy and slid my glass over to his to point this out by the time i had slid my glass back into place in front of me the first sommelier was at our table pouring both of us more wine without a word he disappeared he was ours again we didnt see the understudy for the rest of the night be still my heartoh and ripert was in the dining room hes very attractive dont tell my guy i said so unbelievable food impeccable service le bernardin is my new favorite splurge make it yours too but be careful getting out of the cab
ok where do i start first of all if youre going to enjoy this place youve got to be in a certain mindset dont go expecting to be king of the world because youre not the rice is dont go expecting to fill yourself up depending on your budget and how you order you very well might leave hungry but thats ok because youre gonna have a great time and whats wrong with a little ramen after dinner anyway basically go in there the first time with the mindset that youre going to a very seriousfine dining sort of place because thats what it is afterwards you can decide that its the kind of place youll want to make your regular sushi place but wont be able to afford to expect to be humbledok so here are some pointers for first make a reservation to sit at the sushi bar at the very least and sit in front of the man mr yasuda if your datetime is flexible the core of the place is in front of mr yasuda and at the sushi bar in general thats what youre coming for more on mr yasuda later its easy to be intimidated but dont worry about it ordering at the beginning was the hardest part but even if you make a misstep its ok mr yasuda will forgive you ive read so many different things about how to order and costs and everything i thought i had it figured out no i didnt but its really simple for the first time take it piecemeal get the basic set to start which is like less than and has nigiri and a half tunaroll which my friend said was the best tekkamaki he ever had i agree this is what hell suggest just to get the ball rolling hell ask you what you dont eat tell him then hell give you the nigiri one by one it will be awesome dont bother with soy sauce or anything else for that matter hes already seasoned it for you pay attention to the rice remember what i said about you not being king of the world youre not it but youll start to feel like it as the meal goes on after the set is over start looking at the list the waiters gave you at the beginning with suggestions for that day marked in red start thinking of what looks good to you then have the chef choose or more nigiri for you thats what omakase means you decide its not a prefixe menu its whatever the chef thinks is good and thinks that youll like the sushi experience is all about the interaction between you and the sushi chef and about you trusting him to make you happy one of two things will happen either hell pick what you were looking at in which case youll be amazed at his mindreading abilities this happened to us or hell pick something totally different either way its going to be good even if you dont think you like sea urchin roe if he utters the word uni you say yes please same goes for at this point its up to you you can ask for suggestions you can ask him for specific things you can ask him to choose whatever at this point you can keep going until it feels right to stop youll be having a grandold time with the chef at this point so hell know what you like but if something catches your eye dont be afraid to ask for it a cool thing about the list thats in front of you youll always know how much each piece is so you can keep an eye on your budget the most expensive pieces are the different kinds of toro obviously at each rolls are a little more expensive but youre not gonna go and have of those at a time uni and other pieces are around about mr yasuda hes a character very nice but can be a little intimidating at first dont worry about it hes a talker hell talk a ton about his whole style about rice about where the fish comes from about what sucks about most japanese restaurants and why hes doing what hes doing as my friend said hes a man on a mission to make his way of sushi the standard way of sushi according to him his way isnt special just the way its supposed to be sometimes it can be hard to understand every word but just smile and nod and itll be fine oh and another thing hes a smartass seriously he spent a good amount of time during the course of the meal busting my balls but it was all in good fun i wouldnt recommend this place for a date for a few reasons first of all the focus isnt on the two of you its on the food the chef and you and the interaction among them secondly theres the budget thing any urge to impress can lead to a skyrocketing bill and even more if you have appetizers or drinks ok thats all yelp will let me write if you love sushi the way it was meant to be and are prepared to humble yourself sushi yasuda is the way to go
soooo im thinking about writing a book about my dining experience at per se it will be titled ways to describe persefection i was truly blown away i found myself complimenting every single aspect of my meal therethe food the service the ambiance the presentation and the little things they do to make you feel special everything was absolutely perfect calling the food delicious felt like an understatement nice would have been such a plain description mcdonalds can be described as nice and to call per se the same would just be downright offensive to describe the food with such mediocre terms i would be a disgrace to fellow foodies the world overso back to the book itll be formatted with one word per page it will and should be brought to per se for a meal as every course is brought out the readerdiner will open the book to a random page and the word will accurately describe their dish think like the book of answers except adjectives to describe your experienceso far there are words perfect execellent phenomenal astounding amazing awesome divine incredible outstanding terrific fantastic wonderful fabulous superb heavenly of course therell be slang words tight legit money legal ill shiznit ie this salmon with creme fraiche amuse bouche is the shiznitim still taking submissions for words after all the words therell be mini chapters such if you ask nicely they will give it to you to describe the service and how much they go out of their way to please you ie asking for a second helping of amuse bouches and a second round of if you tell them that youre there for a special occasion they print personalized menus for you and your dining party another important chapter will be dedicated to the difference between spring and fall flavors with the fall flavors being all about truffles risotto heavier sauces and meats and the spring being lighter with a lot of fish and poultry though of course this definitely could change as per ses menu changes daily to be covered in the chapter called its different every timei havent yet decided if therell be a section for medicore words like nice delicious and good i might put it in for the people that were unimpressed by the food if this chapter will be in my book though itll be all the way in the back as the spotlight of the book is how truly amazing per se is all book proceeds will go to my per se dining fundthank you
one day walking down the street with my wife i saw a flash of light i was struck confused for a moment everything waswashed out very white all i could make out was a sign that said yonah schimmels knishes bakery and i understood that this was a glimpse of the afterlife or heaven i walked inside and purchased a knish needing to know that after all was said and done that there would still be good food whereever i end up i took bite after bite and slowly a tear started to fall down my cheek the god of potatoes had shown me potato perfection i looked up smiled and mouthed thank you after finishing the knish i sat on a bench catching my breath as the world slowly came back into focus i turned to to my wife and saidi have seen the light
i had been clothes shopping for hours on saturday with no success walking down broadway dejected my eye caught a familiar name i had no idea they opened a in new yorki love their chicago locations and ive ordered from them online before so i traipsed on in and decided to redo my entire apartment i was having this whirlwind of ideaseveryone was really friendly there was one cute sales guy who asked if i needed help but i didnt yet when i did i couldnt find him so i had to settle for someone else dont tell him he was my second choiceanyway this place is cheaper than crate and barrel and also a bit more trendy everything here is my style which you may not know based on my apartment which is square feet and furnished on an ikea budget meaning with stuff from ikea but thats all changingi pointed to stuff and said i want one of those and three of those and the little man would run in back and pile them behind the register for me i was on such a power trip and i think i was kinda condescending to him but it was part of my game i got shelves and a throw and christmas decorationsi also decided to redo my bathroom repaint a wall from red to orange and possibly trash my kitchen table so ill be coming back this weekendyou can do amazing things here on a budget plus home delivery in manhattan which i know is standard in new york furniture stores but its still a novelty to me as a native outlander
while my boyfriend can die in peace now that he has eaten at difaras i do not share his sentimentas i hope to live long enough to return to midwood for some moreafter eating a late lunch and packing emergency snacks in case we got hungry while waiting online there was no wait to speak of we walked in and ordered a half porcinimushroom cheese pie the next twenty minutes were spent watching mr demarco meticulously prepare our pizza from the initial sprinkling of the cheese to its final christening with olive oil now i have to admit that after eating my first piece i began to doubt di faras reputation having spent a week last year in italy eating pizza almost everyday for lunch as well as taking a local pilgrimage to grimaldis my pizza standards were pretty high it was definitely good but not the level of awesomeness i was expectingmeanwhile my boyfriend sat across the table in pure pizza ecstasy was my palate off were my standards unreasonable i reached for second piece and suddenly my doubt was erased and i joined my boyfriend in pizza heavenhow could two slices of the same pizza taste so vastly different in my eyes mr demarco is the jackson pollack of pizza some areas of his canvas get pools of olive oil some get a sprinkle some get an extra slice basil while others are left wanting more while i am firm believer that you can never have too much olive oil cheese or basil i would happily risk getting a fourstar slice at difaras if it is followed by a heavenly six star

over the years i have begun to see the value of specialization over wellroundedness take the case of levain the small downstairs bakery in a classic uws block you might say that levain has a wide range of products baguettes loaves of bread sandwiches and even pizzas and pastry products including brioches scones and muffins however they are best known for their specialization in cookies wellrounded almost hemispherical creations that are fashionably out of shape and inconsistent in their appearancethe cookies come in four flavors with the chocolate chip walnut likely being the most popular other flavors include dark chocolate chip and dark chocolate peanut butter i prefer the oatmeal raisin cookie this jumbo cookie is loaded with plump raisins and is crispy on the outside while being extremely soft in the center the dark chocolate ones have an overpowering taste of chocolate each cookie tips the scales at an impressive half a pound sic and is priced at can smell levains cookies from fifty feet away and if you are not sold on their aroma you will fall for their buttery richness a couple of cautionary notes make sure your cookie is fresh and not cold and remember not to expect any seating except a bench on the sidewalk right outside levain cookie monster a cookie monster b me on my most recent visit though two largesized individuals squeezed me out of the bench they must specialize in consuming levains creations but then they appeared to be quite wellrounded i left cookie in hand for central park
if i can think of one grievance against gramercy tavern it would be that throughout the dinner my date was fawning more over the restaurant than over me and despite my unwarranted large ego and jealousy to match a particular god of the old testament i have forgiven my date for such a grave offense because all jokes aside gramercy tavern not only matched our high expectations it exceeded them in its perfect execution and flawless delivery of all aspects of the dining experienceas with jean georges and nougatine gramercy tavern offers two dining experiences the tavern and the dining room each has its own space unique decor individualized menu and a different price tag closer to the entrance of the restaurant and encompassing the bar the tavern is the more casual side of the restaurant decorated with colorful contemporary paintings of fruits and vegetables the tavern is charmingly lively and fun although the date and i only stayed at the tavern for drinks i actually much more enjoyed the atmosphere here than in the dining roomthe cocktails that we had at the bar were absolutely superb i ordered the orange blossom sparkling wine elderflower orange bitters and the date got peach basil fizz bourbon peaches basil soda but ended up switching drinks with the date partly because i ended up enjoying his drink more and partly because i kept teasing him of how masculine he looked with a champagne flute for both drinks they were subtle and delicious the date also later got the tradewind rum cucumber ginger lime which was spicy and refreshingwith dimmer lights and a quieter crowd the dining room is the elegant and intimate counterweight to the lively and casual tavern the charming grace of the dining room is derived from its subtlety unlike the other famed colonial themed restaurant one if by land two if by sea gramercy tavern doesnt capitalize on the antique decorations to a point of garishness rather the restaurant decor is a tasteful balance of modern and colonial that serves as a visual representation of the restaurants culinary philosophysimply stated the dinner was absolutely amazingsince both the date and i preferred the larger selection of options form the dinner menu than the tasting menus we ended up getting the dinner menus rather than the season tasting menu or the vegetarian tasting menu for the first course i ordered the veal cappelletti and the date ordered the black tagliatelle for the main course i ordered the smoked lobster while my companion got the rack of pork and braised bellywith all the dishes i was floored by how meticulously thought out and exquisitely prepared everything was though gracefully subtle the flavors were by no means lacking each ingredient played off another so well to bring out the most in its flavor and texture as for my veal cappelletti the veal was so tender id describe it as being soft as velvet the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was light and really brought out the flavors of the veal the lobster entree was without any competition the best lobster ive ever had tack on any appetizing adjective applicable to a crustacean dish because the lobster here really was perfectand the desserts swoon i ordered the grand marnier mascarpone cheesecake gentlemen lets get serious mascarpone cheesecake is a fail proof dessert on its own but if you add grand marnier into the mix the end result is what id call if i may be so lewd the pantydropper of sweets learn to make it while my date got the chocolate bread pudding the cheesecake was phenomenal soft sweet flavorful and i really loved the brittle with which it came crispy crunchy lasting caramelized sugar taste that reminds me of the white grandmother i imagined having the only thing not orgasmic was the lemonraspberry sorbet which was just fine ive never been a big fan of bread pudding so i didnt steal my dates food as ive been shamelessly doing all night all in the name of research i swear but the ice cream that came along was absolutely divinethroughout the night the service was impeccable the servers were not only polite knowledgeable helpful but they were also very well versed in the art of short polite conversations armed with rapid witof course not everything was perfect the upholstery looks like those of a dentist from the and i also found an eyelash in my dessert but since i did get another dish with apologies and since the ordeal was handled with commendable courtesy i cant find much else to complain gramercy tavern absolutely deliveredand seriously speaking i cant be mad at my date i mean shoot im fawning more over gramercy tavern than over him hell im so in love with this place if i ever make those silly people im allowed to sleep with list im adding gramercy tavern onto the it right after eric bana

updatemei lai wah coffee shop will reopen in two days as mei lai wah bakery lai wah was closed in april but im so thankful this wasnt like with the moon house to shanghai kitchen revival mei lai wah proves its hard to keep a good place closedend updateby far the best roasted char siu baos pork buns i ventured into this archaic little coffee house youve gotta love their cash register thats straight from the after reading about it in an article a few years back to try their famous roasted pork buns instant jackpot after my favorite dim sum char siu bao joint sun hop shing closed down i needed to find a new fix and boy did i dont bother with any other place for your roasted pork buns just go to mei lah wah and youll save yourself a lot of time and energyat cents apiece you can bring home a dozen for though the pork buns themselves arent large the pork pieces are not shredded i hate those and are nice fatty with a tasty sauce the only complaint if there is one is that the sugar glaze they paint on top can leave your hands stickyi havent tried out their regular fare but just solely based on the pork buns this place is a the old grandpas who run this timewarped coffee house are interesting characters also the filipinos who grocery shop in chinatown all seem to know of mei lai wahs pork buns so if you arrive after them be prepared to wait for the next batch to be cooked because these filipino families buy them in mass quantities i figure they throw them in the freezer at home or else how can you eat that many
dos xxs on tap amber or laggeryou know i have to say i only had one item on the menu and a beer but the sopes were suuuper tasty and the rest of the menu looked just as good if im in the neighborhood again i would definitely come back there was a live band in the corner and a larger back room unfortunately the back room isnt as cozy as the front of the house and you couldnt really hear the live bands music from back there that would be nice but then again thats just logistics very cute cozy little neighborhood place that made me want to move well donedate rating up scale couples at the bar definitely not a singles scenestrong suggestions bring some friends and share you will certainly have a hard time just trying to choose one item on the menu are so many people
this is the closest star classier restaurant near me and i must say i am very pleased by its addition to the somewhat sleazy few blocks i reside within id actually give this place stars but im rounding up for nearly uniformly amazing quality of food perfect service and a fabulous wine list the only flaws are prices this place isnt cheap and the portions are on the small side though still satisfying sized and the bread european white crusty rolls and olive focacciastyle twisty bread that is served is at best mediocre they also do not have a hard liquor licensefortunately the large but not overwhelming and very excellent wine list makes up for the lack of other booze and they do offer prosecco and sake based cocktails and a few types of sangria my lovely dining partner rebecca h got the apricot mint sparkling cocktail and it was tasty and fresh i opted for wine and their two roses by the glass each a grenache from france a merlot from spain both sounded so appealing and the erudite sommelier and i got into quite a discussion about roses he offered to give me a half glass of each for the price of one glass and they were generous pours the grenache was palest pink light strawberries and a hint of sparkle and good minerality very crisp the merlot was deeply coloured almost red rich ripely fruity and also vaguely sparkling both were the best roses ive had in at least a year but the merlot in particular blew my mind and we ended up getting a bottle of itmeanwhile i munched on the crusty but not particularly flavourful white roll and the flavourful but dry and rather stale olive bread which at least gained some points when dipped into the dish of delightfully green and fruity extra virgin olive oil i considered consuming the evoo straight in fact but refrained for reasons of dignityrebecca and i split an appetiser of the heirloom tomato crostini which thoroughly impressed us both and arrived swiftly mediumsized for an app large wedges of firm but ripe yellowgreen heirloom tomatoes and halved almost candysweet red cherry tomatoes topped and cascaded over a long rectangle of oliveoil drenched crisped white bread a light pestoolive oil sauce brought all the flavours and textures together in perfect harmony i only wish there had been more than tiny leaves of rocketnext came rebeccas marinated hanger steak which was cooked just as requested mediumrare nicely pink tender and flavourful with a chimichurri sauce our server claimed contained cilantro but which i can gratefully vouch did not it was pure lemonyherbal goodness i did not try the sauteed chard which appeared fresh and gently cooked or the fingerling potatoes with cheesy topping which looked scrumptious but were rather underrepresented but the speed which with rebecca devoured these sides convinced me they must have been damn goodmy own spice crusted lamb was excellent two thick rib chops which doesnt sound like much but these were hefty and free of gristle and quite lean again perfectly cooked to a juicy medium rare and nicely seasoned with cumin and other middle eastern spices ive never had anything quite like the fried hummus side a decentsized round of dense moist but with a delicately fried slightly crunchy exterior but it reminded me of fried polenta and it complemented the lamb wellthe sweet and tangy fruit sauce berries apricots was just enough to balance the flavours of the lamb and hummus much as the flavours were so lightly yet fully harmonised in the steak dish my one peeve was that the fairly generous portion of sugar snap peas were not snap peas but instead some very fine green beans almost haricots verts sauteed in oil till green and crisp i enjoyed them but on principle i dislike substitution without forewarningamazingly i was quite satisfied by the food thus my belief that the portions though not americansized were not exactly bird food either still i badly wanted to try the goat cheesecake with lavender honey and rebecca decided to go for a sweet riesling as a dessert wine her wine was delicious fruity and sweet but still crisp not cloying my surprisingly large dessert was good but not amazing i honestly couldnt taste the goat cheese and the sauce was not lavender honey but instead a sort of wild blueberry and honey compote which was tasty but again not what it said on the menu and the lack of goat flavour distressed me greatlythe interior is lovely and sleek and modern and the service was fast attentive but not pushy courteous and friendly i liked that there was more light than in so many dimlylit ny restaurants but not so much that it was glaring our total came to nearly including tip which is not cheap but my experience was fabulous enough to just barely warrant it at least oncebeer wine only they take reservations and seat promptly
my friends brought me here for my birthday last month they told me to tell the bartender that it was my birthday she asked for my id to verify then she draw something on the back of my hand after that she told me that i could drink anything except for patron for free for the rest of the nighti was like a kid in a candy store i was chugging down shots of everything every minutes ive never been more drunk in my whole lifewhen it was time to go home my friends took a cab and said goodbye i asked the bartender where the nearest subway is and she told me that she would drop me off because she was on her way home anyway talk about great service

i have never bought or owned louboutin shoes so my review is completely without credibility stop reading nowbut sufferin sweet succotash this store is amazing i hate when stores use the little buzzer at the door before they let people in it makes me feel so inferior and pedestrian but honestly i got over that the moment i stepped in i was immediately swathed in a cocoon of footwear disguised as art there is no doubt that this store is magical the air smells of babies and fresh rain any food you eat here is calories the sales people are all attractive and friendly and all the shoes are your size and dollars ok well not so much but a girl can hope right to be honest im not sure i will ever be able to justify buying a pair of these shoes because of their completely unapologetic frivolity and my calendar currently has no redcarpet events scheduled in it but i will always admire them all women can appreciate a beautiful shoe and there is no doubt that christian louboutin makes them superlatively so this store displays them justly as walletbusting heeled redsoled stars
cognitive dissonanceaccording to britannicacom this psychological phenomenon is the mental conflict that occurs when beliefs or assumptions are contradicted by new informationi had spent several weeks eagerly clicking the momofuku website at to login to try to score a reservation they say this place is harder to book than per se david chang is being lauded as the best new chef this side of hester blumenthal or ferran adria ok im exaggerating but only a little surely this means i could not give ko anything less than five stars could i well i copped out and gave it five stars but it was closeothers have already described the decor so no need to belabor that i went with a female friend and as others have also mentioned we were served different things on a least a few courses we noticed that there were two other pairs eating at the same time and the man received the same dishes i did while the woman received the same food as my friend however the last group consisted of two girls and one of them was served the same food i was so i dont think its completely by gender i think they do try to give a group of people a variety in addition to the food you can pick from a or drink tasting menu i was going to go for the but my friend talked me into splitting the asking me when do you think youll come nexti thought the first of the meal was underwhelming the biggest disappointments spiced chicharron aka pork rind after hearing so much about this i was sorely disappointed the rind was too subtle read bland i honestly would rather have eaten pork rinds from a bag or as my friend put it good ol chinese style shrimp chips are betterkim chee consomme with pork belly and raw oyster the consomme is a latterday version of kimchee chigae and i have to say this was the most disappointing dish because i had looked forward to it the most neither the broth nor the pork had much flavor and the oysters were not enough to save the day other dishes that were bland were the chawan mushi with asparagus pea soup with crawfish and halibut so how the heck can i justify giving them five stars because of the last dishesthe shaved foie gras torchon you know when you eat flavored shaved ice desserts such as those at vietnamese or korean restaurants when you put a spoonful in your mouth all the shaved ice melts together into once mass and then you taste the intense sweetness of the azuki bean or condensed milk this is the same except better you put a big bite of shaved foie gras in your mouth just experiencing the powdery texture but not the taste yet then it all starts melting together and you get this taste explosion in your mouth combine that with the lychee and the pinenuts foie gras in general is great when you contrast the rich flavor with the sweetness of fruit and the bitterness of nuts and david chang nailed this combination wow deep fried short ribs tender and moist on the inside yet crispy on the outside and flavorful throughout that says it allfried apple pie with sour ice cream and miso paste this felt like it came straight out of the wylie dufresnesam mason school of dessertmaking great crispy apple pie with just enough sweetness and tartness combined with some ice cream and some intense pastecereal milk panna cotta brings you back to your childhood it tastes like a fantastic bowl of corn flakes in milk on those days when you poured the perfect amount of flakes from the box and added just the right amount of milk and the cereal has been soaking in the milk long enough to impart its flavor but not long enough to melt into the milkalso the pasta with mascarpone and snails that janelle mentioned was pretty good and so was the hens egg with caviar and potato chips though i have to say many others are doing pretty good things with eggs these days of course my review of each dish is a bit irrelevant because if you go youll eat exactly what they feed you and like it so should you slavishly mark out every day to sit at your computer to try to book a res here the answer is yes because some of the dishes served were transcendent however i will say that i have had recent meals at latelier adour and dovetail to name a few that were consistently better throughout all the courses so sure if it takes a few seconds of your time try to score a res but if you dont get one dont worry about it and go eat at some of the restaurants above and others that are just as good or better and wont cause you as much stress to book

le bernardin deserves its gazillionpoint zagat rating for many reasons but im giving it stars here for one highlight of my dining experience i was pleasantly surprised to find that each stall in the womens bathroom was stocked with feminine hygiene products in a city that thinks that chicks will steal tampons with the same zeal with which they apparently steal toilet paper le bernardin is a pioneer in the field of womens rightsthe food wasnt bad either tuna tartare spicy black bass chocolate corn served three ways each dish was beautifully prepared and fantastically plated my dining partner had a monkfish entree with truffle sauce that was to die for i seriously considered stabbing him in the neck with one of my many silverware options and comandeering his meal fortunately for him le bernardins decor has a soothing effect and by the time i was midway through my entree i was too satisfied to do anything but bask in the glory that is this restauranti see that the service has recieved mixed reviews but my experience with the many servers with whom we interacted was nothing but superior we got this great table in the back of the restaurant where we could scope out the other diners all of whom looked like big wigs in their respective industries but the servers still treated us like vips even though we were obviously young and possibly disfiguredle bernardin is a great restaurant with a great location and great food is it the best of the best thats for you to decide but on this one i agree with zagat
i have this problem in life that i would like to discuss with youits rather personal so if youd please not tell anyone id appreciate it its rather embarassingok its hard for me to get this out in the open so bare with me i deep breathei tend to over eatthere i said my god it feels good to get that off my chest when im surrounded by good food i cant say no and i end up shoveling it into my mouth and i literally mean i shove it into my mouth i carry a small shovel with me where ever i go it helps with food and also to helps me dig myself into holes which im known to doanyways my girlfriend desired fondue so i took her to swizz i heard good things about the restaurant and we heard that they had a large pile of cheese related things on the menu i wore some tight pants hoping that if i keep my stomach from expanding i wont overeat in case the food was good obviously im deluding myself because my stomach can lift trucks if it wants we arrived late for our reservation but it wasnt a problem stupid subway the host sat us down in the small narrow restaurant the walls are brick and are adorned with photographs from a local artist and there is a beautiful wall display of wine we ordered the traditional fondue for two and a ceasar salad the salad was delicious presented very artfully and prettily that isnt a real word but i like it the fondue was then presented in a large bowl there was a mountain of cheese in the bowl the bread was firm delicious and perfect for dipping there was so much cheese in the bowl i contemplated taking a bath in it but im not sure id want cheese stuck in my pores though maybe i do i could start a cheeseinpore cosmetic trend id become famous have commericals ads sponsor my own cheese girls and get free season tickets for the green bay packers and i dont even like the packers hmm well screw that then ill hold out for the broncosthe great thing about the food at swizz is that besides being a large helping the food is so good that you dont feel like there is a brick in your stomach when you leave you just feel full and great and like you need to take a nap cheese fueled naps are one of the few great joys of life
specializes in pigs feeti would definitely call myself an adventurous eater i enjoy chicken feet intestines tripe kidneys hearts if it is cooked right but i really wasnt sure about a place that had pigs feet in every dish on their menupigs feet done all different ways marinated in miso simply salted and grilled sake infused etc but what really shocked me was that they did not just make the tonsoku japanese for pigs feet japanese style they also made tonsoku ratatouille and in pasta italian style tonsoku cabanara and a few otherswe ordered about different dishes the best was the tonsoku hot pot they bring a hot pot similar to shabu shabu or sukiyaki with the ingredients and sauce already in the pot the sauce looked gelatinous like runny jello after it heats for about mins the gelatinous goop becomes thick soup the dish was deep rich and savory with nice dark marinated pigs feet and flavorsoaked vegetables the shitake was extremely flavorful another excellent choice was the simply salted grilled tonsoku nothing complex just salted with sea salt and grilled so tasty and brought out the uncompromised taste of the pork i also enjoyed the oreilles du cochon pigs ear marinated in vinegar soy fun texture in a cold vinegar dressing nice start the desserts did not stand out although i did enjoy the rare cheesecake after the meal it was in the texture of thick whip but had a sweet tastei would definitely return next time id love to try the rice bibimbop using the hot pot sauce after the hot pot dish which leaves a nice thick savory sauce in the hot to cook with and the deep fried tonsoku kara age i give hakata tonton stars for a tasty inventive meal and an extra star for the interesting rest room amenities lip my panties the nice wait staff and the pez at the end of the meal

when i was a kid i had a weekend ritual with my friend shlomo on a saturday afternoon i would journey out to his house in flatbush on the d train at the time all the way from bedford park blvd in the bronx its a long ride at some point around dinner time he and i would depart his parents house and head to avenue j and get falafel sandwiches take our sandwiches over to midwood high school stadium and sit behind the bleachers in the aisle and chow then wed smoke our really bad nickel bag of weed and head over to watch rocky horror picture show at the graham theater stoned out of our gizzards ah thems were the daysunbeknownst to me i was walking right past pizza greatness over and over at that time good ny pizza was less of a rare find than it is today back then even the average joe slice as i like to refer to it a slice you could get at any local pizza joint was decent no such luck today rays pizza the real orginal one on st and avenue pretty much sucks ass and disappoints on every level and most places just cook a million pies with a zillion ingredients and leave them splayed out behind glass for you to choose from their overly cheesed overloaded offerings yech i see those places and i walk right byas has been previously noted this guy has craft the pizza is freakin delicious in my view you can absolutely not take stars off for the wait if you go here you know youre waiting its part of the experience theres plenty to read on the walls with reviews and accolades taking up most of the available space there was even a group of folks that made an evening out of it by bringing two bottles of wine and staking out two tables at the back where they were patiently waiting for their pizza be prepared to wait take the experience in and enjoy theres so much going on in this place that its hard to be boredyou do have to keep an eye on things because dom is not the most organized fella pizza maker extraordinaire absolutely man with a system definitely but making pizzas in order is not his forte one of my favorite moments came after wed been waiting almost an hour and had watched people that had ordered after us pick up their pies and leave doms daughter was there helping out this particular evening taking orders bringing him dough for new pies and extra ingredients for the orders that called for them at one point shed brought a tray of ingredients that were clearly ours and put them on the pizza table for him to use on our pizza half sausage half pepperoni all onion which sat there for about minutes untouched the exchange went as followsdoms daughter im really sorry i dont know what hes doingme what do you mean if you dont know what hes doing we definitely dontdoms daughter he keeps making plain regular pies and forgetting to put the extra ingredients on themshe shook her head and went in back soon enough dom grabbed the tray of ingredients and put them on our future pizzathe pizza when it finally arrived one hour and twenty minutes after wed walked in was spiritual unfortunately my half of it i eat kind of fast was consumed within about minutes of arrival the crust is sublime the sauce delicious and the confluence of cheeses all melted together is unparalleleda few of observations some new some its absolutely retarded to point out the decor or the cleanliness of this restaurant if you want sterile steel counter pizza go elsewhere this place hasnt changed in years and its good just like it i loved that on the menu above the pizza table and the old cash register that sits apparently unused and broken with the drawer wide open it sayspizza slicesregular or square right underneath thatreguler or square toppingsyou cant buy that kind of cool reguler its proof that darwinism has gone horribly awry with regard to humans this has been pointed out but i have to repeat it because its so unrealpeople actually do show up to this place for slices in case you didnt notice the prices for slices are clearly designed to dissuade you from ordering them in my view you need to be relieved of your privileges as a human if you do this the idea that you would show up for a slice is completely unfathomable if you are reading this and have done it please pretty please find a painless way of taking your own life soon this is clearly just one of the more minor manifestations of your abject stupidity and you need shuffle off this mortal coil before you hurt someone with actual brains by accident im serious help the human race off yourselfjust sayingo eat di fara while this guy is still cranking out pies its more than worth the trip

the starting point of abstinence is often an inherent belief that what gives pleasure eventually causes pain before legions of yelpers fresh from lurking or working the talk threads mistake my reference to things dirty i should clarify that i only have such indulgences in mind as pastries cheese and perhaps wellpaying jobs on wall street while i might be correct in linking abstinence to a preemptive strike from a strong mind i am likely wrong in assuming that legions of yelpers bother to read my reviewslarte is an indulgence you could abstain from their gelato and avoid the pain of working out but here are some reasons you shouldnt the menu comprises two dozen choices of gelato and sorbet they encourage free sampling as many as youd like to try the service is friendly even if dispassionate on occasion even when the lines are long they move quickly the gelato is smooth in texture and the ingredients seem fresh larte is understated cool more so than grom capogiro in philadelphia is not a practical option the gelato is topped off with a spoon of a random flavor random pistachio tiramisu need i say more lartes wellpedigreed gelato comes at a premium price but for pistachio mascarpone tiramisu biscotti or stracciatella of this caliber i would all but give up my entire bank balance if only i lived in the west village i would constantly indulge in their party packs and gelato cakes and pay daily visits to load up on their cups and cones of gelato but then recent pictures of my increasingly spindleshaped physique suggest that it might finally be time to abstain
the experience of eating at alis kebab cafe is only trumped by the food my god the place is as wide as two picnic tables as long as four the first half of the establishment is alis kitchen you walk in and you will see amazing food sitting there waiting for you i knew i found love only a few seconds after entering the door people treat ali like he is one of the gods on easter island which he actually resembles there is a process by which the ordering takes place here as ali walks up to your table everyone quiets and pays attention he then speaks in a very deliberate egyptianaccented english describing the specials of the day we have fish we have meat we have vegetabitarianwhat is your pleasure for todayhis overpronunciation makes everything sound delicious he is like an opera singer of the kitchen even during the meal when he announces to other tables its nearly impossible not to turn your attention away this is a street show that repeats every minutes and i have to watch each one we were brought our food by the man himself as was the case for most of the roomthere is nothing he touches that doesnt turn to gold he reached in and took out the spine of my friends fish with his bare hands right on our table he could have fucking deboned it with his tongue and we would have still thought he was still charming as hell our food came out very fast considering the place was packed with other people not slow at all ive gone twice in days and each time the wait was perfectly normal suggestions if i have to any whole fish some shank of some sort and something youve never had before brains tonguecheek cows foot or mountain oystersservers recommendation i only was able to check the first one see you again ali
i was in the neighborhood for an appointment and decided to go to robuchon on a whim i had just finished a month diet with very little fat decadence and to my standards very little taste so knowing this was a star yelped establishment i thought ive got a couple of hours and im not hurting for cash right now so why notfirst off the four seasons hotel where robuchon is located is designed by im pei and is a sight in and of itself id say get here a bit early and check the place out a bit its worth your timelatelier is split into two kinds of seating the first is counterstyle seating right in front of beautiful open kitchen the is more traditional seating with generously spaced tables in the welldesigned space since i was dining on my own and was curious as to see what was going on in the kitchen i decided to opt for the counterand then i was presented with optionsso many good options the discovery menu the express menu with app main and a desert an a la carte menu with traditional entrees or should i order from the immensely creative and appetizing menu of small plates since i was following my whims today i decided for the tasting menu one small problem thougheggs freak me out i can have em baked in something or used to coat something thats fried up but the sight of egg in my meal makes me gag i guess im just strange but luckily the helpful and kind staff let me substitute the asparagus with soft egg dish with the one dish i was dying to try les burgers being a burger fiend and and eggophobe this was greatly appreciated so out came the amuse bouchea shot glass with a bottom layer of a mousse foie gras a small layer of port wine reduction and a top layer of a foam of parmesan in translation a shot glass full of fat and oh had i missed fat like the deserts miss the rain in fact eating made a little everything but the girl techno beat start in my head and my senses dance oh man was i ready for an experiencenext came a beautiful looking starter in an amazing little ovalbowl plate that was obviously designed with a lot of thought for a dish like this it was a layer of avocado followed by a layer of gazpacho and a layer of crab meat light cool and spot on it was the perfect summer starter right in the middle of springthis was followed by an absolutely drop dead gorgeous dish of scallops and sea urchin a very light and delicate plate and extremely tasty though i regretted not taking a picture of it since it was garnished so beautifully with a little bit of green and red next came what i believe was the real show stopper langoustine pappilout with basil pesto it was my first time having langoustine and man what a creative preparation again artful and light and this dish happened to be a perfect the crispy shell and basil sauce was the perfect foil to the langoustine i wanted more good thing more was comingwhen i thought that couldnt be topped next was the burger its a tiny little thing smaller than a slider it almost comes out looking like a toy but thats not a toy thats a little hunk of high quality beef topped with another hunk of foie gras and some bell peppers on brioche and that is greasy fatty perfection right there i realized that its so tiny because any bigger would cause a spontaneous heart attack it was accompanied by some perfect thin crinkle cut french fries and a ginger ketchup that has to be one of the best condiments ive had now that is an artists take on the burger and fries right thereafter that came a fish dish lamadai again something ive never had and it was explained to me that it was similar to bass but again simple but elegant it came served on a terrific citrus broth and a crispy topping garnished with some edible flowers much much better than i expected and the perfect transition between the burgers and my next dish kobe beefthe kobe beef the perfect dish of the day it was served with a little bit of onion topping a side of incredible buttery potato mousse super whipped mashed potatoes and a little salad ultimately simple but just a beautiful execution of what the french can do with beefdessert was more fun times first a predesert shot of raspberry and lychee a nice cool and refreshing introduction to the sweet part of menu than a little papplemousse grapefruit with a mint sorbet that was again served in a very unique dish you can tell there was some real artistic thought put into this and finally a little chocolate and coffee mousse that was the perfect ending to an outstanding mealthis was my first experience with a tasting menu and while it cost me a small fortune it was worth every penny an artists studio indeed every detail and every plate the work of a true artist sometimes the experience is just worth it

first off i have to admit i hate roller coasters the sensation of repeatedly being taken very high and dropped to a free fall at a sharp slope trajectory is stuff that nightmares are made of that said i do things just like you that scare the freakin bejesus out of me just because i mean what is life without a little ahhh fing hell in itbefore you get on this roller coaster divulge yourself of your bags and any belongings that will not comfortably fit in your pockets not your shirt pockets either unless they have a closure to keep the items in there is a handy bag check right before you get into your seatdo not bother to bring your camera on the ride the idea that you might actually be able to take a picture while on this creaky wooden death machine is absolute foolishness i brought my little camera and had to tuck it under my butt cheeks once the ride got going it was like having a doody hanging out in my drawers a discomfort that was only fleetingly experienced since most of my mind was busy screaming a death crymy third bit of advice is to not have eaten too much boardwalk fun food ice cream fried funnel cake fried seafood whatever and lots of beer make for discomfiting playmates when youre being twisted like a pretzel through the sky these swerves and drops are totally scary shit it feels like you are the dice in the hand of gd and hes working it hard for babys new pair of shoes the best thing to do is just zen on the first drop i learned that lesson i was so freaked out i was as tight as one of those rubber band balls you make when it gets really boring at the office well that first drop doesnt fall from a level placement it goes forward and then just a bit up and then straight down so that you actually lift upwards from your seat suspended in air as the car begins hurling earthbound at mach speed when you finally thankfully bottom out it is possible to slam the bottom of your chin on the rail bar fortunately the rail bar is padded do not be screaming with your tongue out of mouth as this could result in very serious injury its a blessing and a surprise that i didnt yak myselfit helps to have your friends next to you screaming bloody murder i had a sore throat from drinking and partying my way through germany for days and couldnt scream for myself my friends screeching was horrifically cathartic enough to effect an emotive release for me the crazy ride experience hearkened me to the natal birth process remind me to call my mom and tell her how great she is
sometimes i will ride the free one that ikea provides and shut my eyes and pretend that i am on me own yacht somewhere far away from this zoo laugh at me if you will but i will only open my eyes to catch the incredible view of downtown we happen upon then i step off when it docks and get back in line again and head straight back home sometimes i will do this three or four times yup the good life
first of all can i stab the people who failed to mention the fact that this place is beer wine only brian d im looking at you now that in and of itself is not inherently bad i love both beer and wine but not knowing led to disastrous consequences because my aging liver cannot predictably handle mixing different types of alcohol one fine friday night i mixed up a cocktail of lemon seltzer st germain elderflower liquer vodka and fresh meyer lemon juice i poured even amounts of this concoction into empty poland springs bottle so that my friend cari and i could swig from them on our jaunt over to the west village i had made a strong beverage so we each had a good servings of liquor in us by the time we polished off our plastic vesselsit was late well past midnight possibly almost am when we stumbled into this dimly candle lit immensely cozy but not drab or shabby little bar as you enter there is a long bar and then a narrow seating area behind it with the single bathroom at the end and to your left is a second room with more comfortable loungelike seating both rooms are small but not cramped theres a lot of stone and wood and warmth here it wins full points for decor and ambienceit was fully packed though thankfully not quite crowded and after a few minutes we acquired seats at the bar the wine and beers offered by glass bottle and draft all grace a huge blackboard in neat chalk letters the selection and range impresses especially when it comes to the beer this would certainly be a place to get nicely buzzed off a few belgian ales i think sadly i feared mixing beer as it was i feared mixing wine but i had to pick somethingwe chose a bottle of zinfandel old vine ca and it was very solid for the price i was pleased sadly after about a glass the evil spins of alcohol doom set in and i was forced to spend about an hour with my head on the bar it was shameful but my friend took on the role of chatting up our neighbours who consisted of first a beerswilling alcoholic who begged her for a taste of wine if you want to give him some of your share go ahead then later a goldtoothed black man obsessed with organic food and his lumberjackstyled friend whom cari and i considered fuckworthy if a bit dimgoldteeth seemed to take an interest in me perhaps thinking i was actually drunk and would welcome his affections but alas i was still able to lift my head for brief moments to spout rebukes to his attempts at conversation at one point after returning from the bathroom eww goldteeth dared to touch my hair why do guys do this wtf which almost resulted in a smackdownfortunately i was mostly kept distracted by the superb music the bartender a musician himself selected which showcased some excellent indie rock tunes without a doubt the best music i have ever heard played in a bar or drinkingplace of any type i kept asking him to tell me names which i stored away for later purchase film school and jeremy enigk were among them and the guy also mentioned smooth but my googlefu failed me on that last onethe bathroom is quite nice and surprisingly not that small definitely better than in your average corner or dive bar the service was lovely the drinks are great albeit liquorfree and the crowd is cool if not a wee bit interesting at moments ill be back sans vodka preloadcash only

what do you mean no photographs please i questioned the menu aloud king looked at me shaking his head reinforcing the message written in fine print at the bottom of the menu minus one star for your review later he said and smiled but i couldnt resist its not that im a lawbreaker at heart or a contrarian like kingits just that the two fine slices of cake placed before us were too beautiful for me to desecrate without savoring the memory for laterso i stole a few stealthy glances then pulled out my cellphone pretending to check my messages i undertook the secret operation of capturing the classy images forever on my phone sleek and clean in its design the luscious gateau au chocolat shone brighter than the silver fork beside it and the contrasting snowwhite cheesecake next to it made the snapshot complete the tastes were just as wonderful as the pictures sweet and pungent the cheesecake slid smoothly down the throat and the rich chocolate cake caressed the jaw with a tingling sensation my god i thought bite after bite they were quiet momentseach moment a simple satisfaction for the taste buds a moment where the decor of the store made sense its white walls and clothingboutique feel melded gracefully with the classic silhouettes and chic tastes of the desserts uniting the senses into a glorified experience surely id love to listen to kingwho recommended lady m and accompanied me on this excursionand take away a star from this review for the inconvenience of capturing the memories lawfully but at this defining moment in my limited dessert eating experience i weaken at the knees at the thought of my beloved lady and cannot but kiss the picture on my phone and extol both cakes with five stars and to be fair ill take the average of the two and brand lady m with five stars as well

let me tell you about the only us president born in new yorki stumbled upon the tr bplace by chance many times i had walked back and forth this stretch and i had never noticed the unassuming plaque announcing the landmark it took me two seconds to decide whether or not to enter why not let the cerebellum enjoy yet another slice of historythe townhouses interior is a rebuilt replica of teddy roosevelts uncle robs house the place where he was born and it houses a great many things concerning the late president of the united states until yesterday my knowledge of theodore roosevelt was scant i knew that he had succeeded mckinley after his assassination that the original fbi was created under his presidency by a distant great nephew of napoleon bonaparte that he expanded monroes doctrine of intervention in latin america under the roosevelts corollary and that the teddy bear was actually named after him thats it but i learned many things that as the tour progressed made me ashamed at the pusillanimous nature of todays leaders and politicians theodore roosevelt was indeed what they call him nowadays a rough riderborn into a wealthy and philanthropic family of southern roots he inherited his dads active engagement to social causes and amongst other things tr was one of the first persons ever to talk about the protection of natural habitat or land for the sake of environmental health and patrimony in fact he was the forerunner of the government owned historic sites so that places like the grand canyon or others could be put under the protection of the federal government and inaccessible to public plundering very much like prosper merimee did in france decades earlier he was also a true adventurer in the true sense of the word joining the us army cavalry in the spanishamerican war authoring over books on many subjects going on expeditions to africa and the amazon for biggame hunting and actually bringing home an impressive collection of plant and animal specimens for both the smithsonian and the american museum of natural history which btw he helped found and is named after him and skinny dipping in the potomac when not dictating policy nice i would like to see clinton or gw pulling that one for the paparazzisthe townhouse houses many mementos and personal items of tr including the shirt spectacle case and book he was wearing when an assassins bullet attempted to take his life a replica of the nobel peace prize he won for brokering the peace between japan and russia which btw he was the first american to ever receive the laureate personal papers journals quills many family pictures and even his baptism baby dress come for minutes while you watch the displays or join the short tour given by george the historic sites ranger who is very knowledgeable on tr and american history in general and will answer any questions you may have upstairs they have a research library which is used by many current historians and others and as i learned by known author david mccullough come to skinnydip yourself outside todays context into a time when men were men and come back just in time to upper your standards on what a leader should be made of soft and erudite skin but with fierce determinationa teddy bear

all of this really happenedmaybepossiblypossibly notcame here tonight after dinner at nearby sura with the previously mythical and mystical sienna k who seemingly appeared out of nowhere in a cloud of magical smoke now whether that smoke was real or not i can neither confirm nor deny because i was a bit drunk upon my initial entrance i do know we came here to load up before we headed to pdti ordered a drink with vodka ginger ale lemon juice and something i wish i remembered the name of it and for some reason the inconceivable comes to mind but i dont think thats it sienna had the cloud nine and both drinks were delicious but thats not the best partit was crowded tonight so we had to sit at the bar at the bar was a gentleman named chris he noticed that i had a red sox ski cap on and he was offended because hes a diehard yankee fan not only that his various cousins are publicists for the yankees the jets and the knicks want more hes the district manager for the restaurants amber amber ii and two other restaurants that i dont remember more his uncle owns maru in ktown and he knows matthew k who designed maru and calls him a visionary genius still more his aunt owns gagopa karaoke in ktown and yet even more he bought a round of shots for me sienna and all the bartenders oh excuse me he bought two rounds of shots for me sienna and all the bartenders this dude chris is deserving of his own review but im here to talk about angels share so yeah angels share is a most awesome place even sitting at the bar was very enjoyable not the least was the fact that sienna and i were hella buzzed oh sorry sienna and i had a grip of drinks and were mad buzzed like she said the joint is straight out of a shot in a wong kar wai movie with one of the bartenders even resembling tony leung i loved that they were all dressed to the nines with vests white shirts tie and the arm bands very crazy next time hopefully we can score a table in the back lounge but if we have to stay at the bar and chris is there then we are parking ourselves at the bar chris made angels share go from five stars to five billion stars and he doesnt even work therewe never did make it to pdt especially since we could barely make it down the stairs and just like that sienna just poofed and disappeared like the urban legend that she is so i can neither confirm nor deny that she really existed because i may have been really drunk and just imagined the whole thingall of this really happenedmaybepossiblypossibly not

recommended for premium wines libation tastings oenophilesservice selection quality stores are a dime a dozen in ny and it takes a lot to wow a person sure you can go around the corner for convenience and pick up a basic bottle but if you desire an experience great selection and knowledgeable staff then moore brothers should be on your list of places to seei came here for a wine tasting recently they do not do them often but when they do it is quite an experience unlike other places that have tastings where you are in the front of the store or browsing and trying not to nock over bottles moore has a specific tasting section in the upper level of their store this entire floor is for entertaining and they do a very good job at it there is a coat room a table of cheese especially like the maps of italy france and germany where they showcase the different wineries and regions very educational and i do consider myself an oenophile of sortsat the tastings they actually have someone from the vineyard there explaining some of the wines the process and their own personal commentary i found this to be really great addition to the tasting and recommend others do this as well the staff at moore brothers was equally knowledgeable and helpful in describing and discussing the wines they were pouringdownstairs is a large selection of wines well laid out in a modern design and decor as daniel m said they are wine importers and only carry wines which they deal with while this limits the selection the quality can to an extent be assured i like how the inside of the store is kept very cool to keep all of their wines in good order this doesnt mean that you need a jacket when visiting but it could be a bit nippy which i actually like mb cares not only about their wines but also their customers and in that regard they are a topnotch supplier thats definitely won this guys heart or at least my taste buds and liversean approved absolutely definitely yes
my experience with todays maid was nothing short of awesome after we signed our current lease but before we moved in we discovered that the previous tenant was kind of well a nightmarish slovenly human cesspool who left all kinds of filth and vermin in his wake roaches fell off the ceiling when we were waiting for the cable guy there was some weird scum on all the light switches and that sickeningly sweet smell coming from the kitchen didnt disappear after our sweet landlord scrubbed out the fridge it was frass whats frass frass is roach feces roach feces pause pause sorry i had to go take a shower it just makes my skin crawl to think of it anyway frass forms an enamellike substance that looks like spatters of burned cooking grease and its incredibly hard to scrub off and it was allllll over the inside of our cabinets up high where we couldnt even see while standing on a stepstool ladder before we signed the leaseit was too much for me way too much for me to deal with so i asked friends for recommendations and my pal martha gave me the number for todays maid todays maid had their driver drop off flora right on time someone at the office had relayed my instructions really clearly to her and she already knew what areas i wanted her to focus on it took four hours to finish the kitchen bathroom the only rooms we needed help with it really was that bad she was working hard the entire time she was here when she finished the tile sparkled from floor to ceiling and my cabinets were free of frassenamel and that sickly sweet stink bonus points to flora for not flinching even as i smashed roaches with my bare hands on the counters shed just scrubbed i cleaned those up myself anything else wouldve just been rude her vigorous cleaning stirred up the survivors the exterminator hadnt gotten a couple of days before im so pleased with the thorough cleaning convenience of having all necessary products brought to me and the professionalism of the maid and coordinators i spoke with on the phone for an inaugural hour cleaning a huge comprehensive box of cleaning supplies which spared me from having to shop for them myself tms set me back thats it thats all its not a luxury im going to use all the time because im fine with cleaning up after myself but cleaning up after nassssty prior tenants todays maid all the way
joes pizza is the great equalizer for ny pizza lovers alike no matter what style you prefer you have to take your hat off and pay respect to this slice if you havent tried it yet shame on you you pizza slacker the joes slice crispy cheesy thin large just the right amount of sauce not too much but if you dont like move on like new york it doesnt give a shit what you thinkeveryone remembers the first time they had pizza at joes its like a nyc milestone experienceas for me joes reminds me of my father as a little girl id watch a younger version of him say lock the doors before running out of our beat up vw to grab a slice simply because i was hungry hed wait on line and smile back at me shivering through the winters cold through the years my father went from being in nypd uniform to transforming beneath undercover attire to finishing his career in a fancy suit and tie as a big shot detective his favorite pizza spot remained the same and slowly it became my favorite too he could have easily told me to run out and get the slice myself while he waited instead yet there was something simple thoughtful and unspoken about his kindness kindness surrounding a joes slice late at night years later im and donning my purple graduation robe my dads older now too with saltnpepper hair driving in the black mercedes hes always wanted and paying a price for all his years on the nypd a crippled gait that warrants the use of a cane but of course hed rather keep his dignity as our night comes to an end we somehow end up at joes you wanna slice lock the doors nicole he runs out with a limp and comes back and hands it over with pride maybe a little different this time maybe not maybe its exactly the same and it always will be
it is very hard to pick a locale to be your review you want it to be somewhere special somewhere interesting but if it was so special and interesting why didnt you review it in the last reviewsi considered holeinthewall pizza places bars ive been to a couple of times restaurants i worked at back home and finally decided to review my dry cleaner who i see more of than anyone in my family then i was making dinner plans for this evening with a friend and suggested that we go to petite abeille for some mussels because its great and one of my favorites and suddenly like a beacon in the night i had my review end verbose introductionstart verbose review this location of petite abeille is like an upscale belgian diner many people choose to sit at the bar and there are some small tables throughout and in front of the restaurant everything i have had has been very good croque madame ham cheese and sunnysideup eggs on thick pressed bread the belgian waffle dessert the steak au poivre so tenderthe selling point for me are the mussels theyre always plump and sweet and they come in a bunch of sauces though im partial to a standard wine and garlic the selection of beers is very good all belgian and the bartenders are eager to help you select a pint service is very friendly and attentive and im amazed at how quickly the tables turn there without ever making you feel rushedthey have a bunch of deals that ive never taken advantage of allyoucaneat mussels seems crazy to me because their regular portions are so huge but there are also price bottle of wine nights and other promotions listed on the website petite abeille is my answer to a quick bite and is a staple of the gina nyc dietthank you takes bow
pride and prejudice cmon you knew this would happen one dayit is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large appetite and seated in a chic restaurant serving a cuisine not his own must be guided through the experience however refined the cultural sensibilities of such a man maybe he is rightfully considered a village bumpkin who must be saved by his discerning female dining companion from the faux pas thats just waiting to happenelizabeth however had different motivations as she surveyed the clay pottery hanging on the ceiling she took in a moment to cast a glance at william t fitz wtf darcy he seemed an odd mixture of reserve sarcastic humor and a sense of personal pride in his taste that bordered on arrogance while charmed by his wellbred manners she had been slighted by his response to her suggestion that they dine at pylos there isnt a single greek restaurant outside of astoria that would not be a punishment for me to dine at would the experience at such an assembly indeed be much superior to that of consuming gyros in the wee hours of the morning after a teteatete at a speakeasy while lively and with a playful disposition strong minded elizabeth found this position rather ridiculous and was determined to give him one of her setdownsas the server poured a glass of cabernet agiorgitiko monemvasia peloponese she leaned forward to inform mr darcy that she would like to decide their fare for the night she disarmed him laughingly i do so that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste darcy leaned forward indeed i do not darethe first appetizer was poikilia a trio of dipping sauces tzatziki thick tangy yogurt dip taramosalata lemony fish roe and melitzanosalata grilled eggplant and extra virgin greek olive oil as she dipped the warm pita bread in the dip elizabeth inquired of darcys views on human weaknesses that exposed one to ridicule she also asked whether he found the tsatziki similar to that served by a street cart vendor darcy ignored the latter question and chose instead to clarify the difference between vanity and pridesoon the next appetizer was brought to the table ta afrata keftedakia tis dianas the fragrant and flavorful meatballs were as close to perfection as elizabeth had ever encountered when she saw darcy eating quietly it dawned on her that amazing as they may taste it appeared that he had resolved that no sign of admiration should now escape him steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words through this coursethe third of the mezethes was now upon them octopus braised in sweet and spicy red wine served with fava puree as elizabeth shook her head darcy smiled ever so slightly while drawing the attention of the waiter to bring them some lemon to enhance the flavor the waiter returned soon and brought along the final appetizer for the evening saganaki tou merakli three greek cheeses melted in a pot darcy commented upon the conscious preference of the mezes over the entrees elizabeth paused to respond surely one as culturally aware as yourself mr darcy would know that is the preferred way to enjoy the cuisine darcy struggled for composure i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavor at civility i am thus rebukedin the absence of a response and to overcome the uncomfortable silence that followed darcy commended elizabeths restraint in forgoing chocolate ouzo spiked chocolate mousse that was dear to her heart in favor of authenticity the warm galaktobourekakia buttery phylo triangles filled with greek custard and drizzled with cinnamon and honeyafter a few bites of the excellent pastry elizabeth addressed the issue i trust mr darcy that you never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice but it is incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly darcy responded agitatedly i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power not to concede my earlier judgment but my feelings will not be repressed anymore you must allow me to tell you how much i ardently admire and love the food at pylos it is decidedly worthy of ones affection and not beneath it
last week a bunch of us got together to watch the nba playoffs and we ended up picking up some pies from di fara my wizards went on to beat down the cavs by points and we ended up getting pies plain porcini pepperoni and sausage first of all i hate pepperoni like it stole family property the kind you get from papa johns and pizza hut are always salty greasy and crunchy at the same time how do they get that way you gotta try to get anything to suck as bad as the pepperoni does at most places alas i suffer in silence whenever i have to get pizza with friends people get surprisingly pissed off when you criticize their favorite toppings the loneliness of this pizzatopping stigma has followed me my whole lifethis pepperoni that dom uses was unbelievable chewy thick and shaped like a tire instead of a frisbee not too salty not too greasy it was amazing i loved this slice of pepperoni so much in fact this slice challenged every preconceived notion i had about pepperoni it shook my fragile id to its very core in a delicious way all of the toppings were fantastic the porcini was great and so was the sausage all of the toppings were sliced surprisingly thick but none of them were overpowering the blend of cheeses was the proverbial mvp and the oil and basil were nominated for the man of the year award only to lose in an extremely close contest to the handmade crust this was by far the best pizza i have ever had so if there are any other pepperoni haters out there who read this review you dont have to suffer any longer please get a pepperoni pie from di fara you owe it to yourself

sandwiched in between a dunkin donuts and a some other conglomeration on a particularly unattractive and homogenized stretch of hwy trovatos stands proudly in its own building surrounded by an often full parking lot know by area locals trovatos is a few miles down the road from lodi where the fictional mobster haunt from the sopranos vesuvios was located lodi also was the location for the also fictional bada bing and satriales pork store it would not be an exaggeration to claim that trovatos hosts mafioso on a daily basis but without all of the hollywood pomp and circumstance lacking the elegance and glamor of its fictional counterpart trovatos is still an attractive place to eat my father was for many years the borough manager of lodi and ate lunch here on a weekly basis over the last fifteen years or so i have accompanied him on many occasions i had not been to trovatos for about six years until last night since he and my stepmother moved to south jersey last week when my father told me that he and my stepmother would be making a rare trip up to north jersey and that we would be going to trovatos i was as excited as a six year old going to disneyland i my father who the family has always called uncle junior stepmother ginney cousin kathleen and husband mark my aunt zina and uncle joe arrived at trovatos at about oclock after beating the friday night traffic my father was greeted by an older waiter that knew him from years past they exchanged pleasantries in italian and we were all quickly seated at a large round table scanning the menu i made sure that they still had one of our favorite appetizers escarole and beans listed under vegetables i was very happy to see that they did we ordered two carafes of the house wine one red one white for house wine it was more than adequate but if i were choosing i would have selected one of their many other wines fresh warm delicious bread was delivered to our table with garlic infused olive oil as we looked over the menu and sipped our wine the waiter placed a complementary plate of the best bruschetta i have eaten on the table along with five excellent house saladsto start we ordered the escarole and beans fried calamari and fried zucchini for main i ordered the linguini with shrimp and wild mushrooms my father went with the rigatoni in vodka sauce my stepmother chose from the specials ordering the penne with escarole beans and shrimp mark got the shrimp scampi my aunt ordered the filet of sole after that i lost track of what everybody was having our appetizers arrived and i was worried that all of the anticipation that led up to this moment would now let me down when you remember something so fondly it is most times hard to go back and it is rarely as good as remembered i squeezed lemon over the escarole and beans and lifted the fork anxiously to my lips the first thought that came to mind upon tasting was how can escarole and beans sauteed with a little garlic and olive oil be as magnificent as this it was not as good as i remembered it was better the calamari dipped in their chunky medium spicy red sauce was also perfect the fried zucchini was delicious but i mostly kept with the former twoour main courses arrived in massive white pasta plates the first things that i noticed were the four huge shrimp that adorned my pasta large juicy and flavorful i had not seen their like since dining by the mediterranean the pasta itself was perfectly al dente this all came in a wonderful light red sauce with scrumptious wild mushrooms i dont believe that this dish could have been betteri tried my fathers rigatoni and it too was perfect as popular as vodka sauce has become i think it is hard to find a truly excellent one look no further trovatos has achieved excellence i then tasted my stepmothers penne with escarole beans and shrimp the flavor is similar to the appetizer but with the same afore mentioned giant shrimp though wonderful i would always probably go for the appetizer over this main dish so i could try other flavors when i have the opportunity to eat here my last taste test was of my aunts fish to me filet of sole has always seemed to be on the boring side of the culinary rainbow my aunt zinas meal being the proof contrary to this opinion the fish was a buttery marvel erupting with flavorlike a man in the desert i knew if i didnt pace myself id never make it out alive so i didnt try the other three dishes they all looked very good and everyone was more than content minus my cousin who mistakenly ordered a red saucein the end we sat there sipping wine the table littered with doggy bags and the older waiter brought over a large glass tube leaned against his shoulder filled with grappa and two whole fresh pears and as he had always done filled a small snifter with a metal ladle for each of us on the house

this past monday my college buddy and i ended up at sakagura after we couldnt get reservations at nobu at a decent hour and paper moon was apparently no more both places ive never been to a lot of effort just to eat however our back up back up plan sakagura turned out to be a real gemsakagura is hidden in the depths of a nondescript office building off st a short jaunt from work upon first entrance you start off by walking down a brightly lit white corridor turn the corner through some seemingly random door down a flight of sketchy stairs and enter magnificent sakagura first thing my friend told me hey check out the bathrooms uh ok theyre shaped like large wooden sake fermentation vats seriously if the bathrooms are inspired by sake you know theyre not playing aroundthe restaurant is gorgeous it was like running through a forest and stumbling into the secret village of the elves in the most unlikely place tables are set inside wooden building facades as if you are looking down an old village neighborhood at the center a long sake bar decked out in sake you havent even dreamed of yetwe were seated immediately our hostess was quite friendly and chatty the extensive sake list was a bit overwhelming largely because it was very detailed and much of it written in japanese it took us awhile to figure out the various menus i must admit in the end my friend chatted directly with the waitress in japanese and ordered everything for us my only input go for it ill try anything famous last wordsfor drinks my friend had the plum wine it was golden and tasted sweet almost like a muscadel i had a tasting sake sampler which featured two super premium and one regular sake shots set on a little tray you could really note the stark changes in smoothness and taste between the three tastingsas for the food i can only describe the first dish was spinach with sesame and a little brown sugar honestly the sesame and brown sugar reminded me of a korean songpyun only with spinach the waitress brought out a salad of lettuce tomatoes and soft tofu next it seemed more like a palate cleanser there wasnt much flavor going on even with the dressing next up chicken fried to japanese perfection that is the skin was crisp and a rich tawny brown color the flesh was warm and succulent one of my favorites then on the waitress recommendation we had shrimp wrapped in fried flour skins mandu wrap the dipping sauce seemed to consist of miso sauce with a little hot pepper paste mixed in warm and crispy with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce definitely cant go wrong there our shrimp wraps were followed up with a bowl of sweet sauce in the middle a piece of pork sat marinating the meat and fat still clinging together in a delicate little square the rich fat imbued the whole dish but didnt leave a greasy film upon tasting it was a little sweet and a lot savory with the meat falling apart with the slightest effort as a finale the waitress brought a tuna tartar half covered in cavier and the other half flying fish roe with yuzu the tuna was fresh and clean tasting i expected the cavier to make the dish a bit salty but it wasnt at all the yuzu i couldnt really taste until i let the flying fish roe roll around my tongue a bit and then the citrus taste just popped in a bold way that said hey i was here the entire timedessert we ordered two a black sesame creme brulee served with ice cream and a black sesame wafer and a chocolate souffle served with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream the chocolate souffle was hot to the touch and steamed when the spoon broke through the decadent chocolately surface rich vibrant chocolate the ice cream was a great balance cool and calming as for the creme brulee ive never met a creme brulee i didnt like the black sesame was an interesting take a more modest sweetness with a sugary crunchiness very goodoverall the food was a bit sweeter than normal from what i understand still it was pretty good and each dish was beautifully presentedjust like when wandering into a fairy tale village it is quite easy to lose track of time in underground sakagura we started dinner at and i still ended up missing my bus back home i hate it when i do that but theres an intangible comfort in talking and catching up with an old friend at a place like sakagurareview
although for brunch is a bit expensive if you take into the fact that coffee andor orange juice or something alcoholic is not included with your meal this either changed or i was mistaken chevellas makes sure your food is worth every penny my french toast was so delicious on its own that i didnt need to use the syrup they provided a lovely bottle with dried jalapenos inside no aunt jemima here it rested on a huge fruit salad which included banana papaya pineapple kiwi among other tropical fruit i could only eat two out of the four pieces and enjoyed the rest of the french toast and fruit salad over the course of the next two days since then ive fallen in love with their aguacate and milanesa sandwiches they are absolutely incredible the decor is very simple its very tiny but extremely homey i almost dont want to write such a positive review because im afraid of sacrificing prospect heights best restaurant to the hungry masses at least if im not able to get a table i finally have a place to order awesome take ou i have since moved to williamsburg but sometimes i trek back to prospect heights well the prospect heightscrown heights border just for chavellas food when i get a craving for their food it cant be ignored
its a crisp friday morning and king and i hold hands as we quietly walk towards claudes patisserie the air whistles past our ears inspiring fragments of forgotten tunes and quiet promises ahead the wind sweeps hard like slaps against our faces but palminpalm we exchange warmth thats reassuring we reach the bakery a safe haven in a side street of the west village the buttery aroma instantly seeps into the senses its early and the few small tables are empty i choose to sit by the window and as i hang my coat on my chair i gaze at the empty streets outside while taking in kings reflection on the window i see him look back at me smiling as he approaches the infamously testy claude butas if in sync with the warmth of pastries and heartsclaude and his temper seem to fade for once into the background king emerges in the forefront instead as i turn away from the cold glass and look up at him he places coffee two croissants and an unfamiliar rectangular dessert in front of me and then he sits down he is watching me now with that smirk in his eyes as he leans his back against the window i smile nervous excited and feel the warmth of the coffee tingling my nose my glance escapes and falls onto the flakes of the crispy croissants they look enticing and i soon i discover the taste to be equal the chocolate croissant sinks under my teeth its sweet lump of chocolate liquefies on the tongue and suddenly it feels like were not in a small bakery in a cold new york winter but on the set of a french romance sharing croissants in springtime king notes the change in my demeanor and offers me more chocolatefilled croissants more bittersweet coffee more promises filled with longing it all seems captivating but i remind myself to remain disciplined to deny myself the temptation and work with what i have so i suffice myself with the exceptional croissant ive just had and he pushes the mystery cake that he now calls espresso mousse napoleon toward meits caramelized crust is hard to break into and the creamy layer beneath does not bend at my will king suggests we let it sit before we try it and why not we have all the time in the world so we sit there waiting conversing as sleepyeyed passersby now watch us from the outside two openhearted people enjoying each others company untouched by the outside world unscathed by the fact that its friday the last workday of the week i glance outside the window just in time to catch a glimpse of a pair of eyes longing for time to cease for him so that he too can come in and share a warm croissant a thought a sip a feeling but today he must keep walking today hes not the lucky one we are we are the ones who sit at claudes partaking in his delicacies warming our hands hearts and palates by now ive raised the little cake and placed it on my coffee cup its cream has softened its form has become pliable and even the coffee is still steaming each bite of cake melts in the mouth but the thin layer of caramel shatters like icy glass against the teeth this taste is tougher to process than that of the croissants it still offers placating sweetness yet takes a battle to smoothen and swallow this taste lingers this taste is the one that filters through the fluffy buttery flakes and sweet chocolate of the croissants and pierces through the stuff that claude is made of the coffee washes over it in an instant and soon king and i stand up to leave hours have passed by now and we walk out in the cold again we still hold hands and as we leave the french romance and enter the real world again we take with us all of the tastes our warmth and flavors of the morningand though we dont quite know it now later well play the memory back and well remember it as bittersweet as if it were today a taste of something sweet lingers in the heart long after it has touched it

in a city full of restaurants that come and go and see good times and bad times le bernardin is an institution and rightly so i would rate my experience as one of the most flawless and perfectly executed meals ive ever had albeit the most expensivei could rave on forever about the food eric ripert is truly doing gods work in the kitchen at first bite of the amuse bouche of scallops in some sort of fennel saffron sauce i knew we were in for a treat what i wasnt prepared for was the excellent servicethe service as expected was good it was damn good it was so good that i never once had to ask for anything its like the waiters had a sense about when i needed a refill of water or another glass of wine not only were they good but they were very helpful and not overly pretentious case in point my dining companion complained that our course of sauteed skate wing was a bit too salty the waiter profusely apologized and not only replaced her skate wing but replaced mine as well mine wasnt that salty but hell i got a free skate wing out of itsome might say the atmosphere is overly stuffy the dining room decor is nothing spectacular visually the way that the servers sauce your plate after its in front of you and then explain in detail in french accents mind you about the dish you feel as if you might as well hand over the fork and knife and have them hand feed you here comes ze airplane the jacket only service which not only caused much embarassment to the gentlement that showed up without jackets but a somewhat uncomfortable dining experience as i lived the entire night in fear of spilling bernaise on a blazer that cost as much as the entire dinnerthe stiff formality and mediocre decor are forgivable because when you chomp down on the best poached monkfish thats ever crossed your lips the only thing that matters in the world is the incredible flavors in your mouth

i was nearly at tears when i walked into the staging area for the red hook ballfields food stands my friends may tell you that it was not nearly there were no sweat droplets on my cheeks they were actual tears it all comes at you like a revelation this is ityou walk into red hook park at the elbow of an l flustered thinking about which way to go people suddenly look like they are developing parkinsons go right to get that out of the way then venture leftthere might be or so vendors most sell tacos papusas quesadillas huaraches and other latin fare mostly encased by a shell of some sort there are usually available benches and tables for sitting you can also sit on the shaded grassy knoll i had chicharonesdreamlike platanos amazing they were the smushed variety with a sweet kick to them and yuca mine were cold so i could have done without for huraches which were the size of keyboards were everything we had was up there with the alltime bests had the yuca still been warm they would certainly be up there alsoalthough not as high as the chichs and plantains my god the vendors have lots of other foods that are amazing and mostly at the places where the lines are very small i dont know why people are so obsessed with the tortlilas and papusas not my thing sometimes you have to ask just to see everything they have last time i got trapped at the colombian stand and got just about everything beef on stick papas rellena fried stuffed potato fried chicken chorizo oh and ceviches at one of the last stands on the train ok now i want to go back the only thing missing are coke bottles from mexico note the actual baseball fields are probably not the best place to discover this food when we first got there i went on the actual baseball fields where there are a few vendors now i am willing to venture almost anywhere for food but they were not nearly as outsider friendly as the food grounds and i dont think they were happy about me looking into what they were cooking nonethelessis this what love is
cozy la cucaracha colony with excellent israeli food greg t and i stopped by on our way to terminal to sample their abridged offeringsfalafel are five stars for their perfectly crisp exterior and perfectly moist interior four stars for their mostly parsley flavor azuris kosher falafel are second only to holy lands in berkeley ca the latters falafel flavors are more pleasingly complex platter pickles are also five for flavor four for texture some of the pickles lack crispness but that speaks more to my preferences than to their ability chicken schwarma is tasty enough but dry sambusak savory meat pastry is also okay but its the falafel plate that shines brightly here baklava is more dense than flaky chock full of minced nuts and seasoned delicately with rosewaterthe owner ezra cohen is not at all unfriendly likely its the assertive eyebrows and the inelegant turns of phrase that make for this undeserved reputation lets just say your papa is stern like mine if true mr cohens terse affections will seem familiar perhaps even lovable by comparisonour interaction with him went something like thisec so you finish everything on plateme it was deliciousec yes delicious i know my delicious food it make you hungryec so you likeme yes oh it was soooo good ec shrug i know i know already i know
the ramen craze in nyc is about to be kicked up a notch with the opening of ippudo the famed japanese chain has finally opened shop in the ramenobsessed e village much to the joy of people like me and my fellow ramencrazed obsessed friend margie l who hauled ass in a cab to meet me here for lunch in the middle of work what a devoted ramen fan she is we both went with the shiromaru classic ramen tonkotsu ramen in pork broth with steamed thin berkshire pork slices wouldve enjoyed a few more pieces of this cabbage mushrooms and scallions i chose a side dish spicy cod roe over rice and seasoned pickles for an additional a small bowl of seasoned rice with a dollop of roe good but not sure i needed this margie got the pork over rice side which was a bit better than mineso what is so special about the ramen here well its all about the amazing broth its a really nice rich but not oily greasy milky white broth that smells just heavenly you better believe it that this thing has been simmering for hours the taste soothing a nice simple flavor though im sure its not simple to make this not too salty and even better with a bit of the freshly ground sesame seeds thanks to j t for the tip about that as for the noodles its different than the usual chewy kind that im used to ippudos noodles are thinner and lighter but still chewy enough and delicious due to this texture the noodles didnt seem to soak up all the soup as often is the case at other ramen spots as for the decor i was pleasantly surprised at how nice modern and clean the place is alot of wood a bit dark and dare i say it actually kind of a sexy vibe despite all the people slurping noodles and drinking broth from the big extrawide ladlelike spoons there are different areas to sit in including communal tables bars booths and a separate red room area in the back that supposedly can be rented out ramen party anyone loved the cool front wall decorated with various ramen bowls and the glass counter top of the bar showcasing uncooked ramen noodles the service was fast and quite friendly they were all speaking japanese to me which was fine even though i didnt understand any of it since this is all a positive indication that a good portion of the clientele is japanese or do i look japanese this place is dangerously too close right across the street from my office thus im predicting frequent visits to ippudo for lunch that broth absolutely perfect and crave worthy if youre feeling a bit hung over or under the weather i know ill be thinking about that for the rest of the day my instant love and appreciation for this place is a bit scary how could a bowl of ramen trigger such excitement but its the magic of ramen whether its all those hours that the broth has been simmering for in pork bone the perfectly chewy noodles or the soothing first spoonful in my tummy i could not have been happier with my ramen sorry setagaya rai rai ken sapporo east men kui tei etc but ive found a new love and i think im addictedupdate went again last week to experience their full menu for dinner w my other ippudo addicts the wait was pretty damn long on thur but note that they seem to exaggerate the wait time alot of folks were turning away in shock as they were told by the nice japanese lady at the front that the wait is about hours we were told itd be an hour and a half but waited about mins started off the meal on a good note with a nice sake cocktail at the bar while waiting this time i sat at the counter which allowed me to see the cooks in action on nonramen items kind of fun but a loud area to dine in since all the cooks yell out that japanese welcome greeting whenever new patrons come in to the dining area which is way too frequently but you cant really pick choose where you sit at this point given the popularity of the placei was actually a bit disappointed with some of the items we tried shrimp in garlic sauce w mushroom asparagus some special egg omelet dish much too simple and the matcha brulee green tea pudding was was just a tad better than average but the kakumi braised pork belly was excellent really tender pork meat rich in flavor and very tasty the tofu special was also greati thought about bringing down my rating to stars from but no i cant the ramen is just too damn good and thats what theyre known for im sticking to what ippudo does best and is famed for their awesome tonkotsu ramen which is more than deserving of at least stars
how could i possibly sum up all my feelings and thoughts about the world trade center in a yelp review there is too much emotional weight too much personal history and too many memories for me to express it all here so i wont i cantbut i will say that the wtc wasnt just a tourist attraction to me it was like my childhood backyard having lived in battery park city since i was years old the wtc has always been a backdrop in my life a touchstone when i was younger and people didnt know where or what bpc was i referenced the wtc as the nearest landmark when i was a high school student at stuyvesant wed hang out at the borders or any of the various shops in or around the wtc after school on particularly nice days youd find us goofing around in the wtc plaza sitting by the water fountain or spinning round n round unsteadily with our faces looking up at the sky trying to focus on the point in between the two towers and maintain our balance but instead toppling over in fits of girlish giggles on summer nights we would just lay there on the ground gazing up at the twin towers amidst the sometimes starry skyanytime i took the train anywhere i went through the wtc i would cut across through the marriots lobby to avoid all the crazy hustle and bustle of tourists and businesspeople alike in the main entrance of the south building i would line up for tkts discount tickets on the second floor whenever we had outoftown guests staying with us i would admire the huge colorful tapestry that hung from the wallthese are all memories that spark in my brain from time to time sometimes vividly clear sometimes more faded they come and go in flashes and ill often close my eyes just to let it linger in my mind for a moment longer and it doesnt take the anniversary for it to happen i still live in bpc and i still pass by the wtc site every single day i have seen how much it and the surrounding landscape has changed no i didnt lose anyone in the attacks and i was fortunate to be in college in baltimore when it happened i was even more fortunate that my mom was also out of town that fateful morning but i do feel like i lost a major piece of my childhood not a tragedy in comparison to what others have lost but any kind of loss hurts in some wayi used to be a lot more bitter about all the grief tourists who flock to the site i dreaded walking by the area and seeing all the pictures taken souvenirs being bought and sold and the occasional tour group of teenagers who didnt seem to understand a damn thing about anything but i was young and innocent once too on the very ground they were treading on now i dont care as much live and let live and if everyone else in the world could adopt that motto then maybe i wouldnt be missing the twin towers so much today

i think that given all the recent talk about the source and quality of reviews on yelp i would do well to preface my comments with how an establishment such as brandy library might be interpreted differently by the various groups reviews real real fake people fake people real reviews now seriously why do you have a need for anonymity there are enough real people on yelp who would enjoy knowing you and attaching a face to your opinions of brandy library go upload some pictures name your profile the same as how your parental units named you and get with the fake people fake reviews no brandy library is not a moving company and if you have something silly to say at least join the legions of real people fake reviews that way you can build a reputation of being a notsocredible reviewer and even have your applause meter register an enormous number of ufc real people fake reviews one might thoughtfully digress to write a review about their best friend from paducah kentucky but once you write a satirical parody on a dr mastrobattista as an example you squarely belong in this category such reviewers tend to come and go they also tend to write well and one can only hope they mend their real people real reviews i have tried to associate myself with this category knowing fully well that writing on yelp is after all a nice hobby nothing more well it is also an avenue for running into interesting folks who i would otherwise not meet in my line of work or outside i can imagine being a hella good writer but likely will never be onenow that i have that out of the way i must say that i was very pleased with my visit to brandy library and would rate it as the best place for an afterwork drink bar none assuming you can get inthe library has an extensive selection of brandies rums whiskies and cocktails and some wines and beers too while we did not stay for long i learnt enough to recognize that this is a library like no other the walls are lined with a great variety of spirits and the librarians are knowledgeable and polite ethan kelley was our spirit sommelier articulate and welcoming my gin gin mule was wellmadesweet and spicy as promised had my friend and i stayed longer i would have tried one of their rum gin or whiskey based cocktails for my second drinkthe setting at brandy library is a little too old boys club for my taste and the crowd has more than its share of the wall street and law firm types but that said i wouldnt even begin to compare brandy library to campbell apartment with its unpleasant service and snooty staff and crowd alikei learnt that brandy library also has a spirit school with tuesday evening seminars on various spirits such as cognacs and bourbons they do private events as well and hold tasting events on fridays and believe it or not you can store your spirits in their facilities i assume for a fee you could also become a member but i didnt check on the terms of membershipbrandy library is within walking distance of my apartment with the wintry winds blowing in our faces and given the difficulty of getting a cab here to take me home i was prompted to downgrade brandy library to four stars but real people with real reviews dont do that sort of thing i am told
recommended for good time with friends a date place to meet an old friendservice drinks ambiance been to angels share a few times and each time it does not disappoint concealed behind a door in youll find this lounge at first it screams gentlemans club dark woods jazz bartenders in vests and bowties thankfully this lounge is a place to unwind relax and have a good timeas a party of we waited for about minutes which was sooner than we were initially quoted the front section of the lounge has the large mural and is slightly louder they have a no standing policy so if you see another group of friends you cant hang around their table and block the hallway i attribute this again to the gentlemans club analogy they are trying to create an air of sophistication enjoyment and refinement in the back are plush leather sofa chairs that have you sink into them ideal for getting closer to your datethe drink menu is in a binder great for all people who loved cocktails infused drinks or strait up alcohol i went with a ginger infused vodka or was it earl grey infused vodka with ginger anyway the drink was gingery it couldve been stronger but again this is a mellow date place where you dont want the first drink to knock you out she had an infused vodka with grapefruit juice and tonic then she took my drink which i was nursing our friends had some food which smelled and looked good but cannot comment further than thatif you have small groups of say no more than this is an ideal place even more ideal for a date low lights sultry sounds and good drinks will definitely put lovers in the mood to get to know each other a little closer but if you have a larger more rowdier group head on over to decibel where this place is sophistication and refinement decibel is pure hilarity and funupdate back countless times recently s j b and i came and had an awesome time i had a hot earl grey with gingery vodka omg this was awesome another ginger cocktail and my partners in crime had scotch a martini and other drinks we had a lot that night and this was the bara we hit p we ordered yakittori and kara aagi and both were delicious i think they got it from yokocho not a few weeks go by that you wont find me here so what are you waiting for gosean approved absolutely definitely yes
when faced with the pressure of coming up with a date activity for a date with someone you really like you gotta go with the classics even at on a saturday night it took us min of intense tourist saturation mullets and italians and fanny packs oh my to get to the top a few tips go at night its open until the lines are shorter and personally i love the skyline at night buy your tickets online in advance its one part of the line youll get to skip skip the photo on the floor the extra to get to the floor and buying anything from the gift shop seriously you dont need that empire state building christmas ornament no you dont put it down go when its warm its cold out therebut the view was truly breathtaking and worth the wait although i did have some nice company classic new york classic romance not bad for a first date if i do say so myself
my humble and halfbaked attempt at noir fictionso this is the place everyone is talking about i thought as my friend and i stood on the sidewalk after crossing seventh avenue little would i have guessed it was there had i not carefully written down the address from the outside the building looked rather nondescript but for the small dark red door at the corner as i pulled the door open only to find a small wooden stairwell leading downstairs i hesitated for a moment and wondered if i really had it right isnt this some ones basement are we ever going to come out of there alive but my curiosity took over and i proceeded to start down the stairs followed by my friend behind two heavy black curtains we discovered a small and quiet lounge darkly lit and somewhat empty at this early hour in the night we were greeted by a hostess and while waiting for a table we walked to the bar where a rather strange looking bartender asked us what we would be drinking can you recommend any cocktails i asked slightly intimidated but knowing better than to order my usual grey goose tonic in a place like this one what kind of liquor do you likevodka bad choice pick again maybe gin white rumgin sounds good my friend answered ill take the rum said i he then proceeded to ask us what sort of drink we were in the mood for something short strong sweet fresh fruity and another whole plethora of adjectives we never would have thought could qualify a cocktail the looks on our faces must have betrayed our puzzlement and we simply entrusted him to surprise us with something good then began the magic and the alchemy in a carefully orchestrated dance juggling jars bottles and cups he frantically took to pouring cutting measuring grinding and shaking as if possessed by some obscure power only to manifest itself in the dark and plush recesses of this small new york basement speakeasy after a few minutes of gesticulations the two mysterious concoctions materialized and were poured filling our glasses to the brim with an exact precision after handing the man a large tip we took a sip our anticipation was replaced by bewilderment as it dawned on us that our drinks short of qualifying as nectar of the gods were with little doubt the best cocktails we had had in new york city a booth had become vacant we took our seats on the leather couches and abandoned ourselves to the degustation of our perfectly crafted drinks with faint smiles on our faces signs of our tacit realization that we had uncovered a gem

be prepared to show your boobies a lotthis is a full service bra shop therefore you cannot come in and browse for what you want you go to a counter where a salesperson looks you up and down and then asks what you are looking for they will tell you what size you are not ask youre probably wearing the wrong size anyway you tell them if you want an everyday bra a special bra strapless etc or something else they have everything there then they bring you into a dressing room where you are to strip from the waist up and wait for the salesperson to come into the room with you and give you the selections she has picked for you sounds scary ok the first time you go it is especially if you havent flashed your tatas to strangers in awhile these women have seen everything and i mean everything because this place specializes in hard to fit tits small ones big ones huge ones square ones wait what ok not square ones but regardless of your shape and size this store has the bra for you and will make your bazongas look great its like getting a boob makeover and i recommend it at least once a year the prices are higher than bloomies or lord and taylor but i dont think they are sizing you at those places seriously if this shop doesnt make your girls stand at attention no where will
i have been wanting to try via quadronno ever since i heard from different people that via quadronno makes the best cappuccinos in new york and after months i finally got to try them and they did not disappoint as the lovely jessica b says this place makes relentless foam my cappuccino was so thick so creamy so utterly delicious so superlative if i lived in this neighborhood i would likely be a twicedaily customer my friend and i split a cookie a tiny thumbprint cookie difficult to split and even though it was so tiny i swear it had a pound of butter in it it melted right on my tongue the service is friendly and efficient and the staff knows their product the seating of the cafe section is very rustic which means little wooden seats or benches and tables so tiny that if you are taller than you will have trouble fitting your legs under them the restaurant inside is cozy and lively and the outside is inviting and festive with lights and a decorated awningthe only minuses of via quadronno are the high prices you are paying for quality though and the crowd i think i saw every color ralph lauren cable knit cashmere sweater ever made on the men here typical ues old money foamy smooth creamy buttery stars cant wait to try their food

i was there today for the second timeits a very good burger the fries were a little overdonethe burger isnt as good as shake shack but what isburger joint gets very crowded around and there is a very long line being that its on street the line if full of dweebs in suitsone of the dweebs a tall one decided to be a prick today while i was carrying my food the the table he wouldnt get out of the way so i could pass he had room but hes a dweebso i took my forearm and shoved him out of my way exclaiming get the fuck out my way bitchseeing him scuttle away made my burger taste even better
wow this is the best espresso i have ever had in the usa ever i wanted to climb inside the cup and bathe in the smooth delicious rich but not bitter dark and tasty goodness i actually ordered a double cappuccino but the barista here so eccentric so great makes a very dry cappuccino i liked the sparing amount of milk but i bemoaned the small quantity of foam a at most especially because it was extremely good dense succulent foam ill ask for lots more next timei also ordered a manual not machine drip coffee to go which was tasty for drip coffee and insanely overwhelmingly strong i had to add whole milk in equal proportion in order to get my coffee to the desire mediumbrown lightness and be actually drinkable thats sort of how filtermanualdrip coffee is and it was tasty and powerfully caffeinated but ill stick to the espresso drinksthey offer breakfast specials at am on a sunday morning this place was jam packed and i tried a bite of spanish onion frittata it literally melted in my mouth it was so delicate and tender and cloudlike allowing the pure sweet onions to shine through flavourwise the pain perdu with fresh ricotta is also utterly amazing and the other pastries looked just as delectable i must try them alli love that they use organic milk organic valley my preferred brand and organic soymilk silk and only offer natural turbinadostyle sugar nothing but the best here no compromises pure excellence
beam me up scotty great vibe dim lighting chill not overly loud music and a tiny little bar that looks like a transporter for the starship enterprise okay i was craving a burger after listening to the owner of rare talk about specific cuts of meat and let me tell you im still thinking about the burger here at landmarc the landmarc in the time warner center was horrible compared to this cozy little spot downtown yeay downtownlet me just keep this one short and sweet the bartender spilled my entire xtra dirty martini on my lap and im still giving them starsif you order something other than the burger with grier cheese on top and have the bartender give you a vodka shower then youll probably give this place or stars like you will see in some of the other reviewsdate rating up scale tbd when i go back for a burger but everyone was pretty friendly even though there were only of us at the barnote even if youre not in the neighborhood this place is worth stopping by
chavellas deftly avoids the decorative faux pas committed in egregious fashion by many other mexican restaurants in brooklyn a handful of otherwise decent mexican eateries in kings county subscribe to an almost touristy notion that the customer is not benefiting from an authentic mexican dining experience if not surrounded by an ungodly amount of gigantic sombreros a monstrous eyesore of a mural usually depicting a bullfight and music blasting at earsplitting levels from jukeboxes seemingly operated by a phantom deejay this kitsch factor tends to devalue the overall dining experience chavellas opts for a clean but more understated decor allowing the cuisine to be the focus for a first time diner rather than the worry of being concussed by poorly hung mexican headgear ever so grateful i am to have been in an adventurous mood on the sunday afternoon i decided to eat at chavellas had i opted for a more traditional item from their menu i would have been spared chavellas fabulously noteworthy southoftheborder spin on eggs benedict jalapenos are infused with a traditional hollandaise sauce to create a superb and altogether different sunday brunch experience i was very pleased that the jalapenos were subtle and not so hot as to leave me in the throes of red faced convulsions as they often do the presentation is quite amazing as wellsomething id expect from a more upscale joint rather than a hole in the wall with a big heart like chavellas while there was no line to speak of on the day i went bear in mind that chavellas is located in prospect heights a blossoming neighborhood in rapid transition experience chavellas now because i predict that the lines will soon be out the door for this brooklyn gem
as the yelp turns episode morning was the text it was around i chuckled at the fact that mr x had obviously gotten a lot more sleep than me last night or maybe he was just trying to be funny or maybe he thought that im a slothlike creature and just woke up or maybe he just hadnt thought about me until nowat this point i pressed the off button on the part of my mind that likes to make me doubt myself what do you want i wrote back i guess its my weird sense of humor or the fact that im from brooklyn but i thought that this was funnya second date came the replywhoooooooooo said the little voice this guy has balls i certainly hope he does i said i hate it when guys dont have balls it just never feels righti put down the package of scott double roll toilet paper that i had been examining and answered what about your flight back homewas canceled he wrote so is that a yesi paused no good to rapidfire text in these kinds of situations i thought he might think i like him too much then again i want him to know that i like him wasnt i a little vague last night didnt i let my aloofdrive kick in as i always do when im nervous then again hes texting me so that means hes interested yeah but he didnt call said the lv if he was really interested he would have called shut up i shouted at the lv you really know how to drive me crazy i said sorry she sniffed i was just trying to think of you and she turned to contemplate some whitening stripsi looked down at my phone and saw that i only had one baby bar left on the display my reception is never good downstairs at this cvs but its still my favorite pharmacy in the neighborhood i love getting their weekly circular on the way to the gym on sundays and looking at all of the junk food and revlon cosmetics that are on sale i might never buy them but its always exciting to know abouti climbed the stairs and wrote back ok whats the planthen no answer i waited five minutes and looked at some nail polish remover ten minutes and i had done a lap of the store wondering who in the world would want to buy bottles of coppertone sunblock just so that they could get a free umbrellabut still no answer i told you he was a flake said the lv stopping to muse over some reeses peanut butter cups why dont you get one of these and we can eat it together itll make you feel better she spoke in silky tonesa little sigh came from me as i looked at the peanut butter cups they are very good and i do love them very much i thought but instant gratification was not what i had in mind at the moment unless it was in the form of a text still no answer maybe hes in a really important meeting i thought maybe he just got on the subway maybe its just not that big of a deal to him you think too much said the little voice you are right i answered you are so right then i paid for my things and started walking home

oddly enough ive only ever been to the morgan library for lunch meetings and business events so when a friend suggested that we check out the van gogh letters to emile bernard i really thought it was high time i finally checked out at least some of the morgan librarys collection first room we entered was mr morgans own spacious room where one imagines that men decanted brandy and smoked cigars while being surrounded by one of the more exquisite private collections in new york most noteworthy are the two panels by hans memlingone can drown in those colors and mr morgan seemed to have a thing for elaborate saltcellarsmr morgans book collection is in a room with secret staircases of all things talk about excitement intrigue and romance associated with books we had a good deal of fun looking at all the titles the amounts of various different bibles prayer books childrens books etc dont miss the gutenberg bibles yes in the plural on displayas for the van gogh exhibit itself its a small exhibit but worth catching as i saw a number of paintings that i had never seen either in real life or reproduced in books among the ones i was most keen to see were one of his the pear orchard paintings which were influenced heavily by japanese paintings as well as one of his olive tree paintings from the last major period of his life when his brustrokes and colors were moving in a new direction oh and do check out the miniature marvels of the mesopotamia sealsvery curious objects and hard to believe that so much detail can be squeezed onto one minute cylinder sealand lastly in regards to those lunches at the morganthe food is quite good and service very courteous indeed this time i had the mac and cheese which was perfect on a blustery rainy day and possibly one of the very few places to get decent cappuccino in new york
dear mr mobyusually i would consider it a bad thing when a restaurants bathroom is cozier and better scented than my own you even supply bathroom spray but i imagine if i were eating strictly vegan id be quite a fartinator myself sooo although your citrus spray may result more out of necessity than conscientiousness i just wanna say thanksps your vanilla earl grey was heavenly and although it gave me impression that it came in a bottomless teapot it did not i suggest you invest in some because i really like itxoxo julia

when face to face nyc informed me that i could use this sweet goodness in order to make my girlie bits smooth and soft i was well intriguedsugaring has existed in the middle east for thousands of years but is very new to our parts in fact only a few salons in the city do the treatment an alternative to waxing it is a form of hair removal using all natural and edible ingredients sugar and honey sugar has huge antiseptic and healing properties as well which means that if you have super sensitive skin the redness will go away much soonersugaring also hurts way less than waxing though your first time applying it to your bikini area is going to hurt no matter what especially for a girl who has always shaved my aestician explained to me that this is because shaving an area for years gives it a beardlike result regrowthwise and makes removing that hair sort of like ripping a bandaid from skin repeatedlythat said it wasnt nearly as bad as i was expecting images of writhing legs and cries for my mommy were in my thoughts all day it did hurt and sting a bit after but the entire process took about a half hour and i will not have regrowth for about a month this is very nice when you are used to daily visits with your razor and even nicer sugaring weakens the hair root so less will grow back and when it does grow back it will be thinner softer and much more agreeable to the sugar ie next time i may not even need those tylenol beforehandlessons i learned during my very first brazillian bikini apparently my naughty bits were very excited to meet the sugar and parts got moist even more interestingly this is very common youd think being naked in front of a stranger with hot substances would give the area the problem with this is that when you are sugaring the area must be completely dry and oilfree otherwise the sugar sort of sticks and has to be dried with powder to be removed i hope i dont turn into a baked because sugaring involves completely organic watersoluable ingredients it also can remove dead skin cells so while you think you are just getting your hair yanked out you are really getting a great exfoliation as well i love let your hair grow before waxingsugaring i only stopped shaving about a week ago and because of that there were some fine blonde hairs too short to get without enough regrowth you cant get your best results and by the way if you have too much regrowth you better trim or youll have trouble as wellmuch like giving birth the euphoria of the results was so plentiful that i was able to hit two parties immediately after with a bounce in my steps and forget the pain which was in itself not nearly as bad as the hype if you do go to face to face ask for diane shes super sweet and happily will talk you through things which is pretty nice with the whole stranger pouring hot liquids on your privates aspect

when i first moved here i had this phobia of riding from manhattan to brooklyn and vice versa i was convinced that id be under the river on the l or whatever when the tunnel would collapse and flood with water and we would all die a horrible screaming terrifying deathwhat can i say im kind of morbid sometimesanyway on a recent trip to brooklyn i stood in the very first car and watched as we made our way across the river and you know what it wasnt scary at all unlike in my neurotic fantasies there were no gaping cracks spurting filthy water onto the tracks clanks and creaks didnt emerge from the walls as they strained to contain millions of gallons of brackish liquid it looked like a typical subway tunnelwide and solid and reasonably well lit with signal lights and other such railrelated accoutrementsmy phobia is gone now and i ride underwater with ease thanks mta you may have surly employees relatively high fares filthy stations and shitty outdated trains on most of your lines but youre still usually there when i need you and you havent killed me yetlets keep it up okay
i have an uncle a brilliant academician who even though he loves french food just doesnt like the french much he claims theyre antisemitic that its something deeply embedded in the nationalism and culture which seems an archaic concept to give life to to the point that it makes me want to pull the shades and take to bed but then sometimes when i listen carefully to people talk when they think no ones noticing or they just feel very safe and comfortable and dont pay attention to the implications of their language i can hear threads of racism or whatever and i think theyre archaic and can we just move on please its a goddamned gotcha kind of world sometimes and while denial has its benefits change isnt gonna happen without a dose of reality either my uncle being an avocational historian also told me that the french peasants buried small fortunes in gold and jewels in their land because of the french revolution when robespierre and his merry reign of terror attempted to take it all away so the peasants hid it and there it remains to this day which has a profound effect on french mainstream politics and culture and its ability or lack thereof to change and grow i think about these things sometimes because i love croissants in my world nothing good is ever unconflicted and thats just how i see things my friendswhich brings us to claudes as the search for the true french croissant in new york continues this is an obvious next stop largely because atif i said it must be claude is an authentic transplanted french pastry maker he is a little rough around the edges in french they call that charm i have no problem with it he does not say no croissant for you if you look like an american dweeb which i am not above admitting i sometimes resemble to certain unsuspecting pairs of eyes he just sells you what you want without a bunch of patter and thats ok because in new york we all do business and were not all friends ive been in the shop a few times now and ive had lemon custard tart carmelized apple pastry a pear custard gelatin over a sponge cake pastry with the word pear written in chocolate script on top and of course a croissant i also have my eye on the napoleon all were first rate better than first rate i dont even like lemon stuff but it was so creamy in a crusty mini pie shell with perfectly balanced flavors that i simply devoured it the croissant was delectable with that rich chewy buttery insideout taste and flaky exterior that marks the real deal ive given this a lot of thought claudes croissant does not resemble the classic general mythologically idealized croissant its more like if you were in paris and you went to ten boulangeries you would have ten very distinctive niche croissants none of which would be classic per se which only if you averaged them all out would amount to an idealized classic one claudes is one of the ten an excellent authentic singular sort of singlemalt croissant if you catch my driftthe apple pastry had a caramel sauce baked into it that darkened the flavor and really punched it up fantastic i know this because i got up the nerve to ask and he let his secret slip now isnt that just a french thing to do little by little i fully intend to bond with m claude on my last visit i tried a quiche after witnessing a french dad and his three kids order half a dozen of those little pielike things and then hunker down at one of the tiny tables with spoons scarfing them down followed by sweet pastries for dessert way to go france the prices for whole cakes and pies and such range from to which is not bad i suspect if you brought home one of the apple ones youd have a table full of moaning raving dinner guestsso im not just a customer now im a fan
had our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding they treated us like gold and like every other place i checked they did not require a lot of the nyc bs that seems to come when you want to bring in a group of over peeps the food was spectacular and my southern family felt at home amongst the tall strange buildings of nyc we had our own bartender waiters and we took over the back bar k area we had it all to ourselves truly an incredible experience the coordinator there devra was incredible and planned everything to the t even cute little themed menus of the prix fixe menu we chose with our names and everything on them the decor is cowgirl fun and the ambiance creates such a good time atmosphere truly a topnotch place for a big group and a lot of fun the dessert list is fab and the margaritas yummmmy

when you come here its near impossible not to eat and drink a little of everything you might say to yourself that after you finish your first big plate of something or other that the worthwhile twenty minute wait for a plate of pupusas is long enough to go in between meals after you finish that plate you start to wonder if its so bad for you to order your second big gulp sized watermelon agua fresca you might get thirsty again in a little while so why not get one for the road it really is amazing all the rationalizations you can come up with to keep eating and drinking here if i ever go through a fat elvis phase minus the sequined jumpsuits and singing and people ask what the hell happened to me my finger will be pointed squarely in the direction of the red hook ball fields with three fingers pointed back at myself
ah lombardis theres something about lombardis on a saturday nightmaybe its large pool of freakin tourists outside clogging up the worksmaybe its the one hour and twenty minute wait really only thirty or so they tell you youll have to endure in order to consume the pizzait still blows my mind how you can tell that almost none of the people there are actually from nyc hint number one not one of them is wearing even a little black other hints bad hair colorists bad hair styles bad hair days good hair days but bad hair large superstretched hummer limos dropping them men with bad jeans that come above their navels with their hands in their pockets standing around looking large superstretched lincoln towncar limos picking them all of the above theyre actually sitting outside the restaurant reading the menu deciding what pizza to for hours especially when theres a perfectly good bar across the street where they could be drinking lychee martinis while they wait like we also saying things like do you want pizza that caesar salad actually sounds men with bad frat boys with the hipness quotient of a piece of cabbage really uncool cabbage cabbage from for instance cleveland by the way did you know that people in cleveland bring beer koozies out with them to bars how freakin lame is that but i digressbut on to the pizza which is really the important part here the crust is magnificent chewy just a little burnt and dense moist in just the right way it absorbs the sauce and speaking of the sauce is superb and theres actually enough of it the cheese is fresh and tasty mozzarella now because this is fresh mozzarella this pizza is not really the classic ny pizza slice pizza but it predated it so its all your pizza is cooked in a yearold coal pizza oven theres even a bad mosaic above the oven with the year spelled in the tiles how cool is its the first pizza place in the us the one to which all other pizzas are in some measure beholden that pie from pizza hut that some douchebag in nebraska is eating right now yep he owes a debt of gratitude to lombardis sure thats not really pizza but it wouldnt be around if not for lombardisyes its a bit of a tourist trap a few years back they took over the store on the corner so now theres more room to cram the bt folks in on a saturday whatevits still a great pie at a great price the pizza is what matters and its damn good

i typically shy away from curry lane but after reading the yelps on this place i brought some very important out of town friends to this place for dinner by very important i mean they know the identity of a female who saw me at their wedding and thought i was cute and yet refuse to reveal her to me im not sure why probably for fear that i would ravage her and turn her into a mindless sexcrazed stalker or it could be that shes related to the bride and kind of young its a toss up so when they told me they wanted to eat indian i needed to make sure that the chosen restaurant would be worthy of their patronage i didnt want to take them to an indian restaurant with typical indian decor i cant stand it when ethnic restaurants try to appear more authentic by decorating with crap that i imagine would be found in the walmartequivalent in their home country oh a velour painting of lakshmi the curry must be delicious i digress brick lane was great upscale decor clean welllit surprisingly hard to find in an indian restaurant and not playing sitar music no offense to sitar music afficionados the food was also great we ordered the tikka masala and madras curries along with the tandoori chicken which was green delicious ok so were not exactly adventuresome when it comes to indian cuisine but guess what fuck you it was delicious note i noticed the phaal selection on the menu offering a free beer if you are able to finish the dish because it is excruciatingly hot all my friends know that i am always up for a food challenge regardless of whether i appear even remotely capable of accomplishing it my drink a gallon of milk in one hour contest was captured on film and its hilarious so it took much willpower to resist it i was pretty sure the image of me sweating profusely and gulping water like its liquid crack while screaming at the waiter imo git my free beer would not have aided me in my quest to get the name of the girl
ok i was really really hungry having finished back biceps and minutes on the elliptical with richard at the nysc at park but this was an amazing chicken salad on a perfectly toasted poppy bagel was it really that good yes it wasalso offering pickasalad pickajuice pickamuffin pickacookie pickasandwich pickasoup etc many menu items have lowfat and fatfree versions presumably for those who think vinyl is a perfectly acceptable substitute for leather spend your calorie allowance here its worth it

try as i may i dont see myself walking up to a girl and saying lets have a fika at least not with a straight face mind you there is nothing overtly suggestive about the proposition for fika while a verb is swedish for take a coffee break my inability to do so stems from a funny incident in istanbul turkey i got into a cab and asked the driver to take me to a certain shopping mall the cabbie turns around to me and with a broad smile says fiki fiki as i dont understand turkish i smile back and shrug my shoulders he repeats fiki fiki global citizen that i am i think he is probably using the turkish equivalent of rafiki which means friend i nod and the cabbie drives me straight to a less reputable part of the city where i can get some cheap action as i look around bewildered i realize that apparently single men who get in the cab in the evening are only looking for fiki fiki which is evidently a distortion of the queens not so chaste english i tell the cabbie who can otherwise not speak a single word of english that i had missed the memo on what the term meant and that he should drive on no seriously i did ask him to drive on but lets focus ever heard a colombian or south american pronounce that on fika shall we even though it is well hidden in a less frequented part of mid town but for staff from the nearby bank of america fika is a place for excellent coffee and espresso drinks they use arabica beans that are flown in from a premium swedish roasting company i never realized till i visited the shop that the swedes are amongst the highest per capita consumers of coffee in the world ranked coffee break in sweden is a social institution that is the equivalent of the english afternoon tea thus it is expected to be enjoyed over sandwiches or cookies fika has a selection of salads in addition to sandwiches that are made from elis bread the only thing within the shop that they dont create on the premises otherwise they take pride in saying that they cure the salmon hand roll each chocolate truffle and make each chocolate bar themselves their most popular truffle is one with a coffee cream filling other versions include raspberry dark chocolate baileys hazelnut coconut rum etcmy favorite pastry at fika is the chokladbollar the chocolate ball that is slightly larger than an unmentionable made from oatmeal coffee cocoa butter and rolled in shredded coconut this along with kladdkaka a stickymoist mudcake that is much like a brownie provide a fusion of taste and texture that i thoroughly enjoy both are lip smacking good of the many varieties of cookies i love the drommar which has a crispy exterior and chewy interior there are many others molasses cookie almond dreams ginger snaps etc to provide the perfect complement to your cappuccinoi will confess that the other reason i enjoy fika is the sweet and friendly swedish staff in my perhaps bizarro world blondes have always been smart competent driven to overcome lazy stereotypes of them it tickles me that despite the serious expression of deep concentration on her face the barista will either mess up the pattern on the well made cappuccino forget the name of the cookie hand me back more change than she should or make some small faux pas i watch with the slight amused smile of someone thinking in blonde we trust and immediately realizing her mistake such a warm wonderful somewhat flirtatious smile comes my way that one can only nod politely and smile back i thus walk a longer distance to fika as opposed to getting equally good espresso drinks made by two italian dudes at zibetto espresso barand as god gave us rationalization i tell myself its all due to the pastries and cookies really it is or maybe the excellent foamy cappuccino or the seating ah whatever i trust yelpers will commend my integrity in avoiding a non sequitur reference to swedish meatballs just to win rotd p

the first bite of their chicken turned my dinner conversation from its usual witty worldly banter to a lowerpitched version of the old japanesetoenglish translation for the female judge on the japanese iron chef heres an iron chef japanese clip for some reference my god i have never had chicken prepared this way before this is so tasty i just want to put the chicken in my mouth and savor its flavor for a fortnight or more it is so juicy it is as if the chef talked to the chicken before it was killed and asked him to be extra juicy and the chicken had so much respect for the chef that the chicken complied i never realized chicken skin was so good i thought it would be more feathery i wish chickens grew as big as ostriches so that there was more chicken skin to eaton a less hallucinatory and more succinct note this place is great you order an app or two and a whole load of skewers which at a pop cantt really break the bank the skewers contain about three bite size portions of meat each so you can share its like combining the best of the sashimi experience simple adornment to the protein you just shut your mouth and savor each pure bite and the sushi roll experience you can divvy it up bw people or have several tastes per orderthe place is small and cozy i recommend sitting in front of the preparers the man on the grill is so focused ive never seen someone turn chicken on a grill with such care a bit different than the guy with the clippers at chirpin chicken flipping the birdsnow i realize why thats considered obscene the spice looks like salt and freshly ground pepper are carefully placed on each skewer while on the grill granted its not as dynamic a show as when a hibachi chef makes a onion and oil volcano but its still cool to watchservice is great the place is small expect a wait anytime after or soheres the play by play on dishes i triedtotto salad delicious mostly greens with a few slices of chicken and tomato but the shiso leaf dressing incrediblekaisou salad seaweed salad nice size for two not a have to have but a nice way to start the mealtotto kimuchi kimchee nice crunch and spice again not a have to have but a nice startgyoza pork dumplings pretty good but not in the same league as most of the other itemsmaguro zuke squares of tuna sashimi really good miso dare mune niku japanese style organic chicken breast topped with scallion and special miso paste holy crap soooo good moist flavorful my favorite chicken skewermune chicken breast with wasabi as juicy as the chicken w scallion and miso paste but less flavorful id order two of the miso dares before ordering another one of thesekuro buta negi pon organic pork w scallion and ponzu nicely flavored shocked to say though that i iiked the chicken flavor more than pork nothing makes sense to me anymore cats playing w dogs religion making sense fox news telling the truthtsukune chicken meat ball in plain or brown sauce really tasty pounded flat and looking like more dark meat than light it was still quite juicy definitely should trykawa chicken skin tasty stuff a little saltier than the chicken pieces i expected really thin pieces like you flake off a bbq chicken but these were quite thick and created a chewy almost gummy texture not a must have but worth tryinghiza nonkotsu chicken knee meat cartilage liked chicken skin morepiri kara mune niku korean style organic chicken breast topped with spicy red paste very good didnt like it quite as much as the japanese style though i liked japanese bbq better than korean bbqless a shock than chicken better than pork but still a bit surprisingsteak skewer forgot the name but it was worth a skewer but not as standout as the chicken asparagus bacon asparagus wrapped in a slice of bacon the asparagus couldnt be crisper the bacon couldnt be rarer and smokier yeah this was goodyaki nasu miso dengaku eggplant w miso paste finally had good miso eggplant in nyc the miso paste is perfect and the eggplant is cooked so its more crispy than mealy me likeyfor drinks my shochu and fresh grapefruit juice was delicious it was the first time i ever was handed a half grapefruit and a juicer and asked to add my own juicefive starsyakitori tottoi dont know if youre massaging those organic chickens like a kobe beef cow or thats a crack rock youre grinding in the pepper grind but whatever youre doing keep doing it
a little bit of underground heavenquality baby qualityif only i could take the bartender home with me and have him available to make drinks for my friends my gooodness wed all become alcoholics the drinks here will make you dream about coming back for moreif only every other mixologist in the city would take as much pride in what they pass off as a signature drink as the people working here do its really quite impressive yum yum we want more date rating especially if your date is a jazz loverpick up scale suggestions pick something that comes with cucumbers and fruit in it dont bother drinking a plain old vodka tonic or jack and coke that would just be blasphemous
as the yelp turns episode a well worn pair of diamond earrings i thought i knew the thom barits plush decor and classy demeanor make me feel as if ive stepped into an old hitchcock movie starring cary grant i dont know about you but anything starring cary grant has got me watching so when mr x casually invited me to stop by his party at the thom bar after my rehearsal that night naturally i acceptedhowever when i arrived the lounge was empty and not a soul was sitting at the bar where are you im here i texted in the private club came the reply upon further inquiry i learned that there is also a rooftop lounge at the thompson hotel and after giving the password i was placed in an elevator and sent up two more security hosts greeted me at the top and after getting clearance i walked out onto one of the loveliest terraces ive ever been to in new york city it wasnt too big and it wasnt too smalllike goldilocks said it was just right the night was clear and shining my champagne was crisp and filled with bubbles the group that had gathered was wonderfully gracious and welcomingand mr x was happy to see me i was happy to be there
what a gem this was a lovely place to have drinks with my best friend itd be even better for an intimate date very elegant old fashioned environment beautiful carved wood original windows comfy armchairs and couches a gorgeous long bar and add to that various string instruments strumming delightfully the crowd was older being in our mid twenties we were definitely the youngest in the place but i liked that there were alot of accents british australian and professorial types it fit at midnightish on a fri night it was populated neither crowded full nor sparsely emptyit was a bit hard to find it is not within the grand central terminal as the info map indicates its on the street level a few doors down from the entrance to gct on vanderbilt stthe hostess ushered us in welcomingly despite our relatively casual attire nice jeans and dressy tops boots and that seemed to be the uniform of the place lots of jeans blazers and boots comfortable but not too casualthe drinks are damn pricey for cocktails for wine and i balked a bit at first their vintage cocktails did sound very intriguing however so my friend ordered the robber baron rum midori lime juice fresh mint and i chose the roaring twenties rum ginger liqueur grenadine lemon juice at a piece these drinks though we both heartily agreed they were well worth the price my friends midorimojito was enormous and delicious the midori is really an excellent touch the ginger liquer in my drink was tasty and good for my queasy tummy i dont really like rum but i thoroughly enjoyed my wellbalanced concoction we estimate that each drink had at least the equivalent of oz of proof alcohol quite possibly more one drink each got us significantly buzzed and we both have high tolerances impressive and so worth the moneyour waitress was gracious and darling attentive but not pushy and we had a fabulous time a full stars easily

essex is one of the most overreviewed places on yelp so ill keep it brief omg lets do a everyone complained about a bitchy hostess she apparently was gone this sunday because my hostess was lovely and gave me free drinks when our wait for a table was longer than something really sad happened to the bartender i could see the torment in his eyes sam p not that one suggests his turtle died i submit that dead turtles are the same as live oh and the place is fun and the food is delicious if you care about stuff like that the only things not so cute were the buckets of bloody mary that just looked like buckets of oh and theres something alien about those delicious onion and poppy rolls they serve you wouldnt expect it but i defy you to eat one without smearing butter all over your face
devotees know patience which in this case is the key to unlocking chaans beauty and discovering its secrets a fastpaced passerby in search of something exciting will walk past the restaurants humble facade but if you are lucky enough to stop open the door walk up a staircase and pull away two thick square curtains hanging down midwaist chaans warmth will encompass you immediately dim lit and quiet the room is filled with wooden square tables and japanese simplicity bartenders pour sake into mojitos and with the utmost care and precision chefs create delicacies in the kitchen right behind i sat int the midst of the scene feeling like i had entered a beautiful sanctuary a chocolate souffle covered in raspberry sauce was placed before me for five minutes it looked too sacred in its delicate beauty for me to desecrate it but when it started deflating i knew it was time i broke into it with my spoon and tasted a flow of sweet chocolate with a touch of cool raspberry i burned my tongue over and over but i didnt mind delightful to the senses it promised the sins would be forgiven later i only came here for dessert and when i left i felt satisfied not like a glutton feels satisfied after he pushes the empty death by chocolate crumbfilled plate aside and pops the first pants button open but like a student walking in the cold yet glowing with that quiet satisfaction of just having had the first taste of knowledge from a wise master there are more secrets here i know it because chaans delicate heartwarming creations whispered it to me and like a true devotee addicted to knowledgeand precious flavorsill listen and return
i could tell you how awesomely great these fries are and which are my favorite dipping sauces parmesan peppercorn mango chutney but after reviews you dont really need to hear that from me instead id like to tell you all a little story about the night that pommes frites broke my boyfriends heart cue the violin music pleaseit was a cold and blistery night on that new years eve two years ago my bf and i were hanging out with one of our couple friends who brought along their outoftown guests another couple after a few live sets at one of those tragically hip east village music bars we ventured over to sharaku for dinner where we realized that we had very little in common with these outoftowners we were also slightly taken aback at their apprehension in trying most items on the menu no seafood nothing raw justvegetables they do realize its only japanese food rightafterwards we walked down second avenue and ended up at the telephone bar where we continued to have very little to talk aboutexcept for the awesome goodness of pommes frites where we were determined to take everyone after a sufficient amount of alcohol had been consumed it was going to be the one glimmer of hope in this evening of awkward conversation our only salvation for delight and funso after my bf and i had talked it up a considerable amount we finally made our way down to pommes fritesonly to find that the metal gate was down and it was closed and this is when i heard my bfs heart break crrrracccckkwhat closed how can it be closed its new years fuckin eve everyones out and about getting their drink on and everyone knows that the best way to cap that night off is to indulge in some greasy fatty fries dipped in a myriad of deliciously delectable sauces what the now what im paraphrasing of coursei had never seen my bf so upset about food or the lack of it before i wanted to comfort him console him but i didnt know how he kicked the metal gate a few times as if that would make the french fry friers okay technically belgium magically appear but we all knew it was a lost cause he cursed he crossed his arms he frowned and we all watched as other new years eve revelers came by only to face the same disappointment we did it was a sad sight to see a dozen or so drunk new yorkers standing on the street waiting and hoping it was just a trick of the mindin the end what could we really do what we were looking forward to all night our version of the ball dropping had actually dropped the ball on us i dont remember how we ended the night after that letdownperhaps we had some pizza at the corner or maybe we went for some more drinks i think we just called it a night a pitiful disappointing awkward nightsince then my bf has forgiven pommes frites how can he not theyre just too good to resist but i think we learned our lesson on that fateful new years eve dont ever start a night drinking in the east village if you know you cant end it at pommes frites and dont let your cool couple friends sucker you into hanging out with their weirdo couple friends on new years eve
i had a little lunch at daniel today it was perfectthe table water tasted so good i was going to ask what it was then i saw the evian bottles mystery solvedthe dining room was big and open and airy with a surrounding mezzanine a glance at the bar as i came in made me want to go there but i was already lateit was a function so the room was filled with big round tables no matter when they took the first plates away i was sad i hadnt had a chance to properly look at them they seemed to be a beautiful pattern of yellow and white i was instead facing the other way listening to the presentation not a bad presentation but i knew the food was comingthere were three rolls one at a time like a little bread meal each one more unique and delicious than the one before and of course that french butter who needs food when the bread and butter are exquisite but there was food white wine crisp and dry and icy cold and with that champagne sweatsox aroma it sounds funny to describe it that way but thats what it was like it was delish scallops grilled on the outside slightly raw inside with shredded mushrooms exalted with flavor like a punch to the forehead and little vegetation knicknacks each a different color and shape and taste a little sauce delish a plate with a pair of meat medalions one a tenderloin and one a braised beef that melted under the fork a dollop of creamed potato another set of vegetation knicknacks each tiny bit of everything exquisite perfect charming with a red wine dry and spicy and somehow transparent going downwarm molten chocolate cake paired with thick pistachio ice cream it was so good we had no idea it was pistachio i thought lychee green tea concoction jasmine juniper it was pistachio geez not too much to eat not too little to eat plenty to taste a carnival of mouthwatering theaterthis is the real deal in its prime daniel ya mon

for most people karaoke is a simple endeavor where someone belts out a tune on a microphone while following along to the lyrics on screen japas has managed to turn this gimmick into a sophisticated simplified one and combining the best in music variety social conviviality and affordability all rolled into one venue it is easily one of the best karaoke venues in the city and deserves all of the high praise it can getthis particular japas is the best of the locations as i understand it they have monster sized private rooms and a nice outside bar for folks who prefer to sing outside rather than amongst themselves each of the private rooms are spacious utilize a functional layout so people can pass in and out freely and tables are broken up so that people arent having to revert back to one area like a coffee table the sound system is fabulous with a powerful punch of bass while maintaining a crisp level of clarity in the larger rooms there are two screens one in the front and back to allow folks to look wherever they need to without someone blocking the way in addition all the mics are wireless which is a major plus the music selection is about as diverse as ive seen with songs from around the world japanese chinese english spanish tagalog korean vietnamese for a person one can enjoy hours of unlimited karaoke with a ton of bar food chicken wings sausage french fries egg rolls chicken fingers and sushi california rolls eeladvocado salmon tuna spicy tuna shrimp etc and unlimited alcohol sake sapporo asahi coors michelob rolling rock budweiser corona heineken bass house wine etc this deal is just too fantastic to pass up especially when the food is actually goodmy first time here was marred slightly by the fact i had several members of a party not show up leaving the remaining folks to have to settle their portion of the bill service was gracious enough to neglect their portion and credit me another hour by starting me later they endured all of the indecisiveness of our group and really made the difference in our overall experience they were fantastic and without a doubt i will be back again more times than i can count
had a kickass time here last weekend when fellow yelper tony l introduced us to this brandspankin new korean noraebang note i did not use the word karaoke upon walking in i was completely wowed by the decor technology flat screens large projector screens laser lights great sound systems etc spacious carpeted private rooms and so much moregreat song selections korean japanese american friendly quick service and rather clean bathrooms a critical part of my reviews for people the tab was per hour we belted with fervor for three straight hours which earned us a free fruit platter on the house at the end of the night when we were at the front counter to pay our dues they brought out the old school korean yogurt drinks which earned them some major brownie points very nice touchid def go back preferably with a large group its definitely a place to have some serious good times with your buds

stephen colbert shot me in the faceno really heres how it went downi went the night that kucinich was on and my god was the wait long they packed the entire audience into the pastthemetaldetectorbutnotinthestudioyet room where we waited and waited and waited then one of the crew came out and told us that they were doing something highly technical and since colbert is a perfectionist theyre rehearsing it heavily and that we should be let in any minute nowso we waited and waited and waited a little more packed in like very friendly sardines and waited normally id just have been irked about this but since i broke a toe the day before it was actually rather painful and yes its my own damn fault i didnt pull the i broke a toe can i have your chair to one of the chairsitters on the sidesanyway they eventually let us in we sat we dawdled we listened to the rock music pumped in to deafen the audience to the workings of the cast and crewthen the warm up comic like the comic at the daily show his primary source of humor was making fun of audience members he repeatedly told a guy sitting in front of me that he looked like the oklahoma city bomber timothy mcvey or however thats spelled that just wasnt amusing he had some good lines but since i bet he uses them every week i wont repeat them here i get that some people seem to think mean humor is funny but i just dontso by around when i was supposed to be at a yelp free beer at colbert comes out yay he did a qa and wow the charisma just pours of this guy he can be my presidential candidate any dayafter a round of apologies for the delay and promises that the show will be hilarious stephen tugs on his wriststrong bracelet with an innocent curious look the crowd goes wild stephen starts pulling them from under his desk and shooting them into the crowd like rubberbandsand now as youve probably realized this is where he shot me in the face he wasnt aiming in my direction so i wasnt paying attention then one bracelet hit me on the cheek like an inch below my eye it stung a little but the worst part was that it bounced off my face and the person behind me got it very sadthe show well if youre reading this youve probably seen it before so you know how funny it is i dont really need to bother much with thatand yes even though stephen colbert shot me in the face i give his show stars sure we waited for ever but that doesnt seem to be the mo so i wont deduct for that and sure he shot me in the face but i doubt that happens too often either and aside from those two irregularities it was a damn good time

id brought a bunch of reading to the us open expecting to be bored i was soooo wrongfor several years ive tolerated my tennisobsessed husband using up all our tivo space glancing at the occasional shot on our dinky tv i never did grasp tenniss appeal beyond the hypnotically rhythmic taptaptap but this years us open was a revelation because almost all the courts were general admission it was surprisingly easy to grab seats courtside or very close when youre actually there with balls hissing past you at mph while greek gods are sprinting and sliding and sweating and jumping and slamming the ball with tremendous force its awesome we bought holiday twilight passes which covered sat sun and mon nights of labor day weekend mostly and round matches the passes gave us entry starting at to all the courts except ashe and reserved ashe seats starting at ie two ashe matches each night we took in more than hours of tennis in all about an hour my top three matches carlos moya at the oldest player left in the us open won an epic grueling match against philip kohlschreiber the players sheer stamina was impressive the match was so suspenseful that even folks in the neighboring armstrong court were pressed against the rail trying to catch a peek my favorite moment when we were courtside and moya took his shirt off right in front of us pic this latvian kid ernests gulbis came out of nowhere to destroy tommy robredo the guy in the world with his serve and elegantly gentle drop shot the grandstand crowd started sparse but got progressively bigger as spectators called and texted their friends youve got to see this kid the woman behind us even exclaimed ive just seen the future of tennis and his name is ernie so cool to see a new talent arrive plus he looked exactly like michael cera of superbad and arrested development roger federer played a beautiful match against feliciano lopez in the round of lopez a lefty was terrific and actually won the first set federer won the second set to tie the match but lopez was still playing extremely well in the first game of the third set federer was down my husband and all the other federer fans around us were very tense indeed but then federer turned it on he won that game and then astonishingly won the next consecutive points on his serve he was truly a joy to watch so graceful yet powerful and smart about his angles i saw him after twentysomething hours of watching other players work hard but federer he glided around that court like he was from freakin krypton david foster wallace does not exaggerate tips if you cant decide between matches in the grandstand and armstrong stadiums sit in the last row of armstrong you can keep an eye on both courts from there check out the practice courts because you never know who youll see when we stopped by lopez was practicing for his federer match john mcenroe was also there hitting balls with some kid a couple dozen fans had gathered when mcenroes ball went out the fans yelled out out mcenroe obligingly threw a fake tantrum and tossed his racket amusing my only complaints are that usa usa chants can get tiresome yes james blake fans im talking about you and that ashe stadium is simply too big you have to be some sort of corporate titan to get anywhere near the or levels where zillions of corporate seats remained empty despite having been sold out but we proles still had fun in the nosebleeds it was rowdy and we could appreciate the angles better from up high
i have worked in this business it was one of the most rewarding things i ever did like babeland formerly toys in babeland my shops catered primarily to women and furthermore my shops were located in affluent suburbs of washington dc if you think its awkward for an nyc woman to buy a vibrator or a butt plug try being a senators wife the best thing about sex is that it feels good when you do it that said imagine how sad it is when furthering the feel good do it end is hampered by any one or more than one of the followingbad lightingcareless or apathetic sales staff if there are anyleering people of the same or opposite sextacky displaysinappropriate merchandisingnobody around who reminds you of youlack of privacydiscomfort with the merchandiselack of familiarity with the merchandisedirty surroundingsthen imagine how nice it would be to examine ask and otherwise familiarize yourself with any product much less one that is going in on or around you all in perfect comfort in nonjudgemental surroundings with people who are actually trained and enthusiastic about the fact that you want to dress up like a dominatrix and whip someone consentually its heaven believe me being on the sales end is heaven too its depressing how many people have crappy sex lives when all they need is a little encouragement and support adding some life to peoples bedrooms where and when it is needed is nothing short of fulfilling lifes work and i really recommend it if youre looking for a career changebabeland strives to meet all of their customers needs you can try things outtouch them taste them see and smell them handling is encouraged it looks like a penisso what grab on and feel how it vibrates imagine it in your bedroom and head to the cash register no need to be embarrassed they know what youre doing with it and they do it too babeland also offers many classes lectures and talks on various sex and sexualityrelated topics some are a little titillating but most are informational and informative and are real gems for those people looking to become more knowledgeable about some of the more outre pastimes people pursue in private the most important thing to take away from your visit here is to remember that youre not the only person in the world who wants to do insert kinky or benign sex act here if you were stores like this wouldnt exist and that little rubber toy youre about to buy wouldnt come in colors including sparkle and glow in the dark

this just proves why i love and am obsessed with top chef bc the show provides chefs like harold dieterle winner of season with the opportunity to share his cooking talent with ppl like us and not just with padma and tom colicchio im so impressed with most of the contestants on that show and perilla is probably not going to be the only hit restaurant to come out of that show ok enough of a plug on the show on to the restaurant review itselfi went to perilla for my bday dinner recently and had a fabulous meal the appetizers were very impressive the four of us shared different dishes and i loved all raw yellowtail w cucumber salad cilantro tomato water yuzu very fresh yellowtail and a refreshing slightly tangy tart dressing crispy berkshire pork w mushrooms so delicious esp the crispy parts spicy duck meatballs w yam gnocchi and topped w a raw quail egg super good love the bit of kick spice in this dish id say this is a musthave at perillaid go back in a heartbeat for just these appetizers but lets move on to main entrees heres what i got to try grilled colorado lamb w a parsnip mousse red chard tiny little onions i shouldve gotten this mediumrare instead of medium but it was still super juicy and very nicely prepared all the ingredients went so well together even the parsnip mousse which i didnt think id care for roasted organic chicken w asparagus hazelnuts apricot puree very good for chicken but nothing id highly recommend though my friend loved it whole grilled branzino very simple preparation but a solid fish dish huge portion would recommend for ppl to share with a side ie farro risottowe also had an awesome bottle of shiraz with our meal that we all really enjoyed wish i could remember the name the desserts were pretty good incl the delicious little oatmeal raisin cookies that came w our check but not super memorable but i think that had alot to do w the fact that i was really full and not really paying too much attention to the few bites of dessert i hadthe only minor complaints that i was thinking about taking away a star for was the slowed down service towards the end of our meal and the somewhat insipid interior dont get me wrong the place is designed well and i like the narrow dining layout and love the round banquette tables nested in the booths lining one side of the wall but overall it wasnt anything all that impressive however i am not subtracting any stars since the focus here is on the food after all harold d is a chef a top chef no less not an interior designer hmm maybe next seasons top chef winner should hook up with the winner of top design and waiter outfits can be designed by the winner of project runway ha alright can someone hire me at bravo already
i have to confess ive been living in nyc for a year and had never walked into barneys and im gay no reallythis had to be remedied so i went with yosh this afternoon during our auction date wow i think i had about erections and orgasms in the minutes that i spent in there i also had about just as many heart attacks after looking at the price tags most of which involved four digits on the prada and gucci floor i was about to buy this beautiful theory winter coat which wasnt exactly justified considering its degrees outside until i realized it would cost about one months rent next time maybe hopefully so i had to settle for a cheap jack spade man purse which was probably the cheapest item in the store except for a few tshirts here and there oh and whats up with of the clientele being flaming gay guys
monday i decided i needed to rent a car on wednesday and also on frisat being memorial day weekend and on such short notice my expectations for finding a rental at a reasonable rate was pretty low i have been working on some artwork lately that requires the use of a car pretty often and a few people suggested zipcar my constant wanderlust and growing impatience with new york convinced me that zipcar might be the right idea signing up was easy easy easy the online form takes just a few minutes to fill out and i got approved they check your driving history within hours picked up my zipcard on tuesday and logged onto the site to make a reservation nervous that i wouldnt be able to get a car not a problem many cars available at different times i booked mini coopers for wed and one for fridaysaturday with no problems this morning i went to pick up the car and again no problems the car like most zipcars in nyc i think was in a parking garage no forms to fill out nothing to sign no exchanging of anything it was super easy i felt like i was stealing something i ran my errands took a long pleasant whiff of freshly cut grass out in the suburbs and dropped the car back off at the parking garage with the same amount of ease wow how could anything in this city be so easy im looking forward to friday the only downside it was too easy i can see all of my paychecks going towards zipcars just so that i can breathe some fresh air and get out of this damn city they even allow pets so my pup can come with me too
so i wandered into eds lobster bar on saturday alone and got a seat at the bar the decor is not as campy no pun intended as marys less rustic than pearl sort what would happen if a restoration hardware bathroom truck ran into eds storefront going and neatly arrayed white tile and chrome fixtures everywhere the majority of the seating is at a long bar which was staffed by moving ridiculously friendly people but to the business end the lobster roll was very buttery but had the golden ratio of lobster mayonnaise which in my mind is about the fries were a bit thicker than the two aforementioned institutions but crispy throughout and well salted the pickles were a little surprising they were crinkle cut like ruffles potato chips and had a brownish hue which in nyc i generally associate with the east river and yet had this delicious vinegar and peppercorn mix on them oh and did i mention that i was sitting next to danny meyer yeah union square cafe gramercy tavern and madison park danny meyer and he liked it too so i could give you my opinion well i think i just did but who cares what i think danny meyer liked it

tonight i saw two of the biggest balls id ever seen im sure thats not the first time thats been said in the west villagei went out tonight to meet my friend dennis who i hadnt seen for over a year and i recommended that we try piccolo angolo from all that i read here on yelp i knew that we were going to have a a great dinner i got there before meeting my friend to scope it out about it was packed i asked if they would be able to accommodate two which seemed to amuse the host he informed me that they only take reservations the only thing he had open for the rest of the night was a i took it thinking that we probably would dine elsewherei met dennis at and we decided to try to get into bar pitti we got their a little before and it was its regular zoo they told us that it would be a half hour wait since it was would be about the same we decided to take a slow walk back and use the reservation at piccolo angolo when we arrived we were promptly seated to start we shared the stuffed mushrooms stuffed with ground pork and we both ordered the linguine con polpette meatballs for main the mushrooms were a refreshingly different take on the dish usually they have more breadcrumbs than i like these didnt appear to have any when the linguine with meatballs arrived we were both shocked there were two and they were sized somewhere in between a baseball and a softball i joked with the waiter i asked for the large meatballs i said he smiled probably for the time that night from the same jokethis dish was perfect the meatballs were delicious the pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce magnificent i have a big appetite and i only ate one meatball and half the pasta i cant wait for lunch tomorrowthis is not the absolute best italian that ive had in the city that honor would go to lil frank and frank but piccolo angolo is my favorite old school throwback spot

the sport of cycling is in a shambles and we need a few strong legs a couple of sturdy wheels and a clean urine test to restore americas dignity and allow us to compete in the tour de france if you are as tired as i am of watching the utterly painful and interminable public unraveling of shamed tour de france loser floyd landis the only person i can think of in modern athletics who has blamed the presence of synthetic testosterone in his bloodstream on everything from bourbon to a french conspiracy against him then its time to act the bike path inside prospect park offers a great introductory course in cyclingnot too rigorous and ripe with plentiful glimpses of the majestic park for the hardworking cyclist to admire in passing of course as any good cycling course should prospect parks bike path has a few endurance obstacles that will challenge a good cyclist to kick their pedals into high gear and elevate their game theres one hill in particular its about of the way through the path if you start at the garfield street entrance that is likely responsible for many strained calf muscles and asthma attacks once i reach it i usually have to stop for a few moments before making my ascent so that i can mentally prep myself avid cyclists would likely scoff at my difficulty reaching the apex of a hill theyd regard as a mere bump in the road personally i find the climb much less agonizing if i can somehow distract myself for the duration of it the most effective technique has been an imagined scenario whereby a pack of hungry wallabys escapes from the prospect park zoo and follows me up the hill in vigorous pursuit of some delicious leaves tucked into my back jeans pocket their salivating little wallaby mouths violently snap at my posterior as i pedal for dear life this worksi swear theres nothing scarier than a small animal with a big appetitecycling enthusiast or not the prospect park bike path has something for even the most novice of riders me im firmly in the novice camp since i havent rode my bike in prospect park in over years its the wallabys man they hold a grudge
midday milfheavenif youre looking to pick up a mommy this place gets flooded during the afternoonafter school hours with strollers and neighborhood mommies flocking by the dozen to chow down on the infamous fat free yogurt and seemingly healthy toppingsit was funny sitting inside i felt like everyone else except for me was preggers or already had a baby in tow photos coming soon uh oh look out untastydelight these guys actually have a regular yogurt that is frozen actually resembles yoplaits vanilla yogurt and its fat free without puffed air preservatives and inexplicable flavorregular or tiramisu actually its not tiramisu its green tea but either way it doesnt taste like green tea so you can call it whatever you want still not sure why its more expensive than regular perhaps its harder for them to mass produce so they try to detour you from choosing itif youre trying their regular frozen yogurt then add blueberries to take away the bite add strawberries to make it sweet but tangy at the end bananas dont do much here but in a smoothie would be great the cereal would be interesting and id probably have to start with the fruity pebbles hmmm wonder if they have permission to use that name on their labeldate rating if youre with your health freakish girlfriendspick up scale if you like milfs and have the afternoon freestrong suggestions ask for a taste of both regular and green tea if youve never been here but whatever you do dont try to make your order complicated the girl at the front is a total degenerateps they actually have a frozen yogurt on the menu that is over
i am a lazy person so i am thrilled that this place is literally around the corner and across the street from my apartment especially on weeknights when i feel like some beers and cheezballs but i dont particularly feel like expending any energy they have great drink specials like the frat boy and the sportsmanthis is where i discovered that one can mix vanilla vodka and orange soda and end up with a seriously delicious drink that is so easy to consume that if youre not careful when you recreate it at home youll make all your underweight girl friends barf but its so good that theyll keep drinking it its called the dreamsicle at the leveetastes like a creamsicle but gets you druuuuunkthey serve crap food for cheap which i havent eaten yet but probably will in the near future they have a pretty damn nice selection of beers and liquorsyou can order a glass of chartreuse on the rocks for about i believe great prices tootheir jukebox is incredible they have everything from neutral milk hotel to the misfits with hank williams and trex in between if you ever see some dorky brunette chick in the corner quietly rocking out to gimme danger by iggy pop or underwear by pulp thats probably mei like to grab a seat somewhere suck on a free blowpop or mouth a free twizzler while alternately sipping my texas lonestar and watching tall skinny guys in tight pants play buck hunter with serious skill sometimes i will bust out the jenga and think about calling one of the numbers someone has scribbled on a blocki love this placeupdate i have tried their crap food specifically the frito pie with meat chili and the sloppy joes they were and respectively and just about what youd expect but in a good way also if you get into the chartreuse you are in for trouble if you want to do it ill join ya
valhalla is apparently the name of the hall from scandinavian mythology for slain heroes its also a pretty catchy name for one of nycs best beer snob bars on a rainy saturday with a couple of hours to kill i spent some time in a nearly empty valhalla and immediately took a liking to the place there were imported and craft beers on tap with of them being from belgium i opted for a karmeliet trippel and a corsendonk brown both of which were served in the proper type of glass as others mentioned a superhot but very knowledgeable female bartender was working that day two large tvs were showing a baseball game with the sound muted which was a nice touch for those of us who dont watch baseball and dont particularly care for the sound of yammering announcers talking about batting averages to cloud our enjoyment of snobby belgian ales in keeping with its rather classy atmosphere valhalla offers flights of beers something ive never seen before for a very reasonable price you get a selection of beers with a theme belgium around the world etcthe guy next to me ordered a budweisera budweiserthis is about like going to peter lugers and instead of ordering a steak asking for a nice can of spam or just asking if you could instead lick the floor of the kitchen with your tongue i think they should hire bouncers for such cretins
beef bacchanalmaybe it was the charred porterhouse with its marbled perfectionmaybe it was our waiter who clairvoyantly knew that wed be ordering steak for with spinach and potatoesmaybe it was the tea ceremonylike precision of movements that orchestrated everything from the exacting arrangement of plates and glasses to the serving of steakmaybe it was the overflowing glass of bourbon i washed it all down withmaybe it was the creamed spinach that i just wanted to bathe inormaybe it was the parmenidian constancy of it all and knowing that you could come back years from now and everything would still run with the same quality and precisionwhatever it is peter luger has it down to an art
gnocco is a well kept secret that i am going to share with my fellow yelpers it is a perfect spot to take a date because chances are they have never been here before everything from the food to service to ambience is top notch mind you it is not per se but it also doesnt have those prices either i really believe that people dont want to tell others about the place so it doesnt lose its charm it is plenty busy so there must be some talk i have been here times now and ordered a different thing each time they were all delicious i really dont think you can make a mistake with the menu the only food suggestion i will give is that you must order a pizza for an appetizer choose which one to your liking it definitely belongs in the top of pizzas in nyc and i dont type this lightly they do take reservations for parties larger than two if you are reading this seriously consider making it a destination for your weekend with friends or taking a date i hope you love it as much as i do ciao
i know what youre thinkingthe daily show but thats just a tv show that type of stuff doesnt get rated on yelp it violates all the yelp rulesaha i say but i went to a taping last night so in fact it is a local destinationafter much emailing and waiting a few months my confirmation email for daily show tickets finally came a couple weeks ago in a word hilarious so we got there at and the doors open at the line was already about people long at that point meaning that not everyone behind us got in so get there early or you might get bounced also its worth bringing a snack a book and a little folding stool because youre going to be standing for probably two hours and thats a long time to stand in one place i think its one of the grey areas in the new anti torture bill but once things start moving around probably it goes fast they usher you in with militaristic precision and then bring out the warm up comic he was far funnier than i expected and get ready because he will interact with you particularly if you are wearing a suit look shy are under the age of are outgoing or catch his eye in any way then jon stewart comes on takes some questions from the crowd and after that the show starts from then on you already know how it goes
how do you impress a girl on a first date the gramercy tavern now all other first dates will lack sorry boys we went through the entire wine list glass by glass tasting and swirling and discussing the beautiful alsacian white the bartenders were topnotch albeit a bit smug but i suppose i would be snug if i had that sort of bartending job too the food was divine the carrot and calamari salad was delicately tossed with an intriguing meyer lemon vinaigrette which smelled acidic with notes of wasabi the corn soup was a rich heavenly blend of sweet corn cream and oyster mushrooms topped with smoky bacon shavings this soup was so good i just want to bathe in it that goodfor our second course we had the fontina stuffed meatball over a potato puree which was great i wouldnt say it is the best meatball i have ever had but i think that is due in part to the recent new york city meatball craze of the pork chop was stunning this was one of the most flavorful pieces of meat i have eaten this year plump and forktender smoky succulent and without a doubt meaty this was plated on a warm zucchini and served with crisp haricot vert it was perfection ugh i am disgusted with how good this dish is men have you been taking notes are you properly equipped with and a lot of good jokes spare me of designer bags i will forgo all the nice clothes in the world for a fantastic night of drinking and eating such glorious food so the question remains will i go out on a second date with him well that unfortunately depends less on the food and more on the chemistry
anyone who knows me knows that of my waking hours is spent inside a public library its not that i read i do but not as much as my time spent in libraries would indicate its because im poor and cheap and i try to make up for it by feeding off of public resources as much as i can and really the nypl is a glorious system why would anyone rent a video from blockbuster when you can place it on hold and get it at the library for free in any case jefferson market is one of the more unique libraries among the nypl system its decked with stained glass windows has a very cool spiral staircase and houses quite a neat collection of materials having come here regularly now for about a year and a half ive picked up a few things for example the security lady does this thing the library opens at on most daysand usually around there will be a group of people waiting outside we have no social lives its true she will not open the doors until the clock chimes at this is observed strictly she will stand there and jingle her keys as if saying haha look at the power i hold over thee you lowly creatures with this smirk on her face ive gotten used to this by now and i usually show up around just for the show its quite amusing and shes actually really nice once you get to know her ive also become a regular here so if im mia for a week someone will inevitably say havent seen you in awhile this is not a good thing because once they get to know you they will want to talk to you and then all sorts of things can develop one time i was here and the guy says to me ah you have one item overduewould you like me to renew it me thinking i dont remember having anything overdue whats he talking about i give him a quizzical look it looks like you have alternatives to sex overdue alternatives to sex now i remember having realize what that title might imply it was actually a contemp fiction novel quite a good read my face immediately goes red but i try to play it cool oh right yes please do renew that then he says you also have items here on hold for you so he goes into the backroom and takes out whatever i have on hold as he scans out a dvd i placed on hold for a film study thing i notice that the cover for it is quite explicitly sexual how come i dont remember this cover when i placed a hold on it he does not look at me but by now probably thinks of me as extremely sexually repressed or some such odd thing but again i play it cool great thanks a lot i say with utter normality only to bump into a bookcase on the way out and dropping everything on the floor thus making a scene as i usually do and casting more unwanted attention to myself i have inadvertently made myself out to be the awkward girl here but in all seriousness i highly recommend this branch if you need some quiet time to studyreaddo nothing for an entire day there are plenty of comfy tables and chairs

i want to sleep with the fishes mainly so i can turn over in the middle of the night and take a big bite out of themmy time here last night was superb food was excellent wine was perfectly paired and the atmosphere was lively oooohhh and i tried a third of the menu always a plus and lemme just say to the fishes harmed in the making of my meal be proud be honored because you my little fishy friends are part of something special something that other fish can only dream offor starters or as the crave people like to say what you order before your order i tried the spicy yellow fin tuna set on top of planched seared yucca with a lime butter ceviche man that was good tender tuna creamy yucca you really just have to try it i also tried the traditional shrimp ceviche with charred corn and hearts of palm in a cilantro and fresh lime ceviche well of course that was just excellent and when they say charred corn they actually mean ancho spiced popcorn as my friend put it i had to get the traditional ceviche it comes with popcorn well said they also had oysters on special in a tomato and young ginger sauce didnt actually taste one but my fellow eaters eyes rolled into the back of her head i think thats a good signentrees came next i had the artic char with truffles i totally just said truffles strawberries and caviar in a champagne and sea salt ceviche it sounds interesting doesnt it i was a bit skeptical but i had to try it champagne and truffles you might as well offer me some crack with my meal it was amazing i mean really amazing as ron burgundy would say by the beard of zeus it was that good also got to try the kona kampachi with curried chickpeas cucumber and green mango in a mint yogurt and fresh lemon ceviche also very tasty i may have had some trouble spearing the chickpeas with my fork but thats just because im slightly retarded when im hungryalso tried the pupusa with spicy florida red snapper slaw with naam pla lime juice and kalamanzi ceviche im not usually a fan of snapper but it was quite good in this dish really it was the perfect summery dish a heaping mound of citrusy cole slaw over flat breadmy friend also had the filet mignon slider with manchego cheese house made sour cream and chive potato chips in a worcestershire sauce and lemon juice ceviche there was more eye rolling i had a chip it was tastywe only tried one of their sides the grilled red corn with queso blanco well i had it and i didnt share its not that im selfish its just that its well corn on the cob really not easy to share with others and to be honest i dont think i couldve shared it i love cheese on my corn and when theres a sizeable layer covering the corn and it tastes like heaven im just lucky i dont eat the cob itselfto drink i had the las brisas wine and it was described well on the menu peachy and floral by the second carafe i may not have noticed the peach as much but again a personal issue having to do with lack of self control others had the white sangria which looked refreshing and delicious unfortunately they dont serve cocktails but i think you can get pretty toasty despite their lack of a liquor licenseour waiter had a touch of the add but to be fair there were a lot of shiny things in the place and when he could bring himself back to paying attention to us he was quite funny i learned that the filet mignon slider is much better than white castle sliders that the kampachi is flown in from hawaii every day but that it does not fly itself people do that and that my crewneck sweater was indeed too provocative all excellent insightsthe space is a bit cramped theres really only room for maybe people in the whole place and out of those only about can sit at a table the rest are relegated to sitting at the bar which is arranged similar to a sushi bar i thought it was quaint but i definitely wouldnt suggest taking a large number of people here and its quite expensive all that stuff i listed up there that was for of us mmm hmm im not even going to tell you how much i paid all i will say is that it was worth itso we get the bill right and guess what comes with it free dessert this amazing frozen spicy chocolate something ice cream mebbe with flavors of caramel mixed in unfreakingbelievable i can see why they put it in such a small bowl otherwise it might have ended up in my hair as i put the spoon down and ate it old skool trough styleto sum great place creative yummy food free dessert
this place definitely deflated my head a little bit afterall how could there be such an undiscovered gem a block from my abode and i not know about it this place is hidden in the basement next to the always crowded sapporo ramen joint right when i walked in i knew it had all the right callings for fantastic japanese dining its in a basement it was packed it was full of japanese people i dont mean for this to sound unpc and im sorry if it does but im just inferring this from my own mindset as a chinese person since you better believe ive got a tight quality control system going for my chinese food but i digresswe walked in and sat at the corner of the bar which was awesome cuz i felt even more authentic and additionally it gave me a good view of everyone elses food the food included tapalike dishes such as daikon salad with calamari or anchovies tartar and sushisashimi specials selected yakitori and larger entrees like udon fried rice hotpots and garlicbutter stirfries my favorite is the pork belly hot pot mmmmmmmmmmm though it is a little on the saltier sideall this can be washed down with good sake glass or box cocktail flavored soju and beer not necessarily all at once the service here is attentive though they do get busy during prime dinner hours there may be a wait between especially if you have a larger group otherwise this is also a great place for singleton dining all in all its a fantastic find and the price tag is reasonable i ended up leaving here with a tummy full of food and leftovers to go and a warm fuzzy feeling from all the sakes ahh how i miss that feeling now sitting alone in my cubenot true for my tummy
in the ongoing hunt for the perfect falafel in nyc cafe rakka makes the short list the catalyst for me joining yelp was to defy the recent spate of reviews this place has received most recently my own sister trashed them i blame her flawed perception on the drugsto be fair i havent been in a while but it used to be that no matter where i was in the city cafe rakka was worth the travel time rakka was a standby place to bring a girl for a getting to know you inexpensive city date bad falafel does not get you laid and this place came through for meon one such outing with a girl to cafe rakka we ordered falafel sandwiches she replied no thank you to the gruff hot sauce of course i told the guy i wanted hot sauce on mine he stops stuffing the pitas looks me in the eye and says i know your sandwich my date looked at me like a celebrity cafe rakka knows my goddamn sandwichon to the food the falafel is not always the same it varies depending on who makes it you can make requests toast the pita slightly on the grill let the balls get a little crispier etc since these are usually made to order unlike a production line like mamouns where they practically hand you a falafel as you walk in the door and move you alongthe salad and tomatoes are fresh and the falafel balls are crispy and well spiced the optional hot sauce as always is essential unlike anywhere else ive been they mix the hot sauce in with the strata of ingredients so you dont get all the hot bites at the top as with any good wellsauced falafel you will want to slowly peel back the wrapper as you are eating so as to avoid getting tahini on the crotch of your pants tahini crotch invariably makes you look like a sex criminalduring busy hours out on the counter they used to leave a free plate of deep fried skinny pita bread slices they are spiced with sumac a tangy powder made of dried crushed deep red berries you can order it from the menu pita bread sticks for like and you get enough to share these are a great accompaniment to a falafel sandwich and are better than any fries you have had especially when they come out of the frier all crispy and almost burning youa side of fava bean salad is also good especially if you ask them to drizzle a little tahini on it their hummus is good and has a strong taste of cumin i add cumin to store bought hummus now
indulge me if you will for a story a story of fatnessmy roommate and i used to have a tradition called fat sunday in which every sunday night wed order obscene amounts of chinese takeout and watch desperate housewives and greys anatomy back when they were on at the same timesighoh the memories one night we had some people joining us and we decided to switch up the fatness and order something different in our huge stack of takeout menus we found empanada mama and thought hey why notnow there werent all that many of us maybe but we ordered a lot of empanadas i mean a lot so many that we decided when the delivery guy arrived we would yell something like hey guys the foods here back to imaginary people in our bedrooms so that he wouldnt think we were total fatasses for ordering something like empanadas for people yup thats per person we call it fat sunday for a reason people but heres the rub and the fat we ordered so many so that we could try as many flavors as possible and of course to be as fat as possible but they left out one flavor leaving us four empanadas short we paused clearly we had plenty of empanadas this loss put us down to what but we had paid for all of them and wanted to try all the flavors should we admit true obesity and call back and demand yet more empanadas yes damn it its fat sunday so we did and they obliged promptly and were they delicious hot cheap and ohsofat you betcha a great little place to stop for some fried latino goodness and not do any damage to your wallet unfortunately i cant say the same for your waistline

ahhh there is nothing like torturing your body like swimming biking and running all in the same day i just finished my second nyc triathlon and living in san francisco this has become my destination triathlon each year my wife who doesnt compete also wins by spending the whole week in nyc seeing museums and shopping the distances olympic distance tri mile swim miles biking miles runningthe swim a point to point swim in the hudson river doesnt sound appealing at first but the river isnt that bad the swift currents makes anyone a fast swimmer so your mile prs personal record are easy to achieve the only problem is the last meters the waters are shallow and the river bottom is kind of tarry so it is suggested to try to swim all the way if youre a bad swimmer just let the currents take you downstreamthe bike a mile trek up the west coast hwy with appox feet of total climbing its a fun rolling course with river views and downhill straightaways the last turnaround you get a view of the nyc skyline the run the first mile you have street all to yourself and the run is very surreal people line the streets to cheer you on the course then takes you to central park and you run a big loop around central park its very cool to finish the race thereonce you finish the racers are treated like vip kings free food drinks tee shirts caps wet ice cold towels and a medal there is even a tent with swedish masseuses students who give mins free massages the race is very organized and professional its neat to see some of the world class athletes racing with you it is timed using a computer chip so loved ones can receive text messages of your progress there is even a second video of yourself that gets sent to you at the finish linethe bad nyc can be hot and humid during july so the racing conditions can be hard i cramped up both years during the run portion but i did finishall and all an enjoyable event which i plan to do each year gives my wife and i an excuse to visit nyc
i was dressed literally in a dress ready for a lovely night with kurt s when thunder within minutes i learned of various blackouts in the city con edison mother nature had conspired to ruin my evening of cocktails at the us preview of blancpains new fifty fathomsso im sitting at home writing a review about the boutique insteadim certain russ w is not shedding any tears for meblancpain is the watch for those serious about their timepieces the company was created in has vowed never to manufacture a quartz watch never this fact alone should compel connoisseurs to be brand loyal you must admire a company that stands solidly behind its ethics during my last visit to the store i was interested in the villeret specifically the minute repeater slim refined perfect i wanted to see a few other options nicole sarault pleasantly offered assistance the space is cozy perhaps the size of a large office or a small conference room the decor is tasteful relatively sparse the better to showcase the beauty of the timepieces note to kurt raincheck pun intended

choir of angelsahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhits here on little tiny jones street the best damn meal you have had in ages served without pomp circumstance or pretense in clean simple unfussy surroundings i know how hard should it be to find seasonal american fare that doesnt require the sale of a kidney or come with a side order of supercilious not hard at all now that harold dieterle and his crack team of sincere foodloving staff are ensconced in this gem of a restaurant where to begin well look i watched top chef and i was a huge harold fan his food always looked like food i wanted to make and eat myself the restaurant delivers exactly the kind of food you would expect him to create genuine wellprepared creative and traditional all at the same time looking forward to coming here tonight was a wonderful anticipation and for once the reality exceeded my expectations we began with a drink at the comfortable bar we had reservations for but we got there early to relax the bartender i cant remember her name was it erin recommended several wines to me allowed me to try them all and then jamie the maitred came by to offer her suggestion jamie lives in our building so i took her seriously since if she made a bad choice for us i would give her what for in the elevator i went with a lovely tempranillo because i wanted to have lamb a museum real from spain well priced at a glass silky velvety and richly fruity it was a wonderful start to the evening peter had a lagavulin which was quite overpriced at when seated we listened to our server and jamie while deciding we had read all the reviews including the times review which they were all somewhat disappointed with and we both had items we wanted to try i began with the berkshire pork belly and peter had the duck meatballs served with a quail egg we didnt think the meatballs were that memorable but they were tasty the pork belly was an enormous cloud of meaty fat perched upon mushrooms and braised greens which cut the overwhelming richness of the belly which was enhanced by a vanilla gastrique which was very nicely done and understated the portion was so large and the belly was so porky and rich that i was unable to finish which was sadfor main dishes peter ordered the skate wing with pastrami and cabbage i think and i got the colorado lamb chops and breast served with parsely root mousseline and cippolini onions the skate was easily one of the best most imaginative and yet traditional dishes i have had in recent memory the pastrami enhanced the delicate skate and the cabbage supported the unusual texture in the most remarkable waysi cant say enough about it and the portion was enormous my lamb was perfectly cooked with the breast meat richly shredded in the greens of my dish and the onions providing a savoryslightly sweet accompaniment to the gamy lamb the only letdown was the parsely root mousseline which really did nothing at all for the dish due to the nonexistent taste i was disappointed that it didnt work because i think it was a good idea we also ordered a side of faro risotto this had to be one of the best dishes i have ever had faro is like a wheat berrychewy dense nutty and a wonderful texture when chewed this risotto was simply divine artichokes soft as puppy ears dotted this garlicky creamy parmegiany pot of savory goodness its topped with some grapes which we ignored since we dont like sweet with savoryservice was friendly eager warm and genuine bread was whole grain and delicious served with a green fruity grassy olive oil and a tiny wooden ramekin of salt water came with reckless abandon and plentitude the bathrooms were cute albeit small the manager strode up and down the narrow restaurant constantly asking whether everything was to our liking asking if i needed more wine folding napkins and overseeing a very wellrun dining room the hum of satsified diners and the wellchosen music provide enough noise to be animated but you wont find yourself straining to hear your companionwe were simply too full to have dessert but they looked and sounded lovely harold was too busy to come out and say hi but given the care and effort laid bare on every plate i was happy to hear it this is a wonderful place to come for a nice evening meal on a regular basis if you live nearby and it is good enough and refreshingly honest enough to make a point to come here even if you live out of town there were several families with kids there when we visited and for nice wellbehaved kids this is a great place because the food isnt weird or overly presented note i said nice kids dont bring a screamer here please the prices are a hair under what you would expect them to be and the food is quite delicious well done
i love this place tons of reviews already so ill just give a list of pros and cons yes there are some despite my star rating their good stuff is that good kitchen is open late i thick juicy and cooked to order most places overcook their burgers but dumont will serve up yours exactly as requested and their bun wont get all soggy and fall apart in your hands not that theres anything wrong with licking your fingers clean i just dislike soggy mini size for those with undersized stomachs or for those gluttons who want a burger with their mac and mac cheese amazingly rich plenty of gruyere cheese and bacon and perfectly browned on top a must i think the place holds a total of people so at peak times expect to wait a long time delivery takes a while mins hour at peak times pickup is a good option the onion rings batter is too bready and theres too much of it fries are better but occasionally salad alternative to fries and onion rings is a little uninspired some mixed greens and dressing no other veggies mixed in for texture or anything could do stay away from the potato leek soup was like eating heavy cream
generally i dont bother to write reviews for places that have been reviewed this many times already because usually i dont have much to say that hasnt been said before but on this occasion i have a few items to point i dont understand why everyone is complaining that this museum is so difficult to navigate its really not i promise you admittedly ive been going to the brooklyn museum for my entire life but any art museum as full as this one is going to be a bit overwhelming on your first visit do you really think the met is any easier to navigate when youre there for the first the brooklyn museum is as far as i know the only museum that has visible storage facilities which are amazing you can find them on the top floor off of the permanent collection the museums renovations a few years ago were not limited to the entrance and they added this visible storage facility because such a small portion of any museums collection is ever on display at one time its a climatecontrolled room filled with glass cases and densely packed in those cases is so much artwork paintings sculpture furniture pewter pieces theres even a bicycle there are also computers throughout the room so you can look up more information on a piece you like using its catalog number because the cases are so full that there isnt even room for labels identifying each let us not forget the battle with giuliani in when the brooklyn museum a hosted the sensations exhibit despite the controversy that came with it it was called sensations for a reason and b continued to host the exhibit even when people protested and giuliani threatened to take away the museums city funding they held strong in the name of art and freedom of speech and i will always admire them for it
there are plenty of reviews that have been written canonizing this pizza and a few that provide the inevitable backlashcontrarian view to combat all the hype this review aims to use the elements of the di fara experience as ingredients towards a larger contemplation of mans quest for perfection consider it an homage to doms attempt to honor his fantastic ingredients via his pizzamakingexcept with infinitely more pretentiousness extra cheese and infinitely less virtuosity canned saucewhat is the price of perfection i ponder during my long wait for receiving one mans a spry near septuagenarian dom demarco attempt at creating perfection within an edible inch circle of tomato cheeses and dough now this isnt my initial thought mind you i entered with my heart athumpin as i finally found myself at the oftproclaimed best pizzeria in new york my initial thoughts vacillate between an internal loop of im gonna have di fara pizza that resembles both eddie murphys old i have some ice cream standup bit and commercial pleadings of cartoon dogs for snausages and kibbles concern over whether the wait will drive the rest of my family crazy my cousin had a party about miles away and after hearing how excited i was about the pizza my mom dad sisters and sisters fiancee decide to join me in the experiencethese pragmatic concerns are taken care of by the key decision after minutes of waiting to take slices for each of us in lieu of our first pie i had ordered a pie to go the slice was great but too complex to make any grand assessment of it im left longing for another slice as i bid adieu to my family who head back to the land of malls and hair spray njas i wait for my pie to go i start to take in my surroundings theres nothing fancy or romantic about the place the only thing distinguishing it vs other northeastern pizza joints are the various framed articles touting di fara not that other pizza places dont toot their own horn if i had a nickel for every pizza box ive seen with the youve tried the rest now try the best line at least di fara employs thirdparty assessments but this place is different in two key there isnt a doughslinger or chef behind the counter theres an artisan you can tell it in the way dom grates the buffalo mozzarella onto each pie vs having the bucket of grated mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on or the way he chops basil and grates another type of cheese grana padana to top off the finished pie as classical music plays in the background there isnt a line of customers waiting for a pie or some slices there is chaos perhaps due to naivete i pictured the wait for a di fara pie to be a communal experience people bonded together for one common objective sharing a mutual respectyadda yadda yadda but im not seeing a lot of that whatever positive motivations everyone brought to the pizzeria have all but disappeared thanks to the long wait and the infuriating lack of an equitable ordering system and its this yinyang battle separated by a pizza counter that gets me thinking about the price of perfection watching dom apply his craft is a treat and i can only hope he finds inner peace and tranquility in it but the desperation conflict and opportunism people try and often succeed at getting their pie before others on the other side of the counter feel like a microcosm of other quests for perfection blood diamonds perfect jewel ethnic cleansing perfect race enron perfect scam steroids perfect male body eating disorders perfect female body the unnecessary zaniness that balky inflicted on cousin larry perfect strangers etc is the quest for perfection even one much more noble than all the above examples ever worth the costafter probably minutes of such philosophizing on top of the earlier minutes i finally get my pie and can find out whether the pizza truly is worth it the first slice is fantastic the interplay of the two cheeses has such a sharp rich taste to it the san marzano tomatoes taste so rustic and earthy the basil complements both the cheese and tomatoes the crust has a great char to it its like no slice ive had before another slice confirms the assessment this could very well be the best pizza ive ever hadbut im still not totally satisfied i dont know if it was the hype the wait selfinflicted nihilism or a bit of all three but this odyssey didnt end up being about a search for the best pizza it became about a search for the perfect pizza and perfection is too much to ask of anyone even dom

alice is some kind of irish hair cutting goddess let me tell you the fact that im giving the place a star review after waiting for over an hour i was a little early but still is incredible if you cant tell from my other reviews im generally not the most patient person nor am i very high maintenance ill run a hair straightener over my hair when im trying to look presentable because otherwise i look like the woman in the dilbert comics with the triangle shaped mass of frizzy curliness on her head but generally i spend about minutes on my hair alice singlehandedly transformed the amorphous blob of fuzz on my head to a silky bob im getting a headache from tossing my head around i cant help iti highly reccomend this place your appointment may end up getting bumped to later probably not i think its just because she was teaching stuff but be patient its worth the wait also off as a first time customer including tip for a cut and a blow dry ive paid less but ive definitely paid more for less when it comes to your hair its worth the extra couple dollars to get something really special

only god knows how i managed to not write a review of this place despite having been there times already and it is my dying meal i dont even know where to beginas you may know my favorites are the fried rice and the scallionseafood pancake i also love the chicken dish that javier always gets i had the sweet potato tempura and some other rice dish which i ordered by mistake the last time i was there but no worries gama you still get a perfect score from methe first time ms joey led us there after hookah on that fateful night me and her proceeded to drink the best li teas ever hence our current rule no l i teas for you young lady then javier and i stood and watched well he talked i gazed as the owner ladled out cups of watermelon soju for us and now we get a pitcher or two every time we go there god help whoever is stupid enough to leave theirs behind for a second because much like julie at sakagura i go to work when no one else is lookingreally i crave that stuff in the middle of the night sometimesthe place is really lovely with cool pictures all over the place some drawn by the owners kids which i think is a really sweet touch the bar in front is really cool and the people there are nice and not afraid to make conversation the back is very spacious and can accommodate large parties they also have a couple of long tables outside in front of the restaurantthe owner is a good soul who is always around i think the coolest thing that he told us on that night was that he wanted to take his kids to costa rica to learn how to surf that touched my heart
yumneed i say more okay well i will i thought that some things just shouldnt be screwed or funkafied aka traditional rice pudding vanilla ice cream chocolate macarons purity is always better right i know im yawn so boringwell in the case of rice pudding no funkafied flavors bring them on i tried i know not too daring cinnamon raisin traditional and pecan pie i must say i was quite no quite pleased with all three the traditional was by far the best however the other two still amazing i loved them all and the literature easy humor but still made me smile and laugh in some casesyum yum yum thankfully this is not near where i live or id have to start running marathons weekly to compensate for my rice pudding caloric intake
this is the most authentic little dumpling shop in chinatown the place looks as if it could exist in the same way it does in is made on the spot with a giant table covered in flour and dough and little grandmas kneading away five pork dumplings for four pork buns for soy milk hot and sour soup and a few other traditional items exist on a short and sweet menu for i walked away with dumplings a container of soy milk and the biggest goofiest grin on my face there is no reason to ever be hungry in this city

im actually trying to think of what to say about this place but everything im thinking about is a little too risque in a fabulous way like the other reviewer said its great that there are no skeevie guys leering at you and that if you mention to your friends you went there on an errand they look at you with envy rather than pity the experience is highly entertaining and very practical bring a friend who has a good sense of humor i hear that they offer classes on variousthingsum anyway go
yelpers did not let me down again took pam out for a date today read a lot about this place thought i would give it a try this place is really a hole in the wall approaching this place on eldrige of the street is either closed or available for rent and i am thinking yeah right this place is busy got across the street to this place and it looked like as if there were a hundred people cramped up in this place which barely was feet wide by feet entering this place took me back to my days in high school in india where we had to literally push shove to get your order through total chaos here i figured i better order more than what we can eat cause there was not going to be another order this place was packed cramped i ordered vegi dumpling pork dumplings pancake with beef chicken corn soup home made hot sauce in sriracha hot sauce bottlepriceless the thought of jacking the hot sauce bottle ran across my mind every time i dipped the dumpling in it i would buy that hot sauce bottle for more than how much i payed for that meal which was only we ate in the back and enjoyed every bite of the meal we preferred the pork dumpling over the vegi the soup was ok the pancake was awesome if you like fried stuff although i did not realize it was fried till i ordered another one on my way out and was told it was a minute wait i highly recommend this place and will take guri here when he comes here in march it is cash only and shy people better speak up to order or you will just watch folks come later than you and leave before youheads up especially to the vegi folks they boil the vegi dumplings and the pork dumplings in the same large cooking vessel

good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome to jean georges if i may guide you all through our extensive menu options we have the prefixe dinner menu the seasonal menu and the jean georges menu that has remained unchanged for hundreds of years our specials tonight include a smooth silkywith foam truffles flown in just today that i highly highly recommend in two distinctones an airysucculent feel melange of flavorsexplodingthe other nuanced aroma please let me know if i can be of further assistance i hope you will have a great timeas the server left our table with that enthusiastic introduction the six of us sat dumbfounded staring quietly at the menus in front of usas i hold back the saliva and imagine that the rest are also going through the same state of inner turmoil i blurt out ok what the hell happened just now were the definitive foodies weve been to bouley boulud etc why am i feeling like a complete fool right now why cant i think straight i couldnt even listen properly to what he was sayingto which a friend responds you know for the life of me i cant figure out i need a pen to mark through the options on the menu and then select through a process of elimination looking at these options and food descriptions and with his words still ringing in my ears i just cant think straighti respond ok so we must let the left brain take over now lets start reading aloud what these options are and what they could be like as we start hearing our own voices things may become clearerthats the magic of jean georges people talk about food that appeals to all five senses jean georges actually delivers that experience from the intense aromas i still remember the truffleooh ive never remembered a nondessert food item like i remember their truffle to the passionate description of the dish from the nuances of the arctic char to the textures of the egg caviar the explosive scent intensity of the various broth items to the smoky froth that lightens the foie gras theres no blending in but flourishes big and small that all vie to grab your attentionin case you chose not to go with tradition the centuries old menu i strongly recommend to go with the servers recommendations also the sommelier is extremely knowledgeable and made an excellent suggestion on a chateauneufdupape reserve from rhoneas we got to my favorite part of the meal i looked at the available options which amounted to dessertwithinadessert one could go with a theme chocolate citrus late harvest and winter and in that theme one would get different desserts obviously chocolate intrigued me molten chocolate cake with vanilla bean granite coffeecardamom meringue milk chocolate peanut cake with salted caramel ice cream white chocolate with mint yuzu and pink peppered sable but hold on theres a problem i dont eat white chocolate period so i request if i may replace that with another chocolate option in the citrus category surprisingly the server says that it cannot be done however i am in no mood to take no for an answer i beckon him and inquire have you heard the cinderella story he responds somewhat bemused yes sir me so you obviously know about cinderella her plain looking step sisters and the ugly wicked witch he excuse me sir but theres no wicked witch in cinderella just a fairy godmother you are mixing up cinderella with snow white me precisely if dark chocolate is cinderella and milk chocolate is the plain step sister then white chocolate is the witch that has nothing to do with the story so you see my point is white chocolate isnt chocolate he by now smiling broadly thats persuasive enough for me sir ill see what i can do though for a moment i was wondering about the potency of those rhone valley grapesat least thats how i remember the storyfor he did end up substituting the white chocolate dessert but i must confess all of the desserts were extremely complex versions and full marks to the pastry chefat this a friend marveled at my passion for dessert despite the extravagant meal so i shared my philosophy on desserts in easily understood terms and seek your indulgence for the same the process of pleasure is similar to that in sex you have to get in the mood by talking about it anticipation creates the excitement it is important in its own right as opposed to compensating for a bad day at work one must build up appropriately as opposed to immediate gratification as a sugar fix you need to relax and savor the complete experience and the only thing which should make you feel guilty is if you give of yourself fully on the first date unless of course its true love
spaceship discovery one thats all i could think of when i walked into the bar at maru after a scary ride in the dingy elevator that takes you there little did i expect to find a beautiful place like this one the decor is modern and sophisticated with white leather couches and dim neon lighting alleys of pebble stones on the floor and a mens room vaguely reminiscent of a teleporter booth i was there with yelptastic joolie t maritess z audrey j maria m and javier m and we got one of the karaoke room combos for private room until closing bottle of grey goose with unlimited mixers beer and fruit platter a little pricey but not too bad a deal considering the crazy fun we had in there the room was pretty nice but they need to revert those oneway mirrors people outside can see you but you cant see them so strange soon enough the disco lights were on and we were all rocking to korean pop grease and madonna i wish i could remember more of what we sang i guess the grey goose did its job what i do remember though is putting on a dance show with maritess that would have made britney blush i had no voice when we finally left at
there is nothing i dont love about this store their wares are awesome they have a platform above this wind thing so you can try on a cape and have it blowing in a superheroesque fashion they make you recite a superheros pledge when you purchase something and theyre primarily there to support a writing program for kids simply awesome in every way this has actually become one of my favorite places to take outoftown guests or even manhattanites who are visiting me in brooklyn because its so unique and its a lot of fun to wander around the store
if it means i can comfortably enjoy a film by avoiding the stereotypical gaggle of obnoxious teenagers who frequent the larger movie houses think amc on st then i wholeheartedly embrace the higher ticket prices and relative geographic obscurity offered by the most nyc film houses fail miserably in the charm department creating stuffy impersonal atmospheres that cater to a raucous clientele who would rather spend two hours hurling a litany of obscenities at a screen than actually watching a film if movie chain giants like amc and sony are alarmed by the home theater revolution spearheaded by netflix and other dvd rental services they should be most people are quite tired of shelling out top dollar for a movie ticket only to endure the misogynistic humor stylings of some year old who just snuck into the theater eventually i grew weary of waiting for films to come out on dvd just so i could avoid being trapped in a darkroom with a throng of unruly squirming puberty pirates time to take back the theaters my friends but where to go shone like a beacon in the vast dark terrain of movie going mayhemdespite being located in close proximity to ground zero has managed to survive in area that saw so many businesses financially decimated in the wake of the tragedy when i started noticing a large number of tourists congregating at the wtc site to make a morbid postmortem examination of a neighborhood in mourning i decided to take a break from visiting the area i found when i couldnt obtain ducats to some overproduced blockbuster that was selling out everywhere else i didnt wait on line for very long and with some time to kill i decided to check out some of noncinematic offerings such as the restaurants and hotel situated in the complex i cant remember off hand the exact names of the restaurants but i was taken aback by their presence in a cineplex nonetheless and the hotel wow you could go to bed right after the movie if you made reservations the theater itself at least the one i was in was quite impressive cushy seats with a reclining feature and enough legroom so your knees wont be crushed if the person in front of you leans back best of all my fellow moviegoers conducted themselves in a civilized manner not one cell phone went off cant ask for more than that you can start a great night at the movies with a detour to nearby kitchenette for some homestyle cookin by homestyle i mean a nice country home in iowa not my home we be eatin ramen twentyfo seven up in thurr homes
i never thought id review a lawyer i was hoping id never have to but after years of having a leaking roof which has collapsed twice ruined my floors and furniture left me sleepless listening to water and wind rush into my apartment at all hours and leaving an unforgiving foot hole in your ceiling euphemism skylight when your apartment is only feet long to begin with and when this hole eats your your summer attempts at airconditioning your winter attempts at heating grows allergenic and toxic moldand no one is doing anything well yeah you get my point and it is amazing how hard it is to find a coop lawyer so i finally gave up and i went to edward braverman on the rec of a friend edward braverman is the antithesis of that subwayad buying ambulance chasing stereotype you may have in your head hes kind caring efficient and brilliant he got me relocated while they fixed my apartment and wouldnt let my management company house me in an unsafe neighborhood or do a crappy job in my apartment so here is my big yelp for mr braverman i hope you never need him but if you do i highly recommend him
this is an excellent steak house that has never once seated me on time be advised that even if youre on time the hostess will chant tables are leaving just a few more minutes for about minutesthe steaks here are why i stopped being a whiny pasty vegetarian in canvas shoes they have one of the hottest broilers in the city so the steak is marvelously seared on the outside their seasoning is simple and stellar you dont need steak sauce in fact i curse your steak sauce usagethe appetizers are good but overpriced we no longer bother with them bread basket appetizers entree and sides too much food unless youre morbidly obesespeaking of sides excellent our usuals are creamed spinach with truffle oil and the deliciously unhealthy goose fat potatoes get em before our libertyrestricting intrusive city council bans emnever once made it to dessert the dessert portions could feed a small nations sweet toothservice is usually quite good great wine list killer atmosphere tight quarters moderately noisy theyre on opentable which makes reserving a table easy but if youre seated on time itd be a frickin miracle
i love times square i cannot tell a lie i find some kind of zen happiness while walking through times square especially when im down in the subway stationi think this love comes from being in the epicenter of manhattan im not going to say that the tourists dont get on my nerves but i feel like this is where i can use my crowd dodging acumen and what new yorker doesnt pride themselves in thatbut my favorite thing is getting off of a train and walking through the central area of the station during rush hour and not bumping into anyone i dont think new yorkers really bump into each other unless there are extenuating circumstances so even though the times square station is packed with moving bodies they manage to avoid each other in an elaborate bizarrelydistantyetincrediblyaware dance of movementi love it
nestled between the banal grayness of east street there is a red door painted with gold olde english lettering beckoning the weary broke traveler to his her temporary home from the outside you would expect a dumpy mildewridden hostel but upon opening the door you will feel as though you have entered a ws burroughsesque dreamworld induced by lsd and a magic mushroom omeletthe people who work here make you feel less cool than a bar in billyburg i am convinced they have the greatest job in the world they sit in wonderland and come up with rock songs on guitars they schlepped over from their loft in a neighborhood in brooklyn that has not become conventionally cool yet thats how cool they are they are on the edge plus theyre hotbut on to the real catcher each room is a take on the theme of the floor ranging from some sort of safari outer space ancient egypt and hallucinogenic drugs my friend stayed on the safari floor his room contained a mural of pandasthese pandas were boninga cigarsmoking donkey watched from the other wall if i havent convinced you to check it out yet then i am a complete failure

an ode to west harlem pizzajust wanted to expand on lindsays review the reason theres no listing for this place is because its not listed under pauls pizza but under the name of the greek owner i just made the update to yelphistory lesson this pizzeria has been around for years its original location used to be the northeast corner of st and broadway where mcdonalds now stands this place used to be the epicenter of pizza in west harlem back in the day the setup they had is not much different than what youll find now it was a long counter from one end of the place to the other and tables with small revolving stools what was so cool is that all the ccny students would end up eating here as it was on the way to the train station it was an awesome corner to people watch my buelita used to take me here to eat almost everyday god today has become all about my grandma its been owned by the same greek family for all those years by extension they became honorary dominicans their spanish is ridiculously on point this was the type of place where youd have those diner characters there was the harmless but crazy old greek guy that would sit in the corner drinking coffee all day and talkng to himself yet he would mop the store down at the end of the day you had the oldschool dominican drug capos that wore nothing but pierre cardin shoes oscar de la renta slacks and guayabera shirts with the obligatory old spice smell emanating from them you also had new dominican arrivals being introduced to their first slice of new york pizza about years ago there was a massive fire that destroyed most of the building the place closed down and in about a year opened up at the current location same folksthis is by far the best pizza i have ever tasted in new york its nofrills here i mean they even have the same stools from the very barebones but the family that owns it are the best case in point the other day my brother i got the craving and walked over we wanted a fresh tomatoe pizza just so happens thats not on the menu but the lady said get some tomatoes from the store and ill them on for you i went to the bodega next door and bought two big tomatoes she sliced em and diced em and put em on the pizza i have never tasted such a juicy and satisfying pizza and ive been buying from them since i was thing that sucksno delivery i have always moaned about it to them they dont seem to be budging anytime soonlol the good pizza compensates for it i still gave them stars
whats old is also new again with this american bistro this experience was phenomenal from making reservations to the last goodbye as we walked out the doorthe name comes from christina rossettis nineteenthcentury poem goblin market where hideous little men hawk their wares to the ruin of young women this could indeed ruin the new york restaurant experience for you as its just head and shoulders above most moderately priced locales so nice so caring is the service that they make you feel like old friends coming over for dinner and the space charming and quaint with a true old school vibewhile at goblin market try a bottle of the tempernillo one of the many fantastic suggestions from our server for apps go for the shrimp risotto or chicken pot pie for dinner i would suggest opting for the bass or the misoglazed steak actually the pork tenderloin is dreamy as well dessert its all about the warm cookie plate or chocolate torte with mint chocolate chip ice cream
ayiyiyiyiyiyii just wanted to type thatbeen here twice perfect for a nice occasion because it may make a slight dent in your wallet you can walk in around ish and not need a reservation maybe more plausible for groups of or less otherwise call ahead medium sized dimlylit atrium bar leads to large dining room in the back there is ushaped booth style seating along one wall great for groups of ish this is definitely not a casual dining place but not a cocktail dress night either be safe and wear dress pants or i keeel you jk first eyeopener is the bread basket i realized later its the same bread thats served at lucys latin kitchen in union sq except lucys has some unwritten policy of one bread per guest whereas here you get a basket bonanza great unusual dipping sauce i dont know what the heck is in it but its a light happyfeeling sauce i recommend appetizers chicharron a crispy calamari and the empanadas has great lobster fillingceviches mariscos ohh yeah lobster and shrimp conchitas scallops all with great complimentary sides all has the slightly sour taste but thats how they all normally taste mmentrees all to ish i love the vaca frita al caballo this is where steak is done right holy cow literally i had the cordero once which is braised lamb shank ehh was not that impressed it has that applebees fajitas style serving u make your own little burritos or whatever but it was just a lot of work i dont like to work when i eat cutting steak is as far as it goes but i think it came with a moletype sauce smokey black bean type sauce and im not a fan of moles on people or on my lamb jkmy friend had the chuleta pork chop which was pretty damn good i tried it when she wasnt looking i think you have the option of making it spicy too all entrees come with sides i think its sad when some places dont have sides to accompany the main dish or maybe i just get greedy was way too full to try the desserts which i somewhat regret waitstaff is great nothing to complain about friendly attentive place has high ceilings nice airy feeling oh and have a mojito one of the better mojitos ive ever tasted i could swear they leave a sugar cane stick in it too and if you dont know how to enjoy sugarcane you just bite and suck it rawr dont bite anything off haha but bite and suck enjoy
i know i said my review would be of the ktown place last night i promise itll be special but i couldnt resist reviewing new york magazine one of my favorites especially after i saw diana bs shortandsyrupy sweet reviewtopical and materialistic yes in many ways and on most pages i mean the magazine not yelp from the ads for searle and vuitton to the strategist section to the real estate section at the back but hey new york caters to the wealthy i always say so a magazine bearing the citys name must accurately reflect the city dont you think i think time out ny that doesnt reflect new york that reflects williamsburg but there is no other magazine that i know of anyway that examines new york politics and stories like ny mag does and thats why i love it so it is really a covertocover read the arts section is another reason to love it i like the listing of sales that comes right after the strategist and the restaurant section is really thorough whenever i have used the section to pick a place for brunch or dinner the recommendation is spot on and everyone goes away happy last but not least i love the crosswords by maura jacobsen they are my favorites because they are somewhat easy yet i always feel mighty special when i actually finish one and some of my friends think im hot shit for doing them at all i do so like to daydream about lottery winnings and how much house they would buy so i peruse the real estate section often it also makes me happy that new york magazine only dedicates one page to social events and not the last or so like ocean drive ugh although ny mag has the matrix but i find that really interesting and funny and i hear myself say things like i know righti look forward to getting my new york magazine every week and wherever i may roam i will maintain my subscription i hope those tony guys will read this and for the love of pete stop sending me this is your last chance crap in the mailhappy at the risk of losing my useful funny cool thingies i wanted to thank all my peeps who congratulated me on my review damn i love you guys
i have to agree with all the other posters that this place is the end to all hangovers gam mee ok seriously needs to patent sul long tang and package it to duane read as hangover medicine ill take a case i cant even tell you the countless times ive come to this place after one or fifteen too many drinks and it never fails to cure my drunkenness or hangover
stars because its cents a stars because theres a lot of pizza much much worse than this that costs a lot more you know im not stars because its good but no in case all you knights of the round table are wondering its not the fabuloso holy grail of stars because it doesnt need to beits cents a slice and it tastes and feels like pretty good ordinary ny pizzadid i mention it was cents yet
im amazed at being the first to review the sisley store on broadway since this is one of the few mens clothing stores with a conscience these people care about how we are supposed to look everyday they understand that the ussr is dead and never revamping jeans contraband they measure carefully because they know that not all of us are doomed to liposuction they know that what kipling said was true humans are the only animals that blush yes and thus they must dress our sin with style sisley knows how to combine design colors and cut their seasons sometimes veers through curves that i dont particularly like but then i would come back to find such a plethora of beautiful sweaters polos sport jackets that my wallet cries for mercy relax chump i tell the old fendi hound dog this is not prada youll survive and so we have sisley has rocked my world the style is sexy without being over the top the pastels they use do echo the benetton parent but not so as to deny sisley a proper identity i like their suits sleek and stylish yet elegant affordable and then theres the cut perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect im glad you exist sisley and thus i thank the stars all of em

fear factor see belowi love woorijip because if you go at lunchtime or dinnertime and youre in a hurry you get fresh food at very reasonable pricesthinking about asian food in relation to frightened people reminds me of an episode of fear factor the announcer was like and now were going to have you eat scary stuff so he lists a bunch of stuff like oh i dunno like tarantula hair and discarded snake skin etc and then he says topped with fish saucelol fish sauce thats whats on fear factor dude saute that up and dont be shy with the patisfilipino for fish sauce baby thats a staple of asian cooking and your local asian fast food place probably snuck some of it in your lunch you big dorkusi have to tell a quick woorijip story i lost a friend because i took her there after church one day and she was hungry she looked around impatiently and in an angry yet whiny voice she said god i dont even know what the hell it is im going to eat in here im like uh i know youre vegetarian and you eat seafood so look here is some nice scallion pancakes korean sushi look kim chi and seafood or bi bim bop you know stuff that is composed of rice and vegetables she freaked out and said im starving i dont know what the hell im eating in here and she stormed out we ended up going to a bagel place down the street where she ate a dry bagel with cream cheese yumjesus christ people it wasnt dried space food it is asian food it was literally variations of rice and vegetables but i guess in unrecognizeable frightening shapes likesushi shape or maybe the combination of rice and fresh vegetables in a bowl that was labeled bi bim bop was too much for her to handlegood riddance to small mindedness anyway she was from a small town in massachussetts which i guess explains her ignorance in food outside the wonder bread food group aaarghanyway yes try woorijipif you can handle it bwahahahahahaha
growing up as i did in a setting where the best toys were the ones that magically came from abroad through my fathers tours i learnt to respect and value toys as a toddlerin much the same way as adults respect their art collection or their blackberriesespecially when they pay attention to their berries to the detriment of good conversation with their friends like many of us i have friends who do just that but i digress toys have never ceased to fascinate me i had a choochoo train that would produce smoke in a puffing pattern and then there was the apollo and a volkswagen beetle i graduated to a fullfledged train set thanks again to my father and there was the rubiks cube i had a friend who was a whiz kid who cracked the code of the cube and solved it in less than a minute consistently i digress againwell back to the review i used to think franz carl weber in zurich was it when i lived there and then hamleys in london seemed even better but fao beats them both yes hamleys is bigger but big is not always better in toy storesi would think fao makes the largest share of its profits on the rich kids around central park south who can afford customized sixfoot tall horses and lifesize barbies but their flagship store location here in new york is a glorious treat for a wide range of ages although you occasionally see folks beyond that age range wandering around the storethe great things about fao are the toys are top notch they encourage you to play with the toys on display and they have uniformly good service fao doesnt like being labeled a toy store but a top attraction in new york city which it clearly is oh a fourth plus pointas you browse their selection you can munch on goodies from fao schweetz that is housed within the storei think fao is to new york what nip and tuck is to celebs you can likely live without it but why risk it
two memorable quotes from this dinner both from julie this food is so good i want to eat my hand bc of the sauce on i just burped up watermelon and it was still greatjust stellar so good up and down the menu and friendly helpful staff yeah it needs to be bigger and it would be helpful if they took reservations but i knew there would be a wait and came prepared that really makes all the difference we also got the table right by the door which caught cold blasts when it opened and you know what i couldnt have cared lessbecause the wings pork buns watermelon pork salad pretty much the best thing besides the crab short ribs and crab holy shit were just epic tasting this is my kind of restaurant in almost everyway so spiicy and savory screw desert get me a pbr and more bread for the crab saucealso a quick tip the general manager looks a lot like the chef zach so just make sure which one it is before you take him aside to compliment him on the food not that he minds the compliments of course
seriously if i see one more bad review for the subwaythe subway is new york people one part modern stylish fast and efficient and running hours a day and the other part dirty rundown a little scary unreliable and perhaps a little smelly but thats why its amazingif you want something sanitary and predictable buy an suv and move to the suburbs our subway kicks ass and i can deal with the occasional rat random route change or homeless man peeing in a corner to be able to get anywhere in the city for long live the best public transportation system in the world
little branch is my favorite bar in new york let me count the delicious cocktails i have never had a subpar drink great music including live piano the staff is warm attentive attractive but not you basically cannot stump their bartenders they seem to know how to make any obscure elixir youre craving try a sazerac or a red last but not least when i take dates here they are impressed and immediately understand that i am sexy mysterious and alluring everyone wins
this is unquestionably a sushi place fish is some of the freshest best cuts the sushi chef owns the joint so that helps hes meticulous selects great cuts of fish they also have a pretty wide selection of rolls and appetizers try the miso black cod or narutomaki in summer its heaven but heres why you want to stop reading this review get dressed go to and st this very second price its insane in this area ave evillage you can either go to bennys burritos spend on two burritos or go to kurasushi spend on sushi for two think im joking forego the sake order sushi for two peeps you get free soup or salad comes w excellent carrotginger dressing when you order worth of sushi per person your bill will be range often that includes the tipnowgo back get the sake your bill for two will still be around if i go to the sushi place across the street thats all i get for sake but at kura its a full meal for twoburritos or sushi is always such a tough choice another plus people always mention if people from the respective country eat there thats a good sign kinda like when im in kiribati restaurants i always see so many kiribatians its unrealanyway many japanese peeps frequent this place because they know its the shizz such a term i knowbut maybe it will make you hungry for sushiand if youre there on a night where nobu and koko are there say hello amazingly friendly peeps i love this place when i die i want my ashes to be spread on the sidewalk
the ultimate culinary dining experience i was impressed with every aspect of this place a definite must for special occasions and the service the service they spoiled me rotten first of all there is someone to take you to the restroom then theres an attendant waiting for you to escort you back to your table maybe thats overkill we had the tasting menu and it was probably the best french experience ive ever had in the us after our cheese course there was a waiter that came around pushing a cart loaded with homemade caramels lollipops nougats all individually wrapped waiter would you care for some homemade lollys caramelme no thank you im stuffedwaiter hand me your pursethe waiter stuffed my handbag full of the above candies talk about unpretentiousnessafter the maitre d put my coat on he handed me a small gift bagme whats thismaitre d some homemade chocolate chip brioche for tomorrow morning the bag was still warmalain ducasse many french kisses to you
kids are always excited because theyve lived only a few years and still have yet to experience the many wonders that life has to offer you ever seen a baby when its had that first taste of ice cream the initial expression is one of surprise followed shortly by confusion huh what is this new sensation and then complete and utter elation so now that ive had a few years under my belt those firsttime yowza moments are becoming fewer and further between one of the more recent occurences happened a few years back when i tasted my first slice at joes now coming from california i thought all pizza was supposed to have a yeasty bready crust and have copious amounts of sauce and gooey cheese i know totally shameful but now ive seen the light the piping hot slice had a thin crispy crust the perfect amount of delicious sauce and a layer of bubbly cheese perfect my face like a frickin newborns
as so many others in this city i am a cupcake junkie but it wasnt until yesterday that i finally sampled the cupcakes at sugar sweet sunshine bakery on the les the verdict i loved them and i loved the general vibe of sssb relaxed atmosphere with comfortable chairs and tables good coffee and lots and lots of delicious cupcake morsels i think that one of the things that i like most about sssb is the variety of cupcakes im tired of just vanilla and chocolate and different colours of icing i want a little excitement and thats what i found here i tried the chocolate red velvet pistachio and pumpkin cupcakes yes im fat today and what ive discovered is that the ones that retain the moist goodness a feature that we all search for in cupcake production are the ones with nuts or moist fruitvegetable in them the pistachio was my absolute favorite with the pumpkin being a close second love the cream cheese icing i think im kind of over red velvet at this point although i still love the idea theyre just so often dry but here they were pretty good just not as good as the others are these my favourite cupcakes in the city so far yes
if i had the luxury to spend hours and hours in a coffee shop this would be it dear god i just love this place damn the owners beat me to it only by a decade or so but if i were to start my own coffee shop this is exactly what it would look and feel like its as if they picked up the blue print from my mindhow can one not love this place hidden on the side streets of west village it is unpretentious but cozy has both cute decor vases flowers couch etcetera and free wireless internet connectivity a skylight as well as a library of books much like my elder brothers brought back memories of childhood good munchies as well as very good organic coffee plus great selection of teas ive tried their cappuccino latte mocha and regular coffeeexcellent stuffafter the biscotti i was tempted to try the peppomint cup but remembered that sam p had highly recommended the peanut butter cup obviously the decision became a nobrainer i had both while the peppomint was only average rock hard texture the peanut butter cup was delicious i tried to be casual about licking my fingers but no such luck the friends called me on it particularly since i didnt even offer to share it hey why dont you try the peppomint cup damn that peanut butter cup was really small over before i knew it grounded draws in an interesting cast of characters eclectic and entertaining to watchthe full time student sighted alternating between writing papers emailing and web surfingthe soontograduate student sighted surfing company websites tailoring resumesthe freelance writer sighted in need of a java fix and some inspirationthe literary dudette sighted reading milan kundera and not turning a single page in the hour and half that i was therethe cool dude sighted halfasleep on the couch newspaper in front of himthe cool dudes sidekick sighted trying to bask in reflected glory and chat up the girl next to himthe wannabe dude sighted working his hands through his hair while talking on his cell juggling his drink and food and hoping to catch the eye of the above cool dudethe poor girl who has to suffer the clumsiness of the wannabe dude sighted feverishly wiping the coffee which the wannabe dude has just thoughtlessly spilled over her laptopthe mom sighted proudly watching her toddler crawl all over the coffee shop and interrupt serious conversationsthe foodies sighted debating the merits of the mud pie over the coffee the couples sighted in various stages of lovey doveyness the friends sighted and participated catching up with each otherthe gossips sighted i knew he was going around pretending to be single to other girls i kept telling zee she should also cheat on him with other menour very own nathan hale sam p not sighted whose multidimensional personality can not be reduced to a stereotypeonce student life is over you realize that you no longer own your time grounded may not make the best cup of coffee in nyc but there is no other coffee shop where id like to spend as much time its enough reason to consider moving to the neighborhoodfor those who like text message reviews i have two words stay grounded
sushi yasuda will be the first fivestar review i write and will probably stay that way for a while being a sushi aficionado i am very particular about my fish and yasuda is one of those establishment where you cannot even begin to fathom what you are missing until you experience it do believe all the hype and the accolades it is ridiculous how fresh the fish tastes and the service is topshelfneed convincing otherwise just sit at the bar and order the omakase its so good that you will accidentally scream out yasuda sans name while youre having sex with your girlfriend and thats okay because your girlfriend will do the same because she ordered the spanish mackerel and kanpachi sashimi the spanish mackerel at yasuda simply melts in your mouth and is nothing short of orgasmic yes go ahead and order a plateful no one is judgingfor those that are budget conscious there is also a sashimi or sushi pre fixe dinner if you do decide to go with the budget dinner good luck trying to stop your inner sushi slut from ordering more i know i cant i usually rack up a hefty bill at the end of the night but there is not an ounce of regret in me yes its that goodso what are you waiting for reservation for two at see you there
sweet zombie jesus i have found my ideal barany bar where the patrons get shhhhhhd two or three times over the night is just how i like it i basically vomit knives at the standard crowded loud place in the east village i have longed to try the burp castle for a long while now and i was not disappointed in the leastmelissa the barmaid is that term sexist she was awesome at her job regardless of the term was great at giving me suggestions for beers and gave me little tastes of risky beers like the very hoppy bengali tiger before pulling me a full glass on draught this is a bar i could actually feel comfortable coming to on my own and pulling up a table with a book and a pint and enjoying myselfthe place being around the corner from pommes frites and an easy poutine just a side benefit
ducttaped booths cheap beer popcorn hot dogs of questionable age and composition and a smiling pig statue that welcomes you insidei am so glad i live near rudys there are several beers from on tap comfortable if somewhat haggard seating and even an outdoor area in the back before i went to rudys it had been far too long since i had a hot dog at the hot dog was not really hot and it did not taste good but to me it was the idea of the hot dog that matteredhaving processed meat products nearby when you are drinking is oddly comfortingthe best thing about rudys is the crowd it draws youre as likely to see piercings as you are pinstripes at least thats been the case when ive gone there and thats the mark of a good bar to me that and friendlylooking pig statues
pearl oyster bar where have you been all my life i couldnt have walked into this place with higher expectations after seeing this restaurant at the top of the yelp rankings but it still managed to exceed themi got there at on a wednesday night and was greeted by a very pleasant hostess who informed me it would be an hour wait on a wednesday night man this place must be greattwo beers and a glass of cheap but yummy spanish wine later my companion and i are seated time check hour and a half of buildup note we were offered seats at the bar before then but figured we waited that longstarted by splitting raw oysters and a bowl of clam chowder the oysters were amazingly fresh no tricks just oysters on ice lemon wedge cocktail sauce and i think vinegar i couldve downed two plates of these oysters i dont buy into the aphrodisiac thing with oysters but these oysters were hitting some pleasure center in my brain that doesnt usually get reached by food but afrodisiac hell with these oysters i could go from a shucking to c smoking without engaging in any action b that rhymes with a id consider these more of a postphrodisiac bc id have sex with someone just to get these oystersok if i havent spoiled your appetite yet onto the most erotic of the creambased mollusk soups the new england clam chowder mmm thick but not heavy clammy but not fishy faint smoky bacon taste right amount of potatoes couldve used perhaps a few more clam bits in there but as is it was still as good if not better than any chowder ive had in new england or sf thank god it wasnt manhattan clam chowder the red brothy imposter that has fooled oh so many chowderseekersguiliani could clean up times square but he couldnt correct this injustice and ban that soup andor remove our fine boroughs name from itnow to the main course lobster roll a buttery hot doglike roll overflowing with chunks of lobster connected together by as little mayo as seemingly possible i hate mayo so that was great this was joined with shoestring fries that are so skinny they resemble those potato stick snacksone bite of the lobster and im in crustacean heaven well homosapien heaven i dont believe in an afterlife but if any species deserves a nice one its lobsters im not opposed to cracking open a lobster but it sure is nice when you can just appreciate how tasty lobster is without breaking out the shellcracker a bib or dairy nectar drawn butter so glad i wasnt starving bc i tantracize this experience out some minutes and its in a hot dog roll whats the average startfinish time for a hot dog minutes the delicious fries which i douse with malt vinegar help extend the moment i probably talked during this time but it mustve been thanks to some autopilot conversation process my mind set up like a backup generator for moments when society requires something more than my preoccupied brain can provide often exercised during football games if someone dares talk about anything except footballi finish and am shocked to discover that im not in a waferthin mint state where i fear explosion i could eat dessert too the offerings look great a hot fudge sundae and apple crumble pie seem like fastballs down the middle a butterscotch prailine parfait seems like something id never order but the waitress recommends it so giddyup and its great i dont like butterscotch and i loved it perfect ending to a perfect dinnerby the time i got home i had to fight the temptation to yelp it but the experience wasnt over still had some lobster rolls and oysters to consume in my dreamsso i write this nowin the morningin a posteuphoric stateoh shit its gotta get to work

ditto sam ditto having just browsed through this weeks yelp nyc email i thought to myself huh i do not remember at all what i wrote for zabars so i looked and lo and behold it has nothing to do with being overworked overtired or overunmemoried i have not yet reviewed zabars jeez if my mother found out id never hear the end of it oy veyso zabars drool wipe chin drool again have some dried apricots they have the best ones ever all their dried fruit and nuts whoop ass then continue to drool on yourself as you wander around like a kid in a candy store which you kind of are except theres much much more cheese liver salad pastries you want it its here i mean my goodness eat something you look so skinny
your mom always said to wear clean underwear in case you got into a car accident at least mine did but if you want better care when you get to the hospital wear something from ap everything is sexy only about is practical did you know that there are bedroomonly bras i thought the point of being in your bedroom was that you did not have to bother the store is posh and unlike some other prolific underwear chains in the city which only seem to cater to brazilian models with ccups or greater ap has sizes for everyone gifted or otherwise or less and dont be intimidated by the glamorous salesgirls in lab coats and what must surely be nice underwear underneath they are extremely nice nonjudgemental and can not be shocked but buyer tryer beware there is no privacy in the dressing rooms they walk in unannounced to adjust fit push up pull down and otherwise make you look fabulous without a treadmill in sight all this of course comes at a price so goodness if for some horrible reason you do end up in the emergency room trauma bay in your ap knickers dont let the trauma team nab them with their trauma shears
fried chickenthis place isnt your normal kfc kentucky fried chicken its more like korean style fried chicken yes i know bad jokeso probably amongst the many who will be frequenting here from the outer boroughs and who dont live in the area will be coming here to try to place out because they read about it in a new york times article there will be plenty more reviews after mine im sure run on sentence very sohow is this place i think it is a very good alternative to the traditional fried chicken out there i dont feel like my arteries are going to clog up but that feeling every once in a while is good it is not heavily breaded even though their breading is a bit fluffy but crispy there are several flavors to order from original spicy mustard sweet and spicy soygarlic and hot i had ordered the hot and original just to see how it tasted without the sauce the original obvious tasted plain but the breading gaving it a little flavor so it wasnt so bad the hot is really good at first you dont really taste it that hot but afterwards oh boy nice and spicy the chicken isnt fried too much and since all the parts are dark meat it isnt dry ive tried all the flavors here already except for the mustard flavor because i dont really like mustard my favorites are the ufc spicy and the ufc soy garlic the sweet and spicy is more sweet with a little hint of spicy but you cant really tell all too much at times they might run out of certain flavors as they told me once when i tried to order a flavor that ran out that most of the ingredients are imported so if the shipment arrives late they wont have a certain flavor so be prepared to choose an alternativewith your order you can choose from different chicken parts for a small order you can have all wings a mix of wings and drumsticks wings drumsticks just drumsticks or a whole chicken i prefer a mix of the wings and drumsticks it makes for a better deal a whole chicken is a little more than a large order for the price in my opinion is a little high but for what you get healthier fried chicken and unique taste i think its worth it for a small order it is and a large order is with each order you get a salad choice which you can choose from the marinated radish coleslaw macaroni salad or a side saladthe also offer a chicken ranch or parm panini along with fries regular and sweet potato and other salads premium chef and crispy chicken but i didnt order any of those my gf had ordered the crispy chicken salad recently the salad isnt anything all too special but she did like the tenderness and taste of the small piece of breaded chicken that was with the salad the restaurant isnt that big there is a table that seats about people and then a bar seating area that seats about when i got there yesterday there were about people around waiting for their food but when i went to pick up my food about later there were just people aroundright now since everyone is probably going to come here because they read the article about the new korean style fried chicken its suggested you call ahead of time to make your order or youll have to wait about for your food if you dont live in the area it might just not be worth the trip for the wait since things have calmed down lately it only takes about to get your food so no need to really call ahead if you are in the area but safer to do soupon completing this review this is the first time ive tried korean style fried chicken and since this might be a new fad out there i have nothing to compare it to even though there is bon chon in manhattan this was the more convenient location for me since i live in the area i personally give this place stars because i have nothing else to compare it to however if you really want to try the best version of this chicken my cousin suggests going to boom boom chicken in fort lee nj

pastramigasm eating at katzs now i realize that meg ryan wasnt faking her orgasm in the scene shot here in when harry met sally she was actually having one because of the foodok yes the service is slow you pick one of the many lines for the cutters kind of like picking a supermarket checkout line it took great restraint to hold back the operational guru in me queuing theory people we want a single queue and multiple operators but katzs has been around since its just how they do things kind of like when your grandfather makes offcolor nonpc remarksits really too late to change him and you love him anywayok back to the food there are two things that youre allowed to get here the pastrami and the reuben thats it dont come here and order a salad or some crap like that this place is about meat glorious meat sandwiches are pricey at but theyre big enough for two people to share and the quality of the meat is well worth it thank god i dont live near katzs id easily gain pounds

i cannot believe that this french pastry place has not been given a review yet i mean yummers my eyes always get big when i come here and everytime i get anytihng here i am reafirmed that food is definately the thing to choose over sex anyday and i mean everything there makes me think thatso come try the espresso the eclairs especially the coffee flavored eclair try the other cakes and goodies they have there sit and people watch and imagine being in paris sitting by the street watching people pass by as you enjoy your pastry making yourself happy knowing people are missing out since you got something yummy and maybe just maybe youll agree with me and decide yes i choose this over sex thank you ok yes im pushing it but that should be enough to make you make the trek up here to try it and then thank me later
deep fried peanut butter jelly sandwich from a vending machinethat should be nuff said right there this place almost burned my retinas off when i first came across it its so bright and pink its absurd i had never seen anything like it before and was utterly delighted after i got my food i had a blast just hanging out and watching people have the same reaction that i did if youre not a food snob and you value ridiculousness as much as i do youll love this place
suckling pig omgoodness let me take a moment to breathe and relive sighokay im back as a lover of swine this special dish at boqueria is a mustget and the reason for a review when i asked the waiter to describe it he went to tell the story of the pigs required preparation when he finished i teared up a little and when i tasted it i nearly wept it was that good on top is a crispy salted layer below is the juicy tender flavorful meat the large thick slice sits on top a bed of root vegetables mostly celery i think and winesap apples oh god it is so goodasides from the suckling pig boqueria is mainly a sceney tapas joint located a little northwest of union square theres a long narrow bar area read tight that leads to a larger dining area thats dimly lit with rows of closely set small tables along the edges and two large wooden communal tables in the center and the mood here is decidedly lively which is code for loud a good place for smallish groups to partake in the diverse tapas menu we tried the mackerel yummy the serrano ham croquettas creamy goodness and the cod fritters eh its a little on the pricier side for tapas but id definitely go back again for the pig of course
im so sorry sunburnt cow for doubting you and passing you by all those times in favor of other establishments how could i have known that behind that creepy orange door there would be a classy bar lounge area and spacious yet intimate back room how could i have guessed that there could be an austrailian restaurant in bumblefuck east village even though i live only a block away your bessy sandwich was heaven perfectly cooked steak housed in barbeque sauce lettuce tomato and toasted bread the calamari salad which could have easily come as a green salad topped with a few bites of calamari was instead a big bowl of tender calamari kiwi and green pepper how odd how tasty and the sunburnt cow your namesake drink i dont even like tequila you know what im just gonna have to take you to the next level sunday brunch and unlimited mimosas and bloody marys this is going to be the start of a beautiful dependency
ever find out about an amazing band before everyone else hopped on slowly but surely you noted mentions no raves in the press and maybe they started playing webster hall instead of the mercury lounge their sound hadnt changed but you may have stopped buying their records because they had ceased to be your special little secret i think we all do this to a certain extent and i was guilty not with a band but with chikaliciousthe first of its kind in nyc i think sugar in chicago was the first of its kind in the country but they were more of a nightclubbar and theyre also long gone it was a revelation here was a meticulous and imaginative chef serving some of the best desserts in nyc i think a lot of places plate desserts beautifully but they lack in flavor chikas desserts are as beautiful to look at as they are to taste something of a minimalist but in the best possible way really letting the flavors of each ingredient shine through so what changed maybe it was the much longer wait for a table as people caught on the thing is it was worth waiting for so it was probably something else did it become trendy yes do i despise trends generally yes the thing is for once the trend was justifiable it may have helped paved the way for other places like room dessert and sam masons hotly anticipated at least by me new joint i recently returned to chikalicious waited on line for a good bit in the cold had a ridiculously good dessert and was reminded of why it became so popular in the first place

new yorks penn station is home to the greatest fashion show on earthinstructionsarrive early sunday morning and you will see all the people arrested by the fashion police the night before who waiting for their court mandated ride out of town were talking people wearing nothing more than crabs and footie pajamas or how about a theme outfit of golden dollar signs on a white jumpsuit with matching sneakers worn and heres the important part without irony i wont even get into the guy who wanders around in short shorts with a plastic crate and screams like someone just stole his ice creamid give it six stars if i could
as close to paris as you can get cozy joint crowded of course tables close as they should be sort of like a french mess food is great but somewhat slow atmosphere likewise but not slow you will probably have to wait in the bar but thats ok cause it is full of nice beautiful people who just love to talk to you service is friendly and has a younguish touch to it which is perfect for an old guy like me if you want to find a place for your next date this is a good candidate go for the sensual oysters so enjoy and if you need company for dinner gimme a call
ok where do i even start here roosevelt field is without question the most fantastic mall on the planet though i am not a big fan of many things coming from long island and i am a long islander myself so no offense to any others i can not go to any other mall without thinking roosevelt field is waaaayyyy better than this holeinthewall from the very basics like the gap express mens and womens abercrombie and jcrew to the slightly more upscale chains such as jasmine sola french connection and coach this place has every store you can imagine one thing i must warn you about parking is a bitch never expect to be able to get a parking spot in front of nordstroms or bloomingdales unless youre willing to circle the parking lot for a couple of hours waiting for a spot to open up right outside macys is your best bet for a free spotand ladies did i mention you might even be able to get your boyfriendshusbands to tag along with no complaints just mention the words game stop the sharper image and the apple store and theyll be waiting by the car keys in hand
ive had an epiphany im convinced that dom demarco is not a man he is a god well he doesnt wear a white robe or have a fluffy white beard or float on clouds or anything that youd normally consider to be godly but he does preform miraclesedible miracles and thats enough to make him a god isnt itthe first bite of a pie from difara pizzeria is a revelation that youve just had an epiphany youve just seen a true master the god of all things pizzay everyone that loves pizza should build churches write a bible and bow down and worship him its like youve just taken a peek into heaven almost like when you were a kid and you found where your parents hid the christmas presents and realized there is no santa youll see that there is no pizza other than his its all a farce youll be floored hell i was floored i didnt want to stop chewing the first bite by now everyone has covered how he does it i mean youll see how he does it about times before you see how he does yours but its worth it its a oneman show on the train to pizzadeliverance deliverance in the going to heaven sense bible stuff all that jazzthis pizza will change your lifeit changed mine i gotta get to building that church now
i must confess had this not been a great experience it would still get a good review based on my waiter being the hottest man who has ever lived if you ever go there ask for chris trust medivine bar is known for their wine flights but the rebel i am i went for the last martini a divine mixture of pomegranate and lychee puree along with a bellyful of vodka it is just about the priciest martini ive ever had but it is also the biggest unless you are a practiced happy hourer you may not be able to handle more than one even that is a struggle but a delicous one indeedwe attempted to be good girls shari ordered the chicken salad i orded the spinach salad however we quickly destroyed our virtue by pairing it with the avocado spring rolls and thenthere was dessertjoey bag of donuts indeed because for you get a bag of hot fresh mini donuts and a variety of dipping sauces martinis and donuts i hve found heaven and it was divineseriously a great find but a bit pricey so save for a special treat or for when you need some special eye candy that is
i love the historic bars of new york and this is one of the great ones tremendous history and decor great photos light and dark beer yeah yeahall that has been writtenbut what i dont see and ive read quite a few of the reviews here but not all of them is the tribute to the mcsorleys mustard its downplayed its not mentioned its avoided its mentioned in passingbut what makes everything work here is the mustard that stuff packs some amazing punch get the cracker and cheese platter they bring an unopened wrap of saltines some good sliced cheddar and some sliced onions it is amazing how such a simple dish is the perfect accompaniment to the beer combine the cracker cheese and onions slather on some mustard and knock off a glass of beer to wash down the heat repeat share your platter with the friendly crowd at the table you were squeezed into make friends talk about the mustard the history of the place hear how many of the people there were brought there originally by their dad or their grandpa make another sandwichfeel your sinus clear see the sinus of the people around you clear order another round of beers i prefer the dark to the light to wash down the mustard stack another crackeror try the ham and cheese sandwich yeswith mustard wash it down with the beer enjoy the crowd dont try bantering with the waiters cause they are not in the mood another cracker and cheese some more mustard another beer feeling no pain nowjust a drop of tearing from the mustard yep a great night a great place and great mustard darni dont see them selling that stuff too bad
ive been going to the peking duck house with my family since i was a little kid its been through a few name changes but the staff is still the same they even recognized my sister when we walked in the door twenty years and this place is still just as good as it was when i was little the peking duck is the bets i have ever hasd and they bring it out to you still with the head on and carve it in front of you its an experiencethe best part is we were so drunk my family started doing all the things we used to do as kids my sister and i fighting over who gets more food my father and i making teeth out of orange peels and putting them in our mouths if we had been anyplace else they would totally have thrown us outbut not the peking duck house they treated us like family

after a weekend of backtoback sampling of the goodies at billys and sugar sweet sunshine bakery i am done with cupcakes for a while at least with the cupcakes at billys theres no debate in my mind sugar sweet sunshine rulz the cupcake worldhow can peg and deb the owners resist the heavenly creations from their own shop it makes no sense to see the olsen twinthin girls when they have the most amazing cupcakes and desserts around them so what differentiates cupcakes from the others the frosting is just right and smooth neither too sweet nor too stiff not overpowering yet each flavor distinctive the cakes truly exceptional soft moist and best of all unlike billys doesnt break up into crumbs at every bite annoying to manage when there is no seating availablefreshness isnt an issue as they bake day long they also have a wider selection of flavors the ones i found truly exceptional were pumpkin pistachio sassy chocolate almond icing with red velvet and coconut sassy and sexy are both delicious sassy over sexy also as i am extremely partial to cream cheese frosting pumpkin i am not amused when billys has none available in their cupcakes no such issue at cupcakes are so amazing that in a period of one and a half hours this past saturday i polished off cupcakes and still managed to enjoy the delicious pineapple upside down cake soft moist flavorful and light compare this to the supersized crumbs where i struggled to finish off even one regular cappuccino cupcaketheir chairs are comfortable and the ambience warm and inviting exactly what magnolia set out to be years ago but lost its way in the process the one likely issue is limited seating especially since the regular patrons stay and chat for hours on endlike that at billys service also doesnt enthuse i ordered a cappuccino while my friend asked for tea the server responded which tea we have so many do you have any idea of what you want i could have been wrong but it seemed that he had emphasized any that called for a lesson in humility and so i responded darjeeling sheepishly he said no oolong no my friend catching on asked orange pekoe yet again no so what kind of tea do you have server by now looking down earl grey chamomilethey dont have a wash room like buttercups and their location isnt that of magnolias or billys but i cant rate them at the same level sugar sweet sunshine rulz despite the issues i just raised they deserve stars for the incredible cupcakes dont walk run to sugar sweet sunshine i certainly need to run a few hours everyday now n cupcakes

juniors is one brooklyn institution that lives up to the hype its just a shame that most downtown brooklyn institutions like the paramount the fox and scores of other old school theaters have not survived along with the maker of one of the best cheesecakes anywhere still as old downtown brooklyn continues to die a slow death and transforms itself into the ratner city space station juniors will remain dont even bother trying to procure a cheesecake on the eve of a big family holiday not going to happen the lines are three deepnow thats girth lil inside joke for those who remember me misusing girth in the mark w post best part about juniors is that the cheesecake isnt the sole reason to eat here they have a pretty impressive diner menu that includes an enormous hamburger that would easily fill the most bottomless pit of a belly the portion of fries served with a deluxe is generous and even gratuitous given the size of the burgers more than anything i find the wait staff incredibly kind and accommodating given the daily pressures they must encounter with the sheer number of customers our waiter returned no less than timesand not in an annoying manner to make sure we had everything we needed also if you have room dont pass up any of their old school diner classics like a milk shake or a cherry lime rickeyjuniors blends them all to perfection just do yourself a favor and make it to juniors before you die travel with that death or cheesecake spirit and your meal will be that much more satisfying personally i prefer cheesecake to deathps what was that guy talking about a few reviews downyou know the guy who was disappointed that there was no sour cream on his cheesecake wtf poor guy hes probably been putting cream cheese on his baked potatoes for years
why oh why did i waste a meal here with a guy my buddy and i decided to grab sushi so we walked into this joint on a friday night and sat down at the sushi bar one of the sushi chefs took care of us we told him wed eat whatever he gave us we had some eggplant appetizer arctic char nigiri japanese mackerel aji sashimi bluefin toro some other stuff and the clincher japanese uni flown in that day and only fridays from osaka the uni was like cool creamy butter and probably the best thing thats ever touched my mouth including a couple of bottles of sake and beer it set us back about each with the tip it was damn well worth it if only i could get a date id have taken her instead
theres something really nice about visiting a restaurant past its trendiness prime its like seeing the hot guy from hs a few years later after hes given up being the big shot trying to impress everyone and finally getting to know him for who he ismy friend and i stopped by for late night drinks and munchies i guess i did more of the drinking and she did more of the munching but whatever there was one waiter for the whole restaurant which at i suppose isnt too crazy whenever you could flag him down he was a sweet and helpful guy again the poor guy had up to tables to handleblaming him for not being the bionic waiter would be silly i hope the rude people sitting next to us that kept bitching to the manager for free food are reading thisthe food was fantastic we started with the samba roll which better deliver at well it did theres a good amount of lobster in the roll as well as a powerful kick of wasabe and the textures very important in sushi work together so well then we ordered the kobe beef flat bread which is drizzled in the most amazing green sauce and the yellowtail sashimi seviche was todiefor ive never had such beautifully soft buttery yellowtail okay so ive never paid for it either the drinks were poured well and were strong i had so many mojitos my breath was fabulous when i left the scene was nice but not nearly as cool as i imagined it would be i guess you can imagine lots when youre looking in through yellow orange tinted windows but the vibe suited the place well enough and i am definitely interested in coming back for the brunch
the best slice in the neighborhood hands down its been around since i was a kid and i remember getting excited whenever i heard my parents mention that name because it always meant that they were too busy or too tired to cook up something healthy like brussel sprouts and we were going to have wonderful pizza for dinner yay said the little marthaits something about the cheese that they use there maybe theres an overdose of salt in there maybe its crack i dont know maybe salt is cracks sister and maybe thats why i like it so muchvery old school vibe there get a grape drink to go with your slice
man ive never been one to disagree with another yelpers review buttse yang is hands down my favorite fancyoccasion chinese restaurant in nyc maybe even my favorite fancyoccasion restaurant what really puts me over the edge is their peking duck good god they know how to make peking duck it absolutely is expensive for the plate makes about pancakes and then a second course but oh so worth it when you can afford a good treat for yourself or have someone else paying you really cant go wrong w the main courses i also recommend the beef tse yang style and their lobster in black bean sauce quite delicious the apps ill admit i havent been blown away with but they are still status quo for a nice chinese restaurant re the candycoated fried donuts on the table i cant really understand how one would be offended by that the apple donuts come fresh out of boiling water and are dunked into the cold water to crystallize the sugarcoating as a result when they are served to you they have this nice hard outside but a deliciously warm inside it is a full experience this is not some grand display that you are forced to watch i didnt even notice it the first time i had them it is just how they prepare it for you in the same way that they will show you a large plate of the duck skin before folding it into the pancakeshoison saucescallion service is very impressive maybe a little over the top our waiter didnt take notes and every time we would order something he would give us a fullllll description of the dish yah we know what the dish is were ordering it but heck its nice to be treated pretentiously every once in a while anyways were all entitled to our opinions is tse yang pretentious at yes but have you tasted their peking duck
lucky for me i live right on top of cafe buon gusto when the weather is warm i open my windows and let the smell of sauce waft into the living room that my friends can be dangerous cafe buon gusto is there anything you lack the pesto over home made ravioli is decadent my mothers chicken marsala was so good i discovered a new love for marsala sauce even penne pommodoro a quite simple sauce of riccota and tomato was incredibly tasty the bread is served along side a bowl of olives soaking in oil and the water is left on the table in an old wine bottle while buon gusto has tables outside inside is just adorable located on between second and third it feels off the beaten tracks of the tired italian spots lining second ave the inside is small but comfortable with warm light and dark furniture the place feels incredibly genuine and authentic with a precise waitstaff with italian affected accents i highly recommend cafe buon gusto but please stay away from my stoop
this is one of my favorite korean restaurants they have so many traditional free appetizers my favorite one is the raw crab in spicy red sauce their korean barbeque is always marinated with plenty of flavor and a lot of different varieties of meat kalbi which is my favorite bulgogi squid pork etc they also have many other delicious items on their menu like their seafood pancakes noodles soon doo boo and plenty of other traditional korean dishesmy only warning to potential diners would be to leave your jacket in the car and wear clothes that you will be washing soon the smell will stay on clothing for days some people like that the aroma reminds them of a delicious meal i on the other hand can do without the meat eau de toilette this place also has a sister restaurant on union street in flushing which i actually like more

my familys been coming here pretty much forever to buy packs of frozen baos because we cant get them upstate and theyre really good if you buy them frozen they keep in the freezer and you can either steam them or even microwave them for seconds and theyre hot and delicous these are really like the most delicous and mysterous food ever and the mysteriousness is the best part you really shouldnt concern yourself at all with whats inside even though they say its pork because my guess is the more you know the less you will like it they sell other stuff here too stuff thats not frozen but fresh and piping hot but if you dont speak or read chinese you have to be really adventurous because its generally hard to know what is what there is some english going on but the store is so tiny that if you dont know what you want right away youre going to be in someones way i like the sticky rice with pork or chinese sausage and peanuts wrapped in banana leaves hot and ready to eat my friend audrey used to bring these to work and eat them for lunch sometimes and i would stare with my mouth watering and she would toss me a peanut if she was feeling generous or call security on me if she was feeling normal sometimes her grandmother had made the sticky rice and sometimes it was her aunt so those ones were probably a little bit better than the ones from may may but the ones from may may are really good too and if you dont have a chinese aunt or grandmother of your own at some point you just have to accept that theyre probably the best youre going to get at a pop the deliciousnessconsumed to moneyspent ratio is in the sweet spot in fact i challenge you to eat two of these dudesif you beg for information the ladies who work at may may will even tell you how to pronounce some of the chinese names sure they look at you funny shaking their head when you screw up and they shake their broom at you after your twentieth or thirtieth question and they shout things at you that you dont understand but that probably mean something like get out of our store you clumsy white oaf in running clothes before you knock all our piles of stuff over but if they really dont want me around then why do they fill their store with such copious ammounts of delicous food and price it so low
when i was growing up this pizza parlor was called franks ive been to many pizza places in my lifetime but i remember that sals was called franks bc i went with a friend once and she ordered us pizza with extra cheese i had up to this point taken the cheese off pizza before eating it much to the chagrin of my older brothers the cool kids at school and i assume my future biographer who will be unhappy having to disclose the one foible of an otherwise flawless character that slice of pizza with extra cheese which i ate in was really really awesome and the experience has never been replicated fast forward seventeen years to tonight when i tried sals the place was pretty empty when i went around and i just got a plain slice and a bottle of seltzer it was pretty clean in therei have a thing about unclaimed dirty napkins and usually cant sit in pizza places bc of the napkinriddled floor but at sals i had a table to myself and no soiled paper products in sight the pizza was pretty delicious i mean i was thinking about how people are always talking about where to find good pizza but to me the best places are always the runofthemill unassuming stores where no ones blabbering on about the woodburning stove or the organic dough or god forbid the dairyfree cheese its important to remember that theres still regular old pizza in new york
dear billyi hate you im sorry but its true first you taunt me with your perfectly moist yellow cupcakes then you go ahead and force me to walk all the way over to avenue on a godforsaken windy effen day just to grab a few of your extra special carrot cake cupcakes thats carrot cake with lemon cream cheese frosting i mean lemon how did you know my weakness for that subtle citrusy flavor mixed with one of the worlds greatest creations cream cheese you make a fool of meand just when i thought i had overindulged enough just when i was beginning to get over youyou up and offer banana cupcakes with cream cheese ah frosting stop it just stop this is not fair youve officially spoiled all chances i had for a happy life without dessert now i cant go a week without thinking about you that warm light of nostalgia in your kitchen that sweet scent of baking cake the moment the door swings open youve ruined me foreverwith much despair and disdain i am yourswendy
its one of my favorite shapes of pasta the spirali remember the fisher price parking garage in defense of the exhibits its to attract a great crowd of people who may not otherwise step foot into a museum and certainly not one for art its not supposed to be heavy with airs of erudition its supposed to be fun and art lite
well let me tell you this is the only place to get your cheese just accept it as a fact there is no other take a walk along third ave and stop by the store whose windows are completely covered in colorful handwritten signs for cheeses and prices the storefront seems out of place but thats just because its been there for so long it looks like the grandaddy that will outlive all the lame little delis and salons that have recently moved in next door anyhow open the door for may we interest you in a giant hunk of herbed brie or some boursin which ususally sells for about or a nice log of goat cheese take another step foward and contemplate taking a ball of gouda the size of a wiffleball out of a big basket labled or maybe go to the cheese counter and get anything from a delicious havarti to a green soy cheddar uhmlet me know how this goes or you could get a variety of antipasto olives artichoke hearts gerkins roasted peppers or maybe some spiced ham or how about some cream cheese various types the list goes on in the back of the store gnocchi crackers jams pepperoni pesto cookies etc etc oh did i mention the coffee counter which has morning specials of coffee and danishes or you could get a quiche pie or a baguette when i was describing this shop to my friends it sounded like it was a huge megamart but in reality all of this magically fits into a little hole in the wall no bigger than your corner deli smaller acutally anyhow go have a ball set up a picnic or a fancy antipasto plate for dinner guests but just remember this store only takes cash but thanks to the prices you wont need much of it
little branch is an experience an event really i wouldnt just go here during some west village barhopping excursion but rather because i want a sexy sophisticated atmosphere where i can enjoy a fabulous cocktail with close friends little branch is the type of secret neighborhood bar that will really impress a date or some special outoftown guests once you locate the unassuming door on the corner of ave and leroy st you find yourself ushered down a small flight of steps into the bowels of the city a small low lit and inviting room awaits you at the bottom of the steps there are a number of comfortable booths lining the far wall each adorned with a single candle and hooks to hang your hat and coat if you cant get a table no worries as there is plenty of room near the bar putting the charming speakeasy aesthetics aside the main reason to go to little branch is for the cocktails drink specials are listed on a small menu and though wine and beer and even champagne are offered you will want to opt for one of the mixed drinks each bartender at little branch is trained by a master mixologist and even if you arent sure about what to order just trust the bartenders to create something special for you you will not be disappointed the drinks are so wellcrafted yes wellcrafted that you are able to taste each ingredient while still being able to enjoy the overall combination of a truly unique cocktail like fight club little branch has a few rules but i wont disclose them to you you should have the experience of discovering them for yourself during your first visit to the bar heres a big hint be sure to use the restroom at least once during your time at little branch

ive eaten sushi in tokyo including a place right in tsukiji sushi dai thats probably the best place ive eaten the fish was just to fresh and the price was right ive eaten at many of the high and low end sushi places in nyc from nobu to sushi joints in the east village ive also eaten at masas old place in beverly hills rodeo drive both my meal at ginza sushiko more than years ago and my meal at masa just after they opened are more memorable than any other meals ive eaten tiny baby squid lobster sabu sabu turo rolls just to name a few instead of going to atlantic city and dropping or go here
this place should be illegal and may soon be if the antitrans fat people get their waymmmjust thinking about this gets me salivatingi have never been to the brooklyn location just happy enough to return here anytimei always get the porterhouse steak for two it is huge and i can never finish it but it is a must i dont know what they do to this piece of meat but a lot of love must go into preparing it and i am sure there is some butter involved but whatever it is they do it is orgasmicas for the sides i always order their tomato and onion saladonce you do it becomes addictive very simple but hits the spotspinach of course creamy and i am sure deadly as for the special sauce they serve i could eat it with a spoon actually a friend of mine did just thatbut i think she must have ingested some illegal substance before dinner which made her act out exactly what i cravedthis is the one of those places i do coffee and dessert it is always their chocolate mouse cake i take my coffee black it is one way to rationalize all the calories besides it is that good enough herei have never had a bad wine here but i get so full that i just usually order by the glassdont forget to bring plenty of cash as they do not take credit cardsyou can open an account with them and get a peter lugers credit card but i am afraid this may be too dangerousthe atmosphere is always cozy and laid back quintessentially steakhouse ambiance i think they must pump something into the air because when i enter i drop all my inhibitions or maybe it is the whiff of steak mixed with power in the air very seductiveps to the yelper who said it was not romantic that depends on what you mean just read between the lines
this place is the reason i spend so many nights cryingcomplaining about missing ny the best sheesha on this side of the atlantic by far now lets get down to business if youre not middle eastern be prepared to be leered at by the staff and other patrons and expect a slightly longer wait for service if youre female for the sake of everyone please cover your mamaysno one wants to hear you complain about the skeezy terrorist ooglin your goodies you obviously wore that top so someone would oogle em if you walk down steinway in skanky clothes people will talk so keep that in mind and leave the tube top at home not that you should come nude but leave it at home in exchange for something more conservative this doesnt necessarilly refer to the wonderful staff at egyptian coffee shop but rather to steinway as a whole if youre female and arab that goes double for you not only does someone probably know your father but the skeezy men will stare twice as hard at their own kind all of this being said the atmosphere here and in other sheesha spots on steinway is amazing theyre open til i believe or am and you cant beat the price or the flavor
this place looks like new years and mardi gras barfed all over the inside of a railroad car if youve never been that may sound like a bad thing but i assure you it is just the most fun and ridiculous dining experience i always bring friends here who are visiting from out of town because honestly i dont know any other place in the world where the fire inspector would turn such a blind eye to the circuit and sensory overload of panna ii you would have to eat yourself stupid to break bucks on the menu entrees are about bucks and appetizers about buy a six pack or a bottle of wine before you go they are a byob establishment which only ads to the savings and delighti love the random bangra sp rap mixes on the stereo and the crazy happy birthday moments there were no less than dimming of the house lights and blaring indian birthday songs on my last visit one of my favorite things about going to panna ii is snubbing the copycat establishment right next doori tried them once when panna was too crowded and they were very rude so they are on my very short list of banned restaurants they always fight the panna peeps for customers at the top of the stairseven in winter both places have a guy outside vying for your business sorry manat those prices and a friendly staff that always remembers me panna ii is the winner and champion every time im in the mood for indian
innocence pastno its not much to see now but if it was a part of your life and in some ways it was a part of all of our lives go there to mourn an era of innocence past more specifically go there to contemplate and remember that the wtc as a perfect microcosm of new york city in marvelous compact miniature the gleaming towers represent to me the place new york holds as the business goliath it is it had tipofthearrow dining windows on the world down to subsistence eating namely the recurring open markets held on broadway streetside it was also a transportation hub offering travel through sea and air a communications and information center linking all parts of the world and it was its own ecosystem all of which new york city is to a greater degreethe wtc was also a crucible containing the entire spectrum of new yorkers from multimillionaire ceos to the undocumented workers whose surviving families cannot collect benefits because they had no identification and were not citizens of our countryperhaps the ultimate icon within the icon may have been the large spherical plaza sculpture by arnoldo pomodoro showing a onceperfect sphere perverted from within its ghastly inner workings bursting out like a biomechanical cancer it is an ironic symbol of a world shattered by forces that were inside of it all alongfive solemn stars
forget sushi sashimi who when you are drunk and hungry you want something fried and disgusting thats when you look for a hotdog stand or a pizzeria taisho yakitori on the other hand has good quality little munchies to big bowls of noodles to big boxes of varieties yakitori is basically skewers japanese stylethey have everything from chicken gizzard to all veg scallions to meats they also have awesomely huge jugs of frozen blend green apple drinks to different sized bottles of kirin and sapparo also a good light hotcold sake and shochu list its more fun to go when youve done a tiny bit of bar hopping lots of yapping against the japanese rock is fun we used to go alot after work too cheap too bad the young folks of nyc somehow discovered it and made it so that they card here now not that its a big deal but it used to be so foreign casual and easy going without that unnecessary theyre watching you feeling i adore how the studly yakitori cooks greet you from the grill as you walk in or out service is attentive in this quite cramped but not over claustrophobic seating place theres a lot of benches and little tops not much room for a crowd unless you go to taisho for the room in the back near the bathrooms is the original spot taisho cutest round ownerman alive had is much cleaner and has a bigger menu option even a bit of fresh seafood and such steamed mussel soup octopus etc order the chikuwa cheese that mayo goes with all salmon in seaweed rolls donkatsu bento box and everything else they have pictures since i am not able to name them mostly due to laziness with its correct japanese names you would probably be able to tell right away that taishos a popular guy from the polaroids all over the walls but its nice to see him the animated guy all over the menus hang out on the stoops of the restaurants no matter how easy it is to find yourself scurrying there go in small doses it can get lame after too many trips but only in a row you should still go a l o t

wonderful assembly of brands and items of superior quality in design and construction combined with attentive professional friendly and respectful service vs aloof terminally narcissistic too hip for the room of barneys sales associatesor however they are referring to themselves this moment shopping at bg is the way its supposed to bealbeit with its own latent realestate danger to explain it is impossible to be in this store and not start visualizing an entire new wardrobe so wheres the realestate connection you ask you then start considering new and more expansive walkinclosets to accommodate the wardrobefollowed by the larger home with the larger closets and voila youve just managed to justify a sevenfigure realestate expenditure based upon one of ermenegeldos new cashmere pullovers that demands to be carried homeyour new home at that and just when you congratulate yourself for having the selfdiscipline to leave with maybe only a couple of bags you find yourself walking south on past zengas and the baldissarini collection at hugo boss that new domicile is closer than ever
not having grown up in the northeast the concept of a lobster roll was entirely foreign to me i can even recall asking a friend from the region is that like a spring roll but with lobster inside i couldnt have been farther from the truthand fortunately the pearl oyster bars cuisine couldnt be farther from the cheap chinese food that prompted my first inquiry into the lobster roll on my first visit i was interested primarily in oystersas ive said in previous reviews i live to eat them raw and am thoroughly impressed when a restaurant satisifies my sick need for a living creature to die moments before i slurp and lustily chew it down sitting at the bar itself i ordered half a dozen oysters clam chowder and this mysterious item called the lobster roll the oysters were thoroughly excellentnot the best ive ever had oyster bar in grand central owns that distinction but seriously delectable the clam chowderwell it was light years beyond the stuff id grown up with at many and various red lobsters in chicago i was starting to feel full after eating it and was worried about the main course feeling nervous when the lobster roll arrived i did what i call the puzzled dog face tilting to the side and lifting the crown of the head highit was an openfaced sandwich with a ton of lobster meat in what looked like mayonnaise sided by a crapload of shoestring fries i dug in and my lifethe world indeedhas not been the same since i was full from the moment i bit into the roll but i couldnt stop it was just too damned good appeals from passersby were in vainthe bartender looked on in horror as i consumed approximately cue dr evil voice one billion caloriesand all with fingerlicking gusto and a gourmands contempt for the casual parttime feeder the pearl oyster bar changed my life maybe it can change yours

i worked at the met for almost three yearsi know it like the back of my hand my favorite galleries were the modern islamic and american wing galleries sooo much the everyday visitor doesnt know about those roomsespecially the american wing so beautiful so quiet back there too oh and the astor court in the chinese galleries and a word to the wise choose a few galleries you want to view for your visit the truth is there are millions of items on display and you could go back every day for the rest of your natural life and still not really see everything also to those who just want to donate instead of giving the suggested amountdont make a fuss at the register no one gives a rats ass why youre paying less just pay and be on your way weve heard everything believe me

i am a new yorker i was born in spanish harlem in at the flower on hospital i grew up on the upper west side and spent my formative years in public highschools throughout manhattan and brooklyn i went off to college at suny purchase in westchester and graduated with bfa in i did all this on a learners permit well not the being born part but once you get out of college a learners permit just doesnt cut it you go out to a bar and you hand over something that says learners permit and immediately you toughness quotient plummets so at i decided to get that license and finally grow up i signed up for an pack at the professional driving school the actual school looks really seedy it looks like they just moved in there is stuff stuck into corners and the bathroom looks like a the washroom in a russian submarine luckily you wont be spending much time there the classes start off with your hour class on driving safety which this school smartly schedules after working hours it was painless and you get to watch videos with scott baio explaining the importance of not drinking and driving the classes in the car were fantastic learning to drive in new york city is probably one of the best decisions i have ever made because once you feel comfortable driving in manhattan noting will scare you well except highway traffic in los angeles but thats another story you learn all the basics and my teacher was professional and very informative he picked me up during my lunch hour and we went through kturns city driving and lots of parallel parking when it was time for my test i met up with my instructor and drove over to staten island to take my test although i missed a stop sign oops my quick driving reflexes impressed the tester so much that she passed me without any comments now when i walk into a bar the bouncers all nod to my immeasurable drivatude women flock to my arms and drinks are always on the house i guess the next step is owning a car to drive but lets not rush it
first off ive never been able to find a thai place in staten island or ever been to one in brooklyn that isnt overpricedtrendyupscale that i liked which also delivers etc so one day i passed by a grand opening sign on hylan blvd i love thai food to the fullest however im very picky when it comes to the taste the pad thai has to be just right and spicy the mee krob has to be just sweet but not overbearing the tom kha gai must not be too thick and sour the curry puffs couldnt be too spicy or plain etc after many attempts of trying out thai food in brooklyn mostly around bay ridgebensonhurst everything has disappointed me to an extent then when talay opened i knew it had to be it ive been craving for some tom yum for months i was greeted by the most beautiful girl ive ever seen she was intimidating as much as the decor and ambience of the place was too i felt a little underdressed and scrubby but she made me feel warm and welcome right away the interior design is absolutely chic and beautiful little intricate details all over the place with a mini waterfall by the checkout romantic candle lights white table cloths and bold colorslinespatterns all over the walls doors etc the interior decorator knew was heshe was doing the tom yum lemongrass soup w shrimp or chicken delicious veggies mildly spicy immediately warmed me up oh how i craved for it as im studying the menu i notice the music playing in the background very nice from light rb jazz dance neo soul acid jazz and a lil bit of break beats the music was tasteful the curry puffs chicken potato in yellow curry sauce in a puff pastry were delectable it felt so perfect in my mouth try their khao pad thai fried rice w chicken is delicious my favorite item is the massaman curry potato peanut in sweet tamarind coconut milk curry sauce and the pad thai rice noodles w beansprouts beancurd scallions crushed pepper and chopped peanuts in tamarind sauce with chicken beef shrimp or tofu i always get tofu or chicken and slightly spicy its better spicy lol all of the meals are served on beautiful rectangular platters etc oh yes the thai tea is satisfying why do i like this place so much well the service is out of this world the hostess is such a doll her family ownsruns the place shes very fluent in english so no language barriers people its difficult for an asian like myself to order from thai japanese or chinese places too very precise and will give you honest opinions on the food and suggest wonderful dishes for you she suggested the massaman curry the vibe is great it looks like a trendychic bistro but dont let that scare you off its quite comfortable and enjoyablei think i fell inlove
what an amazing little store on a teeny tiny little alleyway not truly a street in chinatown if you love to cook and particularly thai food this is an incredible find from the most common ingredients you would need to the most obscure bangkok center grocery has it all thaigrocerycomif you need equipment a true sticky rice bamboo steamer and pot say you will find it here kaffir lime leaves lemongrass noodles thai spices you cant pronouce at all whether its in english or not theyre here cheesy decorations and spectacular service with a sweet smile all here make the trip itll be like going on a scavenger hunt playing in an urban maze and feeling like a tourist during the process but youll emerge with treasures in the end
i dont know if johns pie still deserves the hype after all these years but this california boy say yes ive tried a few of those hour local pizza joints and they shouldnt be mentioned in the same sentence with johns and wait what wait the trick is to waltz in here after and you can sit down order a pizza and be out of there in min this gives you just enough time to walk back to blue note for some cool jazz in the second showing the pizza here is best consumed quickly because the ceiling fan is strong which makes the super thin crust cool down fast too fast sigh i dont think i can take another bite of commercial pizza in cali when i return
there are things i absolutely must have when i am in new york a real bagel tasty dlite a fresh kosher pickle from world of pickles you can understand then why i am terribly distraught over the current situation with world of pickles w of p is a tiny storefront on street just west of madison so small you might miss it except for the big barrels of pickles out front i went to get my fix today and lo behold the storefront was still there but no pickle barrels wtf i talked to the owner who is still selling produce yogurt drinks and savory snacks apparently he has had to temporarily cease his pickle sales because he was told that as a restaurant he is required to install a bathroom in his space his space is about feet by feet no joke it is completely ridiculous like adding a bathroom to a lemonade stand i am sad to my very core there is no world of pickles without the pickles its just crazy town without the pickles first no santa and then no pickles its just not fair you can still order them for shipment or delivery he makes about different varieties my favorites are the new pickles fresh cucumbers that have been pickledlite halfsours and hot spicy sours hopefully world of pickles will find a way to do business on street or relocate please stop by and give your support and tell him that you cant wait to try his delicious pickles meanwhile i will miss the oldworld feeling of getting pickles from the barrel on my lunch break this was a sad sad day indeed

went there again today great experience as usual ive been going to paul biase for restorations repairs adjustments purchases appraisals and advice on fine bowed string instruments for the past years now every experience ive ever had there has been outstanding and believe me that is really saying something in the world of nyc string instrument dealersrestorers as a bassist im always looking for the big ol things along with their bows and pauls inventory of these gargantuan instruments is not as overflowing as some shops ive been in but he has there a lot of great bows and instruments and everything he has in the shop is way top quality paul definitely has the proverbial quality over quantity and also to tell you the truth his quantity is nothing really to be sneezed at either within his collection theres not a dud in the batch even for the economically challenged prices on bows and instruments corresponding to their relative qualities from the quite usable to the wetdreamwillsellakidneyfor are extremely fair paul is a straight shooter and a hell of a nice guy who always will make time for you nomatter how busy he might be and will also be patient expert and fair with you after having been dealing with him for so many years i believe that thats just his nature for repairs and restorations youll find none better in manhattan everything paul has ever done for both my year old cremonese and tyrolean basses not to mention my many bows has always been expert and his artistry has always way surpassed my highest professional standards im a bassist but from hearing from my colleagues his work on violins violas and cellos along with their bows is also masterful highly recommended
now that tjs is within range i stopped writing shopping lists my grocery experience has changed greatly for the betteri walk there and think about how hungry am i how hungry will i be about how many items is that hunger then i spin in circles and get really dizzy finally i run through tjs grabbing about that many items and throwing them into my cart trying not to fall downsure its a little risky but everything here is delicious and affordable so it works out pretty well for the most part other than that time i had to eat pesto sauce on carrots for dinner
it amazes me that the negative reviews of this classic nyc landmark tell me all ye negative nelliesyou wouldnt happen to be nonnative nyer would you out of towners whove lived here for a few weeks months years and consider yourself new yorkers now yes its trueyankee stadium is in a not so pretty part of the bronx wellfor nowuntil all the youngins from out of town discover its the last place in the city to get cheap rent and gigantic apartmentseast village and harlem ringing any bells to you yes prices are high but what were you expecting for your bleacher seat a luxury skybox perhaps trashy nyers sweetie say that to my face and ill show you just how trashy i can be yankee stadium is an instution the greats played here new stadium ha i dont want a new stadium i dont want cushioned seats i want to be miles above the stadium feeling like im going to tumble down at any second i want the rumble of the subway going by i want to look out across the stadium at monument park and think about all the history that place holds the world series that have been won and even lost within those mighty walls to all of you naysayers i say sit down shell out your for a beer or is it now and for your tube of meat byproduct in bread colored styrofoam and shut the fk upor better yetgo to a mets game and leave the real fans in peace
everyone has talked about the steak and the tomato and onion so i wont repeat that here i will say that the schlag homemade whipped cream for dessert deserves special mention i think its calories per spoonful and next to impossible to eat after gorging on their steak but it is worth it you need a pound of bills to get a pound of steak there but it is worth itat least once in your life you dont want to regret never having been there
im a vegan except for when i eat ribsthere is nuthin like good ole fashioned southern cookin especially in a gown people often consider me just a champagne and caviar gal but little known fact is my daddys from alabama and i love me some fried chicken catfish pulled pork but especially key lime pie and pies and thighs has and i have investigated every place in ny the best key lime pie i have ever had i do not take this statement lightly and the atmosphere is stunning sit in the dark mildewy yet amazing rock star bar or in cement patio and enjoy the view of the massive cement wall facing you magic pure magic
the trains might have been packed at times the people rude the heat relentless and the travel slow with technical difficulties and constant stops and yet unlike friends lovers cigarettes and all other transient things in life mta never once failed me it was always there for me transferring me from one part of the city to another it was there through the good times when i felt like going out for a cookie through the necessary times when i had to make it to work and through the bad times when i was so drunk i couldnt see straight to get homeim going to miss getting wherever i want to be whenever i want im going to miss standing so close to people i have never met before and eyeing cute boys on the train on sunday afternoons im going to miss the smell of sweat and the old mans groan on early weekday mornings im going to miss gazing at the contemporary art on the windows getting a daily update on the latest fashions of the city up close and personal and im going to miss the roar of the machine the underground giant that keeps new york city runningyep im definitely going to miss mta as well as of course beloved new york
love the ambiance here i went with chicks and a dude wasnt that a movie in the possibly skinimax so it wasnt a date night or anything but it was romantic as all hell we were seated in the cellar which in no way is a it puts the lotion in the basket kind of room but more of a spanish wine cellar with candlelight to boot my seabass was awesome and the cheese and charcuterie plate was incredibleand huge all wine suggestions were excellent and our waiter was so cute i could have eaten him if i wasnt so full from the cheese plate even if you are not a brooklynite it is a great excuse for an excursion over the bridge
i just realized that my old review for gramercy is now worthless the menu has changed since then and my experience with the place is different somehow over the last few years ive become a lunch regular at gramercy i know a lot of peoples names there and about their lives and when i get seated at one of the tables along the wall i feel like curling up as if i were at homeim not sure how this happened because im really not there that often because i cant afford to be there that often but gramercy tavern is just that amazing its homey while still being classy elegant without being pretentious the service is excellent and the food is delicioustwo tips if youre going at dinner dont fill up on the bread the fish is good but the meat is betterif i had the money id be here every week
this place must be related to chuck norris because it kicks so much ass bierkraft has an astonishing array of foreign beer and microbrews not to mention a wide selection of cheeses and sweets it represents all that is good
just so everyone in san francisco doesnt think im a stingy pizza reviewing beeatch ill pen an ode to the best pizza man ever my hero the one and only domenico demarco the proprietor of difaras on avenue j smack dap in the center of brooklyndom is amazing and at almost years old he hand makes every single pie at difaras today just the way he has for almost years he uses tomatoes he imports himself from his home region in italy he sprinkles each pie with a combo of three high quality cheese regular semi hard mozzarella fresh mozzarella and parmesan he make two kinds of pies square and regular he offers only a few toppings and they are prepared to order when you order a sausage slice he or a helper goes to the back and slices sausage for your pizza the special toppings are artichoke and porcini mushroom dom claims to import these things himself they are expensive but when you order an artichoke slice you have more artichokes than pizza on your plate and its worth every penny my presonal favorites are sausage nice and fennelly and the peppersonionsmushroom combo i also always get at least one square and one regular and have been known to eat slices in one visitgoing to difaras is like making a pilgrimage since its only dom making pies its a slow process he makes every pie to order and hes so busy that the pies for slices dont last long so every slice is almost fresh out of the oven the slowness really gets to some people but i love it it means that i get to watch dom work and that is a beautiful thing he is a master at his craft he creates every pie with love and tenderness he moves with grace and harmony watching him make pizza is like watching art in motion dom knows all his regulars he even remembered me after a nine month absensce when i told him i went to africa he asked me if i ate pizza in africa when i said yes he said well probably not like this and he was right when i said i was moving to california he said thats too bad he heard that they dont have good pizza there and so far hes right

i remember when my aunt took me to the windows on the world restaurant on top of the north tower for my birthday when i was a teen in the late and then many years later i stayed at the marriott adjacent to the towers about two months prior to for a business trip that could have happened anytime that fall both memories stay with me and make me reflect how fleeting life can be take advantage of the time you have now because you never know what turn your life may make

wow how could i have waited this long to yelp about one of my alltime favorite restaurants i love gam mee ok you wont find better suhlungtang oxtail soup cooked in a huge vat for hours to get the flavor served with rice thin slices of beef rice noodles then you add scallions pepper and salt to your own liking anywhere in this country even the natives from korea know about this place it is that famous suhlungtang so soothing and perfect esp when its cold outside if youre feeling under the weather its the equivalent of chicken soup for koreans or hung overmost people ive taken to get suhlungtang here love it minus a few friends that i give them constant shit for but they also love the other items on the menu too gam mee ok is definitely known for the soup but the bibimbop bindaeduk korean pancakes and beef tartare platters are also awesome but what i crave is their kimchee pickled cabbage and radish i have no idea what they do to it but it is the best we koreans will put a bunch into our soup as well for a nice spicy flavor and add some texture yummmmm it probably doesnt sound good by my description but trust me you gotta taste it for yourself to believe it
badass fact about ibbys falafel their falafel kicks ass and the claim below that this is the best falafel this side of the hudson isnt technically wrong but theres more a food personage no less than robert sietsema of the village voice claims that ibbys and i quote blows macdougal street out of the water ahem badass fact about ibbys falafel theyre open until midnight this is nothing to sneeze at in downtown jc badass fact about ibbys falafel they sell tshirts which have jersey city emblazoned across the back so you can represent and wear your jc pride
the last time i tried to eat a sandwich bigger than my head i woke up in a cold sweat chewing on my pillow when you are lucid and you think you are up to the challenge go to carnegie for their paean to meat more stacked than anna nicole smith in her prime any sandwich on the menu will twist your cap back it will also twist your wallet back since most sandwiches start around and get up to do the math before you write this off this is easily a twoperson meal unless you are a transit cop that being the case its just an appetizer seriously check my picture of the chicken salad sandwich with bacon i think it weighed pounds and i had to eat it with a fork maybe i can file workers comp for throwing my back out trying to lift the thing to my face the counter guys are cool and if you know any spanish it might go a long way towards getting slices of bacon instead of the that a normal sucker gets muy bueno jctsfr
i love this place pomme frittes and red wine galore the food is delicious get ready to sit very close to some strangers big place but youre packed in like sardines excellent food great scene plenty of other people waiting at the bar with you for a table very very loud with such an extensive menu there will be plenty of items for you to choose from great place for brunch lunch or dinner date rating pick up scale strong suggestions warm goat cheese caramelized onion tart chicken paillard house made fettuccini roasted beet salad roasted pork medallions sour cream hazelnut waffles scrambled eggs in pasty puff sooo many good things to choose from funny story a friend of mine one night was with me and attempted to pick a little blonde vixen sitting at the table next to us she was very sexy i must agree with him on his taste but haha hello it seemed like she was on a date come to find out they were married of course my friend had no idea until the man said that he had stalked the woman for years and in order to prevent her from obtaining a restraining order he married her best way apparently to follow a woman make a note guys okay maybe it wasnt that funny but she squeezed through the tables with her bottom facing us which simply confirms how close together the tables are and that married women are trouble makers too
miracle hair workers these women seriously saved my hairheres the story one day i decide id try and dye my hair black i bought semiperament stuff at the store and wasnt worried about it because it was my understanding that it would wash out i think you know where this is goingit looked awful like i was a goth kid with black straw all over my head after repeated attempts to wash it out i called the number on the back of the box the lady on the other end seriously seemed pleased with my misery she said honey if you dye it darker it dont wash outi freaked out the worst part is that my natural hair color is gorgeous brown with natural reddish tints i called salons in the phone book alphabetically desperate for an answer id never even heard of color correction but figured at least someone would dye my hair a less hideous colori called alices and they gave me an appointment that day alice was actually there shes so cool by the way anyways i still dont know how they did it but they completely got the dye out of my hair they restored my natural color without totally frying my hair i was so happy and grateful it was ridiculous these women and men are phenomenal

claude is a snarly old man but one fateful night while he slept angels must have slipped into his home through the window and covered his hands with their light silvery angel kisses in short the man knows what butter is and how to use it when you come in claude will probably scowl at you as he rings up your purchase he will do everything in his power to make you feel like you should be buying more than you are frankly hes right you should be buying more than you are because these pastries are some of the best in the world the patisserie looks unremarkable from the outside and there is no defined vibe to the clientele the first time i came here there was a businessman at one table and a hobo at the other and the second time i came here there were a couple of preteen boys clutching skateboards this is not a hipster place or a foodie place its just an amazing place with amazing baked goods the plain croissants are unspeakably delicious as every review of claude will tell you if they sell out before you get there try a croissant with almond filling in my opinion theyre friendlier and more complex than the somewhat overpoweringly sweet pain au chocolat the coffee is cheap and hot and a pretty decent excuse to make a visit to claude your first errand in the morning beware if you have claudes eclairs with a date there is a strong possibility that your date will become confused and fall in love with you based solely on the fact that he or she associates you with the eclairs these pastries are powerful stuff use them wisely

when hes not touring you will find chris odonnell here not the actor but the phenomenal artist chris odonnell i didnt preface artist with tattoo because he is a lot more than that if you get a chance to see his nonbody artwork you will understand unlike most artists of his caliber he is not a pretentious asshole definitely one of the most down to earth cats you will ever meet his japanese designs are some of the illest ive ever seen on anyone outside the yukuza dope enough for me to really consider color designs but with my skin tone i prefer to stick with black and negative space hes not heavy handed and if your body language says you need a break he will ask any place he hangs his hat has got to be quality so starscheck his wallet i guarantee it has bad mother fucker stitched on it
i had to delete my old review for the old location because the new location is just a whole different world right now its still got that crisp newshop smell and when i walked in down the steps to the shining sleek wellair conditioned shop floor i think my eyes light up like a kid in a candy store the space is just lovely for one thing perfectly laid out with lots of freedom to move around and peer at labels without getting in anyones way and the selection oh my goodness im not much of a wineaux yet so my attention was focued on their selection of liquors and wow wow boozes i have never seen before or heard of only in legend i had always been disappointed in the really slim selection of gins at warehouse wines and spirits but astors got the really nice stuff that my fellow martini hounds have told me to keep an eye out for while on the subject of warehouse ill just say that if youre in the market for say a gigantic plastic jug of brandy or a box wine which damn it sometimes you are aint no shame in it okay maybe a little shame go there since its top shelf stuff at astor except for the little selection of wines they have off to one side and okay they have box wine but its nice box wine before i wax on too long ill just say that astor center is a lovely place through and through i selected a wine from one of their house picks and hugely enjoyed it astor center has free tastings every thursday friday and saturday and they are ever so worth it ive definitely become a regular fixtureif you come around on a thursday night youll probably run into me and my best friend slurping up free wine and pretending we know what were talking about if you come during one where it is the actual manufacturer of the booze they will give you more than a healthy pour a couple of weeks ago they had a tasting of highquality mezcals and boy i was glad it wasnt a long walk home after that tasting
aka the hasidic bra store not because the bras are hasidic but because the owner and his mother are the patriarch opened the store in the and it remains a throwback to old skool new yorkwhen you walk into the store ralph or magda will tell you your size by sight without using a tape measure if its cold out theyll ask you to open your coat the size they tell you will probably not be the size youre wearing when my friend patricia disagreed with magdas assessment she said thats why you droop you want to droopsince ralph is orthodox he will not touch the customers the fitting is done by his wife his mother or their one employee the dressing room is essentially a sheet hung from a pole dont expect magda to be gentle she knows how a bra is supposed to fit thats not where the nipples go she told my friend exasperated shoving her breast in correctlyand shes right the bra fits perfectly you have complete support and the nipples are in the right placeanother friend complained that the strap on the back of her bra was too tight the response thats not the bras fault but with sizes up to h and i odds are good theyll have your sizebest of all orchard is a discount store so youll end up paying about half what you would at an upscale location no entertainment tax

im not a wine kind of guy partially because wine is so expensive but also because i feel like an idiot when people start waxing philosophical about oh the undertones of black currant and summer apricot lends to the oaky finish all i can taste is red or white i guess my palette just aint as fine tuned as others so buying expensive wines always felt like putting premium unleaded into your rusty chevy nova it wont know the difference enter trader joes wines store finally a place that isnt pretentious and tries to sell you a bottle of rothschild for an office party the wine here is on average really good and really good value i first started off with the buck chuck charles shaw and was pleasantly surprised that is didnt taste like paint thinner dont get me wrong it didnt taste like the best wine i had ever had either but it wasnt near as bad as other cheap wines i have partaken in totally drinkable i have since moved all around the map my favorites are the barefoot chardonnay the french market series and the double magnum thats bottles kids amarone while i may not be a wine connoisseur i am gradually improving my tastes and everyday i get closer to tasting undertones of black currant

sometimes all too rarely you have a dining experience that makes you remember what youre missing the rest of the time this is a tale of delight it is all true this is my story last night susan and i had selected a restaurant on irving place with a beautiful garden as our dining venue but due to a fortunate as it turned out series of missed phone calls by the time we were ready to go the daylight hours were waning and i suggested a new restaurant on east street id just read about it was you know hot out and as they are wont to do for inscrutable sanitational reasons the fine garbage men and women of new york had elected not to pick up the stinking putrid sacks of trash that had been piled high on the sidewalks for days but i digress this is no way to open my first fivestar review lets begin again in honor of the high heat susan and i donned our best summer dresses and heels and tottered down to east street no wait strolled we strolled down because thats more elegant isnt it five stars should be dignified after all upon our arrival at fork knife we were greeted by zoe the most gracious australian barmaid this side of up over who asked if we had reservations well no we replied all too casually there were plenty of unoccupied tables and it was nearly eight oclock already we had our location of choice the table for two in front of the doors thrown wide to the summer evening all picked out i prepared to tell zoe which table we had selected ah what folly she informed us with true regret that they were fully booked that night and that as the chef prepared only a certain amount of food each evening there was no way they could fit us in our faces fell our stomachs growled our dream receded we accepted our fate however and sat down at the gleaming natural wood slab bar to drown our sorrows and regroup the menu included a wine by the glass called knife and fork which as you will recall is the very name of the restaurant i asked if the owner was also a wine maker but it turns out that the name is merely a happy coincidence we had to try it im not a big chardonnay fan particularly if its of the california ilk if i want that much oak ill just eat the tree but this was australian and quite lovely as we savored it zoe pleaded our case again with the chefowner irishman damien brassel asking if he would let us eat if there were a cancellation no absolutely not rules are rules and well hed lose credibility as a chef if he werent capricious we were not yet prepared to leave our beautiful and tragic surroundings however we marveled at the attention to detail the impeccably shaped wine glasses imported from france in a range of sizes to properly support various wine varietals the wideplank wood floor the beadedglass lamp shades suspended from the ceiling the highdesign silverware also imported from europe we each ordered another glass and continued to chat with zoe and then well the chef must have seen the sadness that had settled in our eyes even his iron heart and skillet could not withstand this unsettling loss of hope because miraculously two plates of herbcrusted salmon appeared before us now the bounty of the sea has never been my thing but oh the salmon sashimi style coated with fresh italian parsley and dill laid upon a slash of creme fraiche and garnished with fresh baby lettuce you couldnt buy fish this fresh susan said you have to bewhispered connected please tell the chef we are most grateful i told the waiter and that we found the salmon extraordinary he indicated that this verbal feedback would be unecessary signaling to our plates stripped of all evidence scraped bare many unreserved parties entered throughout the evening all were turned away we ordered a third glass of wine to celebrate our good fortune but bounty has a way of multiplying and so before long a fresh tomato consume was sent out to us in fabulous oblong teacups pure distilled essence of tomato i closed my eyes and gave silent thanks when our chef at last determined that we simply would not go away he relented zoe told us we could be seated at the table we had mentally chosen so long before victory was ours i ordered the ready torchon of foie gras with saffron poached pineapple and coriander passion fruit and vanilla reduction and since the chefs gifts were endless he also included a second variety of foie gras not on the menu on the plate and since we had already had the tomato consomme he insisted we consume the seared scallop for balance theres more but im exhausted i know you are too so i wont take any more of your time youll simply have to try it yourself the menu changes frequently but make a reservation for the love of god and wear your trousers with the expandable waist

like many yelpers have stated the place is design heavy i was walking by one day and something about the cafe drew me in was it the cute boy sitting by his laptop sipping on a cappuccino or was it the cute dog waiting outside for its owner or that i had to use the bathroom very badly well its all three haha in a rush this was the only place i could think of stepping into but i was whisked away by the interior design the colors the furniture the whole aura of the place intoxicated me as im waiting to use the facilities im sitting in a sweet orangecolored leather couch which took me into another land of tranquility its a view of a small little garden they have in their backyard oh how pretty and its my turn now when i stepped out im faced with a snakelike line of customers waiting for their delicious food and coffee i took a menu and examined it next to the cute boy w the laptop he recommended the veggie reuben and boyyyyyyyyy i love reubens like its all i order at delis and diners i nibbled on the sandwich and enjoyed the atmosphere until my tranquil state of mind was shattered by the sound of screaming children and mommies but it was worth the experience i love this place

my good friend jon has been raving about this place since it was located in new jersey first off i live in san francisco so when i finally got that chance to go to nyc this was the first place i went with my friend needless to say it lived up to every expectation i ever hadit might be different from any other pizza youve ever had but once you read the pamphlet and understand what anthony is going for youll realize that youll never find pizza quite like this anywhere else simply put they only offer the freshest best ingredients and the pies are in limitied supply theres only four choices on the menu but theyre all amazing whatever you do dont question whats on the menu asking for pepperoni will probably get you tossed out on the curb at close to a pie its a bit on the expensive side but trust me its worth itif i was independently wealthy id fly across country just to taste this pizza again
amazing pizza lots of different fresh imported cheeses freshe herbs delicious sauce sooooooo good the downsides a long wait but fun to watch the owner dominic make pizzas and not get stressed out about the fact that there are people staring at him waiting the place looks like a dump and its hot as hell in there so get it to go it will be much more enjoyable if youre not sweating your ass off with that said definitely worth the trip and worth the wait

my new favorite coffee shop and i dont even drink coffee they have a nice loose tea selection one of the great spaces to hang out and study in but theres also plenty of folks chitchatting and an eclectic mix constantly streaming forth from the ipod as well as live music thurs eves so dont go seeking total quiet the food is good but not great but the prices are very reasonable so if you need a quick snack with your beverage it aint bad they also are going to open a cool sodafountain area with floats and egg creams and all that stuff which will be cool if you ask even now you can get your pie ala mode though open until midnight every night

i love sandwiches i dont mean that i enjoy eating them once in a while when i say i love sandwiches it means that i would heartily enjoy eating a sandwich morning noon and night until i could no longer chew and swallow on my own and with the aid of a blender and a bendy straw perhaps even after that if i had to decide a place to get these many sandwiches from without any hesitation at all i would choose parisis bakery on mott st in nolita i held an internship a block away from parisis and every day i would scour the neighborhood in search of cheap but good food did this anomaly exist i am pleased to tell you reader that it does indeed upon discovering parisis i was an instant addict i had a sandwich almost every day parisis sandwiches are no ordinary sandwiches they are veritable behemoths comprised of a huge fresh crusty italian hero sized loaf sparkling lettuce and meaty tomatoes top notch condiments including homemade roasted red peppers which are to die for and sliced to order cold cuts and cheese which are extravagantly tasty all of these ingredients come together in a symphony of flavors to delight the most discerning palates of course each sandwich is completely customizeable it would be completely okay to get a sandwich stuffed sky high with purely roast beef if you so desired they dont only serve cold sandwiches oh no they have plenty of hot sandwiches as well like vast steaming hot egg pepper omelete sandwiches and meatball and chicken parm sandwiches with sauce that rivals your italian grandmothers seriously theyve got tons of homemade spreads if youre in the mood for that and fresh mozzerella and roasted red peppers is an excellent vegetarian option all of these delicious items are created by warm and friendly servers highly trained in the art of sandwiches who treat their customers like their own family and customers they have in abundance get there around and you will be standing on a line that wraps around the tiny interior of the store and clear out the door get there quick though they usually close around or so the best part these massive delectable sandwiches are mostly and will take the better part of an hour to finish what are you waiting for stop drowning in your own drool and go get a freaking sandwich
living in manhattan for a few years now it seems that anything tour related would be torture for me but much to my surprise it wasntmy dad who had never been to manhattan was visiting from back home and wanted to see the city with sooo many options to choose from the super saver combo seemed like something that would kill a lot of time and cover a lot of ground and was flexible enough for both of us our first tour was the uptown loop which looped from just west of times square all the way up through harlem by the famous apollo and back down the east side of town passing museum mile and returned to the original starting point on and there was very little traffic for us at the time that we were passengers which was nice but the following day we hopped on over near the metropolitan museum of art and it was solid gridlock all the way down avenue man that sure made the tour longer which is when you thank the lord that you can just hop right off that big red busthey honestly call it a hop on hop off tour for a reason you really should get off of this bus it is soooo convenient these bright red buses really do show up every minutes depending on traffic and if you look closely at the stops on the map there is a sign that reads tour marking the spot where they let you hop on or hop off of the double decker busif you know anything about ny traffic at all you will be much happier with this method of touring because sometimes traffic can get to be entirely too much which is when you hop off and walk aroundromance factor you can tour at your leisure without a huge cab bill hopon hopoffhobnob potential everyone is friendly theyre on vacaydestination rating if you hop on a bus and the tour guide is annoying hop off and try the next one it depends on your interests and your sense of humor but there seems to be a variety of styles among the guides and some in my opinion are far more personable and better than others make sure you tip the ones that are better o
this has got to be the place to go with a huge group of very hungry meatloving people everything and i mean everything is all you can eat but this is not your typically shabby clean the plates off and put the food back out onto those steam tables kind of place this is quality food and a ton of it you can start out with the salad bar which has a ton of variety and everything is is very fresh the only downside is if you eat too much of it youll have no room for whats next the meat they bring out almost every cut of beef you could want and chicken legs and turkey wrapped in bacon and sausage and lamb andso much meat i cant remember it all in front of you there is a chip one side is red the other is greenthe waiters will bring you meat and continue to bring you meat as long as your chip is green they walk around the room with giant pieces of succulent perfectlycooked meat thats just oozing with flavor and theyre not just carrying it around on a platter its on a giant swordwhat could be cooler you ask ill tell youthe fact that they slice it with giant knives now i know what youre thinkinghow could this be safegiant sword giant knife a lost limb well i assure you it is because theyre probably trained in the art of meat swordery and i still have all my appendages i recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves meat wants to eat meat and can eat a lot ofmeat fast for a couple of days beforehand with all the friends youre bringing then go pig outthink of it as a bonding experience
i gorged myself silly wow is all i can say after having a hearty and soulful meal here i went with only one friend and we finished off the following something like creole shrimp fried green tomatoes chili with tortilla chips rack o ribs cornbread potato salad baked beans and mac n cheese to top it off we had the banana creme pudding dessert lets just say it felt like they melted a whole pack of krafts singles into the mac n cheese thats not a complaint either the potato salad was heavy too if i had to eliminate anything from our gluttonfest it wouldve been the po salad and chili not because they werent good but because of survival of the tastiest the appetizers if you order the solo portions are not that big a solo fried green tomato order comes with the creole shrimp came with about pieces and the chili was enough for about people the chili comes with a layer of melted cheese a sour cream dollop on top and warm beef and bean chili sitting underneath it all think the size of a cup of soup i couldve conquered the rack o ribs if i didnt order the other stuff that should give you an idea of the portion size the dessert wouldve been good if only i was a banananatic the total bill pretty damn good for two people who have stomachs the size of toilet bowls
hands down the best japanese bbq restaurant in nyc the modern decor friendly service excellent beef trendy location and relaxing atmosphere makes this restaurant perfect for social events gyukaku is a popular chain from japan that gained its fame from their reasonably priced beef and delicious japanese steak sauce you can find the sauce at any japanese supermarket at about a bottle their american chains in hawaii la and new york are more upscale with fancier decor full bar and higher grade beef selection the picture filled menu provides perfect guide to the restaurants delicacies follow the osusume symbol i highly recommend their gyutan us kobe kalbi melts in your mouth mixed mushrooms luxurious mix of shiitake enoki oyster mushrooms etcsaikou and original bibimba in sizzling stone pot however the portion for each order is quite small six slices or so so make sure your wallet is prepared to take some damage the service is always excellent the servers are very helpful and they change your grill plate often that you wont need to grill on top of the burnt grease the smoke ventilation on the grill rim is definitely another big plus especially since there are so many night hot spots in the area that you would want to hit afterward

vintage reconstruction generally means blazers with the seams ripped open tshirts cut and sewn into tank tops or perhaps wool skirts stenciled with funky designs thanks to urban outfitters realizing that it was cheaper to buy clothes at goodwill than it was to buy new fabric its far less common to find reconstructed vintage clothing that looks like itself only better or like something new entirely and so i was thrilled to find some odd rubies the selection was largely dresses and they were exquisite for example a cotton housedress with decorative seamwork added and its nipped waist relaxed for a more wearable style or what had obviously been a shapeless jersey dress transformed into something drapey luxurious and almost stella mccartneyesque my personal favorite was a dress with its neckline lowered and empire waistband embellished for an almostfamous rockstarsgirlfriend look think burberry prorsums fall collection many of the dresses are displayed with necklaces on the hangers for additional inspiration in creating an outfit theres a rack or two of newer designers but they were unmemorable compared to the reconstructed pieces i seem to recall prices being in the region but ill obviously just have to go back this weekend and check

drinking beer in the sun is one of our inalienable rights as americans maybe not explicitly the forefathers couldnt put it in the declaration of independence or the constitution because they wouldve looked like a bunch of wighappy booze goons but its there in the subtext inextricably tied to the pursuit of happiness drinking beer at the boat basin made me happy it was a sunday afternoon looking out at the boats going by on the choppy hudson and i was just sitting and having a drink and some conversation with friends i had the seared tuna wrap appetizer which was pretty good it came with a mild wasabi sauce that added a little kick and was the striking green of a mcdonalds shamrock milkshake this is not a place you go for the food mind you but its good to have it there to soak up some of the happiness you are drinking in considering the location the prices werent that bad beers were and the entrees were in the range the waitress was efficient if not overly friendly she was also very honest when asked about the nachos she stated emphatically dont get them they are awful another protected right freedom from awful nachos
i think this is one of the finest museums devoted to contemporary art anywhere the renovated space is spectacular navigating your way through the crowds on a friday evening can be daunting but its worth it to save the hefty admission price
i couldnt have made a better choice than spending the entirity of the last night of my first visit to nyc at spuyten duyvil it was pretty empty when i arrived i was on my own so i sat down at the bar and surveyed the menu finding few things i recognized even the usual list of trappistes was incomplete you can get chimay anywhere the bartender explained the owner wants rare beers that you wont be able to find anywhere else they had six beers on tap none of which id ever heard of and they offered me samples of the four i was interested in before i settled on a pint of weyerbacher black hole while i was there one of the taps ran out and the owner went downstairs and decided what he wanted to put on tap next their taps regularly rotate so if theres one youre interested in you should try it before its gone over the course of the evening the place filled with regulars many of them asked if dan the bartender was there but he was not if this dan is better than the bartenders i did have this place would need a sixth star the service was fantastic their beer descriptions and comparisons extensive and their recommendations spot on are your stouts dark a customer asked the bartender kinda smiled patiently explained a few things about beer and helped the customer make a selection i chatted with the regular sitting to my right for awhile i wasnt a beer drinker until i started coming to this place its really opened my eyes to the world of what beer can be i told him what id tried so far and my tastes and he also recommended a couple of great beers he left with one of the two woman he had been talking to on his other side so apparently the place is good for that too are you here for the poetry open mic another regular asked observing me writing on my note cards i want to be believed violently he told everyone later the jukebox was as eclectic as everything else about the place they might be giants lots of jazz and the butthole surfers are three things i never would have expected to find in the same jukebox if i lived near this place i would live at this place

i love this place when i am in manhattan i make sure to stop by nobu instead of calling ahead of time they will always be booked i have been able to get in the same evening just by calling in the lobster salad is a musteat is worth it the dressing has a really nice kick to it the lobster is cooked perfectly i always have cravings for it and always order it when im there i ordered the following which have all been superb sea bass w mushrooms squid pasta miso black cod rock shrimp tempura i also ordered other kinds of fish you just cant go wrong w fish here they cook it perfectly and have the best sauces to compliment each dish i dont remember what else i ordered and tried to look for the menu online to spark my memory i dont order sushi here as their entrees and appetizers seem to be there specialty and you cant get anywhere else they need to open one in northern california plus i can have amazing sushi back home that is just as fresh dessert wise i ordered the bento box chocolate lava cake w green tea ice cream it was pretty good but ive had better check out culinary insitute of america napa for the best lava cake the drinks are really good i ordered the mango martini it was strong on the alcohol but not overpowering you could taste the fresh mango juice i loved the extra dried mango they put on the glass yummy funny thing is the miso soup sucked they needed to put more miso in it tasted watered down its ok miso soup isnt why i went to nobu this place is bank but what more would you expect out of a restaurant like nobu it is worth the price in my opinion be sure to ask for permission to take pictures here haha d i absolutely love the decor of the place
deeeeeelicious my favorite restaurant in the city yes my absolute favorite the mac that virgils serves is by far the most outstanding satisfying dish of fromage and pasta on this isle that you will find and believe you me ive tried a lot in search of the ultimate bowl it will make you weak in the knees i promise and its only as a side the wings are also a delectable fancy but please if you are afraid of getting down and dirty with your food this is not the place for you if you dont want your breathburps reeking of spice rub bbq the next day dont eat here its only for those who demand a full rounded flavor in their bbq butterworth style flatdogs to a full rack of ribs virgils has a wide selection for any appetite the portions are more than adequate and the flavors are more than fantastic again virgils is one of my absolute favorites in the city and a cant miss in my book did i mention their mac p yeah its that good
ive gotten the best haircuts of my life at the beehive ask for bean or luisa if you want the queen bees of the hive but all the gals are rockin this place is dog friendly and not too cool for school read everyone actually acts nice not aloof and unapproachablei got compliments on my hair for weeks after it was cut there of course i think i may have walked around tossing my head to and fro like a show pony but literally everyone loved iti should post a pic of the haircut but that seems a bit overly narcissistic so i wont they do cut color and extensions as well recently theyve opened up the beehive beauty parlor on leonard st nearby and do pedicures facials etc etcbring a photo of what you like and tip well
my favorite coffee house in new york city gracious staff delicious healthy foods yummy freetrade coffeeand they take credit cards which is a big deal for me
four of us feasted on the corn and no one cared that we were all squirting each other in the face as we chowed down what kind of cheese do they use and what is that red powder i dunno but i dont care either yum nobody can be upset while theyve got these kernels on their taste buds if everyone in new york walked around eating this corn all day it would be a calm and lovefilled city im convinced of that corn poll do you prefer to eat it all the way across in a row typewriterstyle or do you finish one end of the cob all the way around before moving on toward the middle just curious
for a long time nyc was my drug i broke the habit here one night many years ago when i decided to leave the city in favor of california this is a place that holds a special bit of nostalgia for me and thats what it seems it would be best for anyway
fontanas rocks relatively new kid on the block but boy what a kid its huge inside bars and they have a pool table to boot the super fly lookout balcony lets you check out the whole scene as the night gets going happy hour is relatively quiet but the bartenders are so nice that the last time i was there it was all of a sudden packed and go figure back to the rocking part there is a definite theme going here of the muscle car and unbuttoned shirt variety
i recommend shopping here with just the slightest buzz going the store is jammed full of stuff so cool one contemplates tossing ones wardrobe and starting over as a punk or a rasta or even one of those emo sensitive euro guys only having one suitcase to fill i settled for a sports coat a hat and a handful of shirts for under bucks

ill come cleanthis is my friends restaurant but id also tell him it sucked if it did luckily it doesnt using mostly local ingredients from small purveyors picket fence serves comfort food to fill your belly buttermilk fried chicken bacon sandwich turkey meatloafdinner lunch or brunch its all good and dont miss the back patio during the warm weather great spot for a cold beer and a snack
for us brooklynites this is the equivalent to the union square greenmarket complete with enthusiastic farmers applesellers and the lot its open nearly every saturday of the year and is especially bountiful in fall and spring go there as an outing or for your local produce then hang out in prospect park followed up by a trip to the brooklyn museum or library and youve got a great day ahead of you i like the stand that sells local fish caught off a boat in long island and the people who sell plants grown in the bronx if you live near park slope prospect heights crown heights or flatbush avenue theres no reason you shouldnt be shopping at this greenmarket
by far the best chocolate in the city delectable chocolates are literally flown in from paris daily their hot chocolate is to die forlike drinking a candy bar pricey but that is probably for the best since an unsuspecting first time customer could find themselves suddenly in the throws of a full blown addiction

landmarc is my very favorite restaurant ever if you want to get laid by me that is you will take me here its contemporary french bistro with some italian influences the wine program truly sets it apart large list of full and half bottles that are barely marked up in price and a knowledgeable staff so no paying for a bottle you know costs have them leave the list with you so you can marvel at the many options and strategize i always have a steak either hangar or skirt with chimichurri sauce and fries i say i am going to try a new entree each time but the steak always wins landmarc serves a variety of cuts and sauces so you can freely mix and match hangar strip skirt filet mignon rib eye or grilled portobello pairs with green peppercorn shallot bordelaise dijonnaise chimichurri butter maitre dhotel bearnaise its like granimals but with french food i also love to share the mussels as an appetizer with similar sauce pairing options and then share the dessert sampler with all menu items anyone who knows me knows i hate to share so not only is landmarc wonderful but i grow as a person when i am there the decor is cool and modern upstairs they have a batcave vip room that i have never sat in but i aspire the bar downstairs is small so if its crowded you may find yourself moving around to let the staff through landmarc only takes reservations for groups of to so go early or prepare to wait luckily the wait is worth it
this place should receive stars first of all to all you ladies who wonder where the men are they are here eating in large groups feeding themselves before hitting the clubs to prey on you beat out the competition and take a small group of girls here and youll probably be striking up conversations with the guys at the table over okay back to the review the room is gorgeous with the low tiledceiling bartenders make excellent martinis while you wait and the service here is impeccable when our table was ready the host correctly took my cocktail and carried it to my table for me he led my date and i to the perfect private table so that we would not be overwhelmed by the larger groups of men dining about ladies again take note be smat wolfgang has obviously taken his professional namesake service to his own venture our waiter was extremely knowledgable about wines and food we had an excellent barolo i wish i could remember the exact kind first couse included some of the freshest oysters i have ever had on the half shell next up some lobster cocktail oh lord just when i think it cant get any better the perfect porterhouse is brilliantly displayed and served to me the wait staff sliced the steak up to show off the perfect mediumrare color pinkishred on the inside with no blood dripping from it splayed on the side of the hot platter to allow the juices to sizzle and then placed on my own plate for me to attack now i have been to plenty of steakhouses and this porter goes down in history as the best i have ever sunk my carnivore teeth into if you like a good piece of meat and excellent service head to wolfgangs masterpiece

there was a time when the east village and lower east side in general was an ethnically diverse but socially unified area of new yorkif you lived in alphabet city you also worked hard in a variety of menial jobs came back to the hood tired but then sat on the stoops with your friends and family hanging out on the street shooting the sht watching the kids run around and of course eating the variety of cheap ethnic foods offered in the five block areathese times are long gone and in the nineties the hood lost most of its ethnic characters and a lot of its community aspects where replaced by lonely but still hard working individuals who spent most of their time working to pay off their incredible rents but slowly new islands of community have appeared replacing the old ones with new energy and excitement and one of them is ciao for nowthe ciao offers great treats from the skilled hands of amy and her crew who toil hard to sustain the little community of artists singles momsdads and kids who relish the little cafe on streets homey atmosphere and delicious eatsthis community is definitely centered around the good pastries the excellent coffee and teas the salty treats all made without the pretensions of a balthazar but with the care and loving of a neighborhood matriarchs handsthis is a place where everybody knows your name but also a place where you are welcomed even if like me you are from brooklynif you get a chance to stop by the ciao dont hesitateyou will find some of the friendliest folks and some of the best foods in the area in an environment which is adult kid centricand while you are there tell them that sebas sent youah ah maybe i will get another sugar cookie out of itciao
if your an absolute reggae freak and a pure vinyl junkie and kind of a snob about both of the aforementioned departments of life this is your spot im an above average reggae fan and record collector but the purity of this high grade specialty reggae record store was intense enough to almost kill me i was hurrying from a chinatown bakery back to the recording studio where i was working when it caught my eye and i had to go in but immediately i knew it was dangerous if i hadnt handed over c notes to my dentist that morning i could have been seduced into parting with one of them here and walking out the door with a handful of obscure reggae or singles and an album nobodys ever heard of which could have made me feel like a smarty pants selectress in some restaurant where nobody cared if youre a professional reggae dj you probably know about this place already and if youve ever loved record stores just walking in will give you that magical feeling the website is just as overwhelming but at least youre in the safety of your own home the dude jeremy who i spoke to goes to jamaica six times a year to buy i think that deserves to be supported
this is my favorite place in the world and i am not just saying that the tattoo work is of the highest quality why else would i commit an entire body suit to troy and of the cleanest standards in the industry the gallery always has amazing shows of some of the most talented artists currently working the staff are possible the nicest people this side of the masondixon line seriously very inviting envirnment it is a must for any one interested in tattooing or art
theres nothing like sitting on a plane for hours to make my body ache so as my flight is making its final descent into the new york area im already dreaming of chinatown massage now if youre expecting a fancyschmancy spa with essential oils and enya playing in the background youre in for a rude awakening this place is a dimly lit basement room with about massage tables no frills but it is a clean and orderly locale what it lacks in decor and privacy it more than makes up for with its strong massages holy crapola batman the power in those hands and arms just working away at all my crazy knots and kinks hurts soooooo good i walk out of there in a daze and ready to float away the pricing is odd in a chuckleworthy way minutes minutes minutes minutes minutes cash only
couldnt decide what to get so i asked the waiter to just make it up every piece is served with the perfect balance of shoyu and wasabi so save your barbarous mixing and dipping nonsense put it in your mouth and the sushi literally melts in your mouth like buttah my friends havent had it this good since a am sushi throwdown at the tsukiji fish market in japan back in
this will always be my favorite manhattan restaurant because my husband proposed to me here it has a beautiful romantic atmosphere and the service is excellent its difficult to recommend specific dishes because the menu changes frequently but everything we had was delicious ladies get your guys to bring you here and maybe they will be inspired to pop the question too
xanaduim not easily impressed especially when it comes to socalled beer bars its also incredibly rare that i find a place that makes me feel totally out of my league when it comes to knowing whats what we sit down at the bar and my friend asks for a recommendation sorry dude ive met my match ive never even heard of half of thesethe owner knows beer seems that most of the customers do too or at least they know they can rely on recommendations from the knowledgeable staff amazing taps schlenkerla fastenbier im in love great list of bottles the ones i could identify anyway though i have to say for a bottle of edelstoff is pretty steep but whatever the meat and cheese plates looked really interesting too again i had no idea what half of the selections even were but im sure ill be sampling many of them in the near future they also had what appeared to be homemade apple pie plus a pickle plate and hardboiled eggs with a neat little salt bowl thing interest take on bar munchies i like iti will probably make several new friends at this bar i will probably double my beer knowledge at this bari will undoubtedly have frequent hangovers as a result of this bar i might renew my lease in this terrible building so i can keep walking to this bar in under ten minutesthis definitely makes my top beer bars of all time
very beautiful library with the loveliest old lions guarding the steps its a little complicated to get booksyou have to submit a paper requesting the book and then people in the basement get them for you and send them up even that is exciting though so i advise you to go even if you have no purpose and check out a book that sounds interesting pick any word and follow iti used the word legend

ok lets be frank my head is a nightmare the interior aside the hair is at best problematic at worst terrifying there was only one woman who could tame it amy at city salon in san francisco ive been going there for the better part of nine years she has seen everything that the tempest atop my head will throw at her the seasonally reversing swirl the inexplicable bald spot on the side the prominent occipital bun she has been the most consistent woman in my life for nigh on a decade sure ill admit that ive strayed once or twice out of town on business too much to drink in a hotel bar and ive been known to pay a visit to some cheap tramp with a pair of scissors and a come hither smile with predictable results each time ive returned chagrined and amy has had the grace to forgive my weakness and fix whatever damage has been wrought but through circumstance beyond our control amy and i have had to go our separate ways i moved to new york and despite my pleadings she stayed behind i refrained from getting a haircut for far too long since our parting sitting shiva with my head i decided that it was time to get on with my life it took me an extra few weeks to drum up the courage new city new life new haircut i turned to yelp rose suggested sassy fashion and i decided to give it a try i felt like a widower going out on his first blind date paulette was busy but louie took me well in hand he was sensitive to my needs understanding of my situation he went to work a whirl of clippers the snicker snack of scissors and i was squirming like a bag full of pythons then with a tenderness known only to hairdressers battlefield medics and men of the cloth he suggested that for the last nine years amy had been doing everything wrong i almost stood up and walked out its bad enough that im cheating on the memory of my dead spouse but do you have to tell me that she wasnt any good in the sack only the scissors in his hand and his cool professional demeanor kept me seated in the chair i looked him in the eye and said the fateful words fine do it your way half an hour later as he was putting the finishing touches on my brand new coif i realized that he was right for the last nine years my head looked like the lovechild of elvis ted koppel and foghorn leghorn now it looked like a gay investment banker im neither but i felt as though i could finally throw off the black veil and go about my brand new life thank you louie and he only charged me to boot of course the real verdict will be delivered tonight by my friend caroline the judge of all such things ill let you know how my hair performs update caroline has judged the haircut to be just fine bordering on great we both concluded that it did exacerbate a preexisting resemblance to tintin but as long as i avoid hanging out with gruff sailors or fuzzy white dogs i should be all good ill post some pictures shortly
shabu shabu i love you with bubble tea on top probably one of my favorite shabu places in the city its a really small place probably fits no more than people max each table fits about people and its big enough that each person can have their own individual shabu shabu that was definitely unique to me now i can bring my friends who dont eat meat or those who dont like seafood or those who like the soup really really spicy there are three types of shabu you can pick a la carte mini shabu and the regular shabu for standard shabu fare at this restaurant includes a variety of vegetables enoki mushrooms fresh spinach chinese cabbage tofu two different types of noodles vermicelli and udon you can also pick from different types of soup base sake dashi beef chicken and house broth seafood and pork the bf and i had the house broth with the seafoodbeef combo it was delicious the best part of shabu shabu is definitely the soup at the end and only if you have the right combo does it come out sweetly flavored and delicious you also get different types of dipping sauces talk about variety they also have a huge selection of sushi we tried all of which had creative names and were very fresh i was impressed
after a long and thorough sift through nycs many tattoo parlors i finally found what i was looking for at inkstop i went in here one day despite its janky appearance and was amazed by the work i saw in one artists bookcrazy stonework shading the artist in question was not there that day but when i came back to meet him and we realized wed both skated at derby park in santa cruz caof all places it was on while the place itself might not be much to look at regino slangs ink with the best of em his work is superban expert on shading colorwork and comedy all of these traits are extremely important when youre gonna spend in a chair putting on a handdrawn halfsleeve throughout my sessions here i got to know regino better and found him to be a real standup guy who cares about his work and his customers satisfaction they always have a mix of punk thrash and hiphop bumping on the system and the jokes just flow endlessly ben another artist there is also great with the needles and has a kicktotheribs comedic attitude regino gave me great prices and gave me a session for free once when i brought him some tequila back from mexicoguess i plucked a heart string this place is fantastic all around they dont have to look pretty or charge ridiculous amounts like ny adorned to be a considered one of the best shops in nyc turning out some of the best work in the worldlush lifeps as much as i like to drink i would strangely make that strongly recommend abstaining before getting tattedafterward it really helps to take the burn away thougharrrre
i worked just across the street when i worked in nyc and there wasnt a week thatd go by that i wasnt in there at least times while everything was conveniently located you could still spend all your time in their enjoying the beautiful range of flowers to the breads smelling fresh to the taste of the deep and dark chocolate of fat witch browniehale hearty soups is the absolute best reason to go here though no soup nazis are they you can sample everything and they seem happy though overwhelmed to give you a taste everything you could possibly need to enjoy a meal can be found right here
the look and feel of this place are something special and thankfully the coffee and food measure up as well i wont get into too many details suffice to say that one chilly january morn my tequilabeaten soul was revived by a technically supereor coffee and an egg sandwich that was clearly designed by someone who understands the importance of cheese in striking back against the tyranny of a nyc hangover and yes i do think cities develop their own styles of hangovers and new yorks most recent contribution to this study wasspectacular ed the barista is cool too
honestly i havent bought much from these guys other than coffee i just dont have a regular need for lox or gefiltefish but i can tell you their coffee is quite good and the service is always excellent i just think its great that the place is still familyowned on occasion when ive been in there ive spoken to the youngest russ and hes very friendly and personable i dunno that makes me like the place
jacques torres even the name sounds good the chocolate is even better its worth the price damn this got me thinking about it ill be there in an hour
wellkept little secret that i checked out after reading bengies review this place is indeed incredible dont spend hundreds of dollars on designer stuff find bargains and save money designers promise def helps
my first visit was confusing and fun i was handed this little green ticket at the door by a man who rambled something about giving it back to him when i left the ticket looked like a bus transfer or carnival ticket that you hole punch i had no idea what this thing was for but i held onto it figuring that it would explain itself later the restaurant was expansive it was one large rectangular room with simple wooden chairs and tables that took up of the dining room and a deli counter that ran along the right side of the dining room there were all sorts of old framed photographs along the back wall and the menu was on old school plastic boards posted over the counter what a great old place to take pictures each carver had his own line so dont be like me and walk blindly forward following the herd of people eventually i figured out that carvers further down the counter had short lines i ordered the pastrami sandwich which says on the menu ask for mayo at your own peril i like mayo on my sandwiches but i opted to skip it since the carvers all seemed pretty busy the carver cut off a piece of pastrami for me to munch on while he completed my sandwich and it was so delicious i couldnt wait to get this back to the office and eat it he packed up some sour pickles for me and asked for my green ticket he wrote on the back what i ordered and how much i owed i tipped him and then walked back towards the cashier where i turned in my ticket and paid my for the sandwich pricy yes but i have no qualms paying this since the sandwich lasted me two meals and i still had some pickles for the next day
the one on sullivan street is excellentthe only thing wrong is that the zuchini pizza hasfallen in qualtiy and gone up in price its nowsoggy and tasteless chocolate torte is to die forsesame bread is excellent too
im surprised no one has reviewed this lovely little shop this is a store with personality they are definitely a part of the neighborhood complete with a guy who sits in the store all day just to gab with the owner it was really hot the day i visited and i wasnt thinking hmmm i think i need a nice warm hat for my already sweatsoaked head but i couldnt resist their selection they had a good variety of hats costing from to many of them were simple elegant pieces with unique little touches others were decorated with flashy feathers and other ornate objects the owner of the shop was more than accommodating and helped me with the fit and size i have an enormous head it seems
oh heaven sabons lotions cremes scents and scrubs are the best i have ever used while yes it is a little expensive it is well worth the pricei love the bath wash in patchouli lavander and when i use the dead sea bath scrub my body feel likes it been to a wonderful spa the smell alone thrills memy best friend from texas visited me she was absolutly aghast at my studio apartment propensity to eat out and the amount of money i spend on entertainment the only thing she was impresed at was my sabon scrub and lotion that she used everyday
my fiancee brought me here as a surprise shortly before our trip to san francisco and a reservation at the french laundry i think the reviews posted thus far speak to the level of service you should expect the wine sommelier makes you feel like a champ even if you know littletonothing about wine and he knows the dishes as if he created them himself ive read some comments elsewhere how people have left hungry if you select the ninecourse menu youd have to be fat bastard to leave hungry just when you think youre done with everything you get a tiered presentation of petits fours and a little goodie bag of macaroons to go you may poohpooh the idea of going to the mall for a fancy meal but when youre floating or rolling down to street level afterward you wont notice the difference the only reservation left is for pm not a problem youll finish your meal in about four hours and still have time to party if you can still move after all that food the problem i have with nine course tasting menus is that its hard to remember everything i eat im left mostly with the sensation of the overall experience which is one of wonderment and awe however several dishes stand out the cornets salmon tartare with sweet red onion creme fraiche are wonderful but what remains engraved in my memory is oysters and pearls two pearlsized oysters floating on a tapioca sabayon and garnished with osetra caviar anyone who eats this in two bites should be summarily ejected from the premises when we were served this dish again at the french laundry it was all i could do to keep myself from fistpumping and yelling another dish i remember is a pasta with truffles dish that was served when i requested a substitution heavenly the bowl was angled steeply along the edges sort of like a wine glass with just enough space for you to just drop your head in and eat sans fork the deconstructed snickers photo attached sparked a debate over whether thomas keller had to request permission to use the name or if mars begged him for the publicity the composed cheese course is one cheese with several accompaniments so you can explore the various facets of the cheese in detail if you order coffee the milk will be warmed if youre dying to eat here and cant get through the reservations line in the morning rush call back later in the day and ask to be put on the waiting list youll be allowed to pick several days and if theres a cancellation theyll call you just be prepared to move on a moments notice guys jacket is required but ive had a curious experience with that policy the first time we went i didnt know where we were going so i had a dress shirt but no jacket they didnt turn us away in fact no one said anything on our second visit it was june and hot so i had my jacket on my arm before the hostess escorted us into the restaurant she smiled and discreetly motioned for me to put on my jacket i took it off again promptly after seating no injury no penalty i havent been back since the mandatory service charge was added when youre done with your meal be sure to ask for a tour of the kitchen youll also be taken inside the wine vault if you want to remember what you ate you can always ask for a copy of the menu on your way out but i dont think they deliver
ever feel like your life is like a movie me too villa mosconi makes me feel like i just walked into the godfather sans the part where you gotta get up close like this and bada bing you blow their brains all over your nice ivy league suit smack dab in da middle of your linguine alla vongoledark incognito wood family atmosphere and some of the most authentic homestyle italian food ive had in new york their seafood is impeccable and they are great for business dinners famiglia or otherwise placating those among us who can be temperamental and itchyfingered and even those with the most finicky of palates if you dont quite know what you want just ask them theyll make you an offer you cant refuse and for the record i got absolutely no problems tellin villa mosconi i love you with alla my heart if i dont seea you again soon ima gonna die capisce
five stars for wsj customer service i like the contents of the paper too but thats not what this review is about its about noisy paper deliveries at am why the hell doesnt everyone just read the news online save trees every night the wsj delivery guys woke me up throwing newspapers against my neighbors garage doors were in two rows of townhouses separated by a driveway so the noise echoes you wake up thinking its a quake or a driveby i am in la after all i went to war with the la times delivery dept a few years back in a similar situation in an apartment building the delivery guy would run down the stairs and jump over the banister in the hallway next to my bedroom thunk thunk thunk kaboom every morning am i got no justice from the la times after months of struggle so finally moved i expected the same from the wsj i called their national customer service and was told the delivery supervisor for my neighborhood would get back to me yeah when pigs fly i thought he did the very next morning he apologized and told me the guys would be quiet from that day on they are life is good
its been a while since ive been here considering i live in chicago but i always think about caravan of dreams it was definitely the best meal i had in new york and probably the best vegetarian food ever and ive been vegetarian for over years the atmosphere is pretty cool i felt really comfortable here the selection was amazing they have selections for every level of vegetarian vegan rawlive food etc
funky broome is indeed funky and it is also on broome street its kind of like the chinese hipster restaurant with young hip waitstaff and modern designer color lighting the cuisine is fairly straightforward american chinese food i like the salt pepper squid and greens they do the free oranges at the end thing
so hip so excellent so well tailored everything about this label is amazingly well done and held to a consistent aesthetic even the guy working in the store looks exactly as someone in such a place should slightly traditional and unbearably cool a dear good friend of mine bought two coats here the likes of which i have not seen anywhere else a beautiful meeting of traditional english wool and tweed with urban cool lines as close to couture as you can get in a boutique all the detailing is breathtaking update designed by alexandre plokhov a russian emigre makes me so proud
i swear im going to throw my next party thereit was awesome yelptinis are even better than cosmos and fontanas is so coolthe bathrooms arent even icky
i know ex new yorkers who still order pickles from here no kidding they have barrels of pickles shipped cross country because they are just that good
you need a bib and asbestosnew york magazine just gave the chocolate soup dumpling balls the most delicious chocolate dessert in nyc award since all the other places require ties this is probably the easiest and cheapest way to indulge yourself but be careful were talking scalding hot jets of chocolate pumping out of the holes made by your incisors its dangerous chocolate in terms of savory dumplings i like to do a mix of porks and ducks i know that sounds dangerous toothe guys who manage the place are friendly even though one of them hates the shrimp dumplings and longs for you to write in comments validating his taste buds its clean welllit fast and i think pretty healthyexcept im not kidding about the danger balls get them but watch out also if you want a laugh go to the website rickshawdumplingscom i dont think you can actually order the chef or the manager but im sure theyd be tasty too
this is just one of my new restaurants food was sooo good that i couldnt keep my fork down the staff was warm and approciable and the decor was simple and warm the price was on the high side but after the food its worth every penny i deff reccomend it
the place is charming romantic really and the food was delicious the risotto special wasnt described correctly but what i got was better than what i thought i was ordering it came on a long narrow plate with spinach salad at one end a fantastically yummy vegetable tart in the middle and creamy risotto with asparagus and tomato at the other end just the right portion size and a wonderful combination of flavors dessert was the lemon poppyseed souffle as good as it was unusual cant wait to go back
this is my and my boyfriends favorite restaurant we literally go there for any special occasion and if we have the money and dont have a special occasion we still go my boyfriend knows the owner from a coffeebar he used to so we go and it is totally fun to feel like we are regulars we would really be regulars if we had more money to spend going therei am not even sure where to begin the atmosphere is welcoming with huge wrap around windows cushion seats and funky wooden tables the bar area is small but has enough seats to grab a drink at if you are waiting the bathroom is downstairs under the stairs with these cute little tilesthe kitchen that is upstairs is open for all to see and the chefs and all so nicethe menu is inventive and fresh and seems to accommodate the seasoni cant even begin to describe the amazing steak i had the first time i went about a year ago it was melt in your mouth good the food is always fresh with certain items from the farmers markets and the dessert literary can make you fall off your chairthe have these amazing milk and cookies that are baked fresh for you there on the spotand you cant forget about the cocktails which are named great names to complement whatever season you are ini am totally shocked that this place is not packed with reservations which you can make for the next yearif you have not checked this place out please please do

great muffins smoothies and coffee drinks the chai tea is unlike any other ive had if only they had couches id want to live there a tip show up after and try for discounted dayold muffins
this place is awesome one of the best all around dining experiences ive had great space and atmosphere i pretended i was jay z maybe it was because i was wearing all white and a white top hat or maybe it was because i pictured c notes dropping out of my pocket at each step but we ordered apps galore entrees dessert bottles of winethe works i was like babygirl dont you worry this is your nightwaiter please my babygirl only eats dessert that is served on top of silk pillows and please bring her some toast but you might say dr i saw you there and you were with some old college friends i say whatever there are always two sides to every story
im perpetually amazed by the food at becco the cuisine is delicious and a relative bargain for the size of the portions the ossobuco reminds you why you cant eat it every day even if you want to and the pork chop is so good youd eat arnold from green acres but the king high potentate of the menu is the sinfonia di pasta a bottomless plate of three perniciously good pastas enough to make dr atkins recant his evil ways whats more the wine selection is spectacular with an extensive list in the range and the waitstaff charming and informed becco rules the row

little did i know my trip to the museum of modern art last week turned out to be a decent substitute for ces the consumer electronics show in las vegas i didnt intend to get an electronics junkies fix from moma so i was surprised to find two exhibits that conjured up images of cesthe first exhibit celebrated pixars years as an animation studio it was admittedly annoying to dodge the gaggles of olds half of the parents in new york city decided the pixar exhibit was a good excuse to schlep their families to the museum fortunately olds are too short to block the view so the exhibit was still excellent i left with a better appreciation for how critical are the talented human artists behind the animation computers make it all possible but the creativity and vision still come from people not from machineseven more impressive than the pixar stuff was an installation by janet cardiff i wandered into a room devoid of everything but two benches surrounded by speakers configured in a large oval cardiff recorded a chorus and replicated the sound by channeling each voice through one of the speakers it was among the most interesting aural experiences ive ever had you could walk through the room stopping in front of an individual speaker and it was as if you were standing nosetonose with one member of the chorus or you could just sit on the couch in the middle and take it all in it is definitely something that needs to be experienced in person not in print
heres a story i brought home a sugar sweet sunshine pumpkin pie for thanksgiving my mom had also bought a pumpkin pie at her favorite bakery of ten years not in nyc so we conducted a taste test she took a bite of her pie loved it then she took a bite of my pie and no joke she gasped her jaw dropped open she said mina if you dont bring this pie home every time you come i wont let you in the house i have similar stories for their brownies their bread pudding their raspberry bars their apple pie and of course cupcakes i gotta say f magnolia im so sick of people talking about how magnolia is this magnolia is that what magnolia is is hyped up beyond belief take nibble out of a sugar sweet sunshine cupcake from any of their numerous flavors pistachio red velvet chocolate yellow and the magic of the worlds best cupcakes will be unleashed in your mouth its cheaper tastier healthier and will give you more pleasure than crack though its probably more addictive i am a sugar sweet sunshine evangelist can you tell
i dont know how one would survive growing up in this town without dominicks its the only pizza place in the area that includes about other pizza joints that doesnt deliever because they dont have to dominicks is worth gettin off you lazy butt and driving down there for the gnocchi are amazing and so are the cavitelli but yet for some reason every time i order i am compelled into spaghetti parm dont remember when i conjured this up but theyve been makin it for me ever since
service a food a decor b dessert a nobu is the best japanese restaurant period if you are to visit nobu lunch time would be the best bet as dinner reservation would take month when you are to visit nobu you should be adventurous and focus on chefs specialties because teriyaki dishes fresh sushi and sashimi can be found else where tuna tataki average dish simply forgettable squid pasta extremely tender squid with light sauce good choice of vegetable to accompany the squid texture rock shrimp tempura one of the highlighted dishes and is perfect with the spicy sauce broiled black cod with miso my personal favorite subtly marinated with miso and had light sweet taste yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno creative dish that actually works bento box warm chocolate cake with green tea ice cream average cake but the pairing with slightly bitter green tea ice cream to counter the sweetness of the cake is well thought apple spring rolls very refreshing but i question the pairing with the accompanying ginger ice cream the mixed drinks are expensive but very worth it we tried the lychee martini and mango martini overall you will get what you pay for the dishes are very creative and delicious
one of the larger crunchs with plenty of available equipment and lots of hot guys a motivational workout
one of my favorite art museums so far theres simply too much to see here in one day i think believe theres no general admission fee just a donation of any value so its a great place for students
if youre looking for a satisfying sandwich for lunch i would go here they should have more places like this in midtown for ones who have no where else to eat besides the shaker salads you get day in and day outall the bodegas need to start making banh mi for surei think they would have a lot better business if this were the case
once you get past the fact that difaras probably has not been cleaned since the nixon administration you are in for a real treat by way of the best pizza in new york the old man is some kind of genius with herb garden growing beside the ovens and his meticulous attention to detail some things in life are worth the waitlike the jayz and nas reunion tearand a slice from difaras is equally worth the wait i once waited minutes to get a slice only to devour it in seconds and then return for a minute wait to get a second slice i think your best bet is to spring for a pie because if you opt for a single slice you will be left pining for more sitting and waiting has its advantages at difara though when the joint gets really packed you get to witness this neurotic ballet performed by locals hipsters who probably read about difaras in the village voices best of ny and whoever else is waiting for the divine offerings of difaras people will get up ten times or more during their wait and nervously pace the floor by the counter as if after years in the business the old man is finally going to fuck up and its going to be their order the old man is so calm though its almost scary if i had to run a booming mom pop business like that with minimal help id be a nervous wreck but if one truly wants to measure the greatness of a difara slice first head over to one of avenue js countless kosher pizza joints try one of their slices and then grab one at difaras the choice is clear the jews may be gods chosen people but difaras is gods chosen pizza
in one of those strange moments when i found myself walking on a block in manhattan realizing id never been on that particular block before i discovered that between is a little stripper neighborhood nestled at the foot of the empire state building this block caters to various adult contingencies strippers and the people who visit them i noticed an adult cinema a strip club and empire exotics a fancy nasty lingerie store which was handy for me because i needed to pick up a fishnet unitard to go under a moisturizer costume i was overjoyed to find it there for only at least less than i would have expected to pay at rickys i hurried in out expeditiously got what i needed but i noticed a comprehensive array of pasties crotchless knickers schoolgirl outfits and the like theyre on the worldwide web at empireexoticscom for discreet shoppers
a nofrills steakhouse that opened in peter luger is not the place for elegant atmosphere the dining rooms with their exposed beams and worn wooden furniture actually feature sawdustcovered floors orwell even courtesy from the wait staff it is also the best reason to journey to brooklyn menus are not provided one diner in my party was given a withering look and told no menuyou eat steak and steak it ishandpicked dryaged buttercoated porterhouse steaks which arrive on insanely hot platters if you comment that the steak is too rare the waiter will advise you to continue cooking it on the side of the platter starters feature amazing thickly cut slabs of tomato covered in peter lugers own steak sauce creamed spinach and doublethick bacon patrons really dont get a choice about eatingwhen the spinach was served i attempted to refuse but was told spinach is goodyou eat as it hurtled down to my plate and dammit it was good dessert consists of chocolate mousse pie and new yorkstyle cheesecake both of which come with a giant bowl of whipped cream along with the coffee one of my hapless codiners timidly asked for milk she was given another dirty look as the waiter scooped up a huge spoonful of the whipped cream and piled it on top of her coffee the waiters attitude was hilariouspossibly all the more funny to us because we actually think he was seriousand the food was by far the best around note peter luger is cash only so hit the atm ahead of time
beautiful hotel with spacious rooms and a staff who treats you like you are the only guest there it has a very traditional old world feel without feeling stuffy great spa and indoor pool the top floor bar has a fantastic view as well and takashimaya is just around the corner i have a special affinity to this hotel firstly its the place where my husband and i stayed when we got engaged still happily married secondly its where i practically brushed shoulders with robert plannt he was walking in big strides as i was heading towards the exit we passed each other i looked over and second seconds oh my god thats robert plant i casually turned and looked back caught him looking back as well he winked smiled and i nearly fell over
crosby is one of the less assuming streets in soho so the housing works used book store and cafe is easy to overlook but you should make a point of finding it the former warehouse classic tin front and all now houses one of the best collections of used and rare books and one of the most pleasant cafes and performance venues in manhattan just inside the door you exchange your bag for a claim tag with a famous writers name on it and i swear the volunteer staff have serendipitous fingers i almost always get a particular favorite first stop the racks the frequent treasures turn over quickly so throw bookshelf or luggage space anxieties aside and buy the ones that leap into your arms posthaste the poetry and nonfiction live on the second floor balcony you can only get to by scaling one of the spiraling castiron exactly like the ones in old libraries peculiar recluses always have in disney films the little tables on the balcony are my favorite place to read in the city but heyre frequently occupied for collectors and bibliophiles the really rare items are behind glass at the front and behind the counter i cant look at the shelves behind the volunteer cashiers without a small sigh of regret for the first edition condensed oed i passed up the two volume set with that comes in a little shelf with a slot for the magnifying glass thats included im a fool the cafe volunteers may need to ask for assistance theyre not professional baristas after all and if you want to be a coffee snob youd best head elsewhere but you can get reasonable coffee and espresso drinks a perfectly drinkable glass of table wine or a simple pastry or dessert if youre feeling peckish before a poetry reading the high ceilings are more than a pleasant respite from city crowding they also provide spectacular acoustics for occasional rock shows the best part by far its a nonprofit all proceeds go to assist people living with aids in the city
this super market has it all a great import section where you can get everything from mh balls chutney to real heinz baked beans like they serve them in europe great organic produce and natural foods section about two aisles and a freezer aisle yields pretty much everything you needthough i didnt find the vegan cheesebut if you like dairy cheese this is the place to go looks like they have tons of cheese i think the meat section is equally as substantial i averted my eyes but i think i saw some bloody stumps hanging somewhere next to the cheese huge parking lots fairway is located along the westside highway at street get off the street exit its easy to access by car and the parking lot has a lovely view of the hudson river always a pleasure to come out of a great food shopping experience and walk out to your car parked along the hudson river worth the trip shop during the day this place gets jammed during after work hours they sell beer too
okay i need to explain my star rating system since it is definitely not based upon the normal hotel review systema bunch of friends were playing a rugby tournament in ny for the weekend and i stopped in to partyvisitsleep on the ground coincidently a few other friends were staying in the same hotel so needless to say this must be a pretty cheap place to stay the rooms are ghetto and smallbut from other reviewers i guess this is the norm in nyc i dont know where im going with thisoh yeah okay so i loved this place because yes i knew practically everyone staying there at least by the end of the night and more importantly at in the morning the lobby was basically the place to be all tourists partying drinking and eating pizza and conglomerating without any busybody security guards breaking up the fun that is why i gave it five stars god i really forgot how to do these yelp reviewsthis is awful haha
dont joke about this place make it here and you know why nyc has it so good at a party the previous night i met some people from san francisco talking about how this is where you get really fresh intersting stuff no admission to get in its an active community for the designers it an eye full for the shopper i got an amazing white coat that was made as a dkny sample i was skimming at other things in the person set up area and she just sized me up and pulled out a coat that makes me not fear the winter and i got these fresh bracelets made of vinyl records with images screened on i got a cuff that covers my armband of a skater and a hasidic jew if only they could be one
the place to go for fries a sandwich after a movie at amc within walking distance from pabt which works out well for us losers who had to schlep it back to nj last bus leaves at
i should warn you that i belong to this community garden so im completely biased i think its totally wonderful and my life in new york wouldnt be complete without it i love the people and the flowers and the fishpond i come here to see fireflies in august i water peoples plots when theyre on vacation i make ice cream with children whose parents i know by sight i attend bimonthly meetings and vote on what color to paint the gazebo they chose this salmon color instead of haystack yellowteaching me that democracy doesnt always work to the best advantage anyhow its always open on the weekends and many evenings you can come in as well if a member is pottering about a very nice place to sit still for a while or email me and ask to host a party or to join the garden id be into it
my familiarity with zenlike bathroom of the mercer is strong since i had to escape there during dinner with sothebys furniture expert somehow he was taller when appraising my antiques than when taking me to dinner maybe because of all that crawling under century table it was sexier in apartment than in restaurant also he has strange bicycle chain permanently attached around wrist i wanted to cut it off with big steak knife food far surpassed conversation and bathroom was a welcome refuge with very zenlike sink faucets and little river stones for meditation repeat to self even though i am afraid i will fall asleep face down in soup if i have to listen to more cracklefinish chair history i completely love and respect myself yes in datecrises even natashka can be newage i didnt think it could happen either but i promise that the river stones would have the same effect on you
once upon a time there was a huge bookstore that defied all the corporate impersonality of borders and barnes and noble and stood proudly on street and broadway home to the famous miles of books the strand bought back used books on a daily basis so it was a great place to browseoften then one day a small band of travelers tried to find a relatively common book slowness by milan kundera the travelers entered the formidable city of books but were instantly overwhelmed by the sheer numbers surrounding them they were contemplating turning back in defeat when suddenly out of the dusty aisle came a mysterious bookseller who showed them the way gathering up souvenirs left and right the travelers turned back to the door elated with their purchases and counting the hours until their triumphant return to the store named after a famous street of publishers in london and they lived happily ever after
great little boutique in nolita that caters to stylish expecting mothers i was in ny for a tradeshow last year and completely unprepared for the sudden blossom being a clotheshorse and worried that i had to spend the next few weeks on the east coast without proper attire i had no choice but to outfit myself with a new wardrobe from cadeau i read about this place a few years back and was waiting for the right time their styles range from city chic to cool boho and few things inbetween cool styles cool shop and a pampering staff you cant go wrong
this is why we dont use citysearch anymore none of their reviewers have a clue as to why this place is such a gem although their site did tell me ginos address which was useful in adding the restaurant to yelp but allow me to describe the restaurant in question on a sunday night when the usuals are headed back from the hamptons its unusually empty meaning you can actually get a seat no reservations no credit cards no wonder this place was sinatras favorite just like your italian grandfathers kitchen i highly recommend ginos to anyone who doesnt need frills just authentic italian deliciousness with real new york ambiance
few markets are closer to my heart or to my former residence than this one a joy a joy arrive with patience it is always crowded and it is big too try taking the packed elevator to the organics floor their large helpful and amusing signs instructing on the origins of their organic beef new zealand or above the checkout lines on why you should appreciate your current life because life in the century was significantly worse i had pondered this before but was glad to be reminded additionally that this is the best value for price of fresh groceries that i found in new york probalby a quarter of what equivalent items would cost at that massive whole foods on central park happens to be the most expensive in the country i have never been to the famed harlem store though ive heard it features a walkin freezer as well as down jackets for customers use i might just add that this is not a bad place to meet someone you havent see for a while theres something decidedly sexy about that flourescent light flickering over the ripe peaches and flowers in the dimming evening light and its not the fresh fruit that makes your heart skip a beat
for the love of all things holy theyre open hours and at a major bus stopsubway corner etc theres no reason to go to the donut place next door they make bagels and bread on premises all night long and will always be able to find something warm to put your sandwich on liza would walk here from palo alto if she knew how good the challah was though the bread tends to be slightly better at the ave location a few blocks east and on rosh hashanah the challah is huge and round weeeeee

best espresso in nyc and my good friend google agrees with me so i went on a little rr in nyc visiting friends and my buddy josh a foodie and espresso naziconnisseur showed me some new spots so i tell him i want the best espresso in town ill pay for the cab lets go so he tells me we can walk to this joint about blocks away and on the way he tells me about acidity and foam and temperature and on and on after sitting down in the charming caferestaurant i was thoroughly impressed because the place smelled italian its tough to explain but old places in europe have this funky smell that you remember forever and this joint must have imported some euro stank for authenticity it worked i was charmed out of my pants and the espresso was the best ive ever had and ive drank my share it was not too acidic and lingered all over my mouth with a deep richness after getting home i had forgotten the name of this amazing cafe and so knowing how much of a critic josh is i googled best espresso nyc and low and behold the first result was via quadronno check out their website and you can see where we sat right below the viking mural
dont you love bathrooms that have those embossed disposable towelettes next to sink theres something so charming i think about having a little stack of them to keep in your own bathroom especially when they were aquired at ralph lauren home store classiness of embossed towelettes in my experience was only surpassed by the ritz bathroom in rome whose toiletpaper comes from fabriano worldfamous papermakers and is watermarked with the same name exquisite

unique amazing a highly artistic gathering that will stick in your mind enter into this converted mayonnaise factory and stare into what appears to be a massive drop off onto a lower level but what really is a water reflection doing a tremendous job playing with light and image enjoy art concerts comedy and other organized events such as a show for hurricane katrina relief i arrived and saw what i would describe as a body art show a sort of strip show in which the performer could have been a man or a woman or both we werent quite sure galapagos is a true product of williamsburg
my cousin told me to check out this place that was about to open on franklin street in greenpoint bki got excited cause to be honest there are not too many great restaurants in the area that i have not been to tons and tons of times liza queen the owner is from upstate new york but she cooks in a southern style they serve you bowl of boiled peanuts in vinegar instead of breadthe place is small with only or so table on the inside but the back yard is expansive and has a dog and a cat roaming around the menu changes all the time but the few times ive gone i have never been disappointeditems range from a pork picnic to chicken pot pie and my favorite starter hush puppies the down side is that they only take cash and they dont have their liquor licence but they do have a cork fee so you can byob be prepared to wait a while if there is a line because everything is made to order and takes a while to simmerthe wait is well worth it and its about time there was a great place in greenpoint to spend all your hard earned money at
triple crowns still relatively new but the words already pretty much out about this place and deservedly so its a pretty cool bar out in williamsburg that plays good hiphopsoulrbfunky music but without the pretentiousness of a megaclub because its developed such a solid rep or street cred to use the parlance of our times they have a lot of guest djs including ali shaheed muhammad of tribe called quest fame who often spins on thurs nights sometimes theres a cover but its rarely if ever more than i wish i had more hands so i could give triple crown four thumbs up
these puffs are like happy clouds of light cream the choux pastry is light and the the visible vanilla beans in the cream isnt too sweet depending on what time of day you stroll by there might be a line but it moves fast and its always worth it they introduce new treats occasionally and they offer new flavors of puffs as a special my favorites are still the original and green tea the staff members are just as cute light and sweet as the treats they sell
one of queens hidden gems ive been going to this zoo since i was a tot and i must say the petting zoo section is just as fun now as it was when i was six walking through the zoo itself is a very relaxing meditative experience so long as its not too crowded which it usually isnt if youre looking for a mellow cheaper alternative to the bronx zoo haul your ass to queens for a few hours and check out the cool animals
there are some good times to be had in here if your cousin is a metalhead who lives around the corner from this place youre in for some of the same whiskeyloaded fun that i always have at the raven cheap strong drinks are my favorite kind and the bartenders here arent joking around the crowd is nicely diverse and free of priss and it feels kind of like a studentpunkmetal version of cheers

kims video is like a movie rental store in an independent movie with a quirky staff and interior design its all good though and the staff seems to have somehow memorized every movie ever made if you are at a loss as to what movie to rent the employees picks are the best now for the really good part they have movies that you will not find under the same roof anywhere else and they have the cheapest rentals in new york if you think for an older film or tv show even just released or for a just released film that was in the theaters last month is expensive than there is no pleasing you
