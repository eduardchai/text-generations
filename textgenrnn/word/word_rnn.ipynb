village located downstairs le boucherie on christopher street there are only seats and employees and its all they need beware of the brightness of light and i had go back to the terraces to grab sunglasses when we went the first time but if you expect an authentic japanese sushi omakase then this place is perfect no music brightly lit and the theater of sushi you wont believe the service and hospitality i never had an empty glass and returning to my seat at the sushi bar there are no tables my napkin is delicately folded and waiting for me we first went on an anniversary and we were gifted a book about tatsu i wish i had a book about me to give people when they came to my sushi restaurant but i do not have a sushi restaurant nor am i a sushi chef nor do i have a book so i just give people my fake music album on audio compact disc when they bring their own sushi to my standup has mentioned the toothpicks in the bathroom every time we go so dont miss out on that i just cant say enough good things about the sushi so i wont say anything at all for fear of using my entire vocabulary up in one yelp review and not being able to speak in public which is largely what i do for a living for me this is the crown jewel of japanese food in new york city tatsu is humble brilliant inventive and funny his associates are every bit as talented and essential\n","\n","166/166

food while writing this review. my bf booked this for my first? i was totally impressed by the service, then some of the good - top 40s pop, and not even more delightful. the * pork chop was absolutely divine. it was served / slices of grilled summer peach, sauteed chard, & sweet corn. the meat was tender and perfect. slow and bites were to take in all that juicy flavorful meat. it paired perfectly / the peach & veggies. bottom line: say to my (old) favorite pork chop entree. you have been to squeeze the lemon on top and just enjoy my deliciousness. now, i'm not sure my friend - - house of prime rib with some cinnamon - taste, and cooked the right batter to ratio. the bacon wrapped mochi was a little. the mochi was chewy as expected, but lacked flavor which thankfully mr.
